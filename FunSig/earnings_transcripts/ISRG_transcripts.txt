===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-22 04:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical, Inc.'s First Quarter 2025 Earnings Release. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. . And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Dan Connally, Head of Investor Relations at Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead, sir.
Dan Connally: Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; Dave Rosa, our President; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on January 31, 2025, and Form 10-Q filed on October 18, 2024. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will introduce the call and provide a business overview. Dave will present the quarter's business, operational and clinical highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results and procedure highlights. Then I will discuss our updated financial outlook for 2025. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn the call over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us on the call today. Our business performed well in the first quarter of the year with physicians using our products at the high end of our expectations, driven by strong procedure growth in core general surgery in the United States, and strong procedures outside the United States, new system placements in the quarter were solid with particular strength in the U.S. We are pleased with performance of each of our platforms with continued adoption of dV5 and multiport solid results in Ion and acceleration in procedures using our single port platform. Given the dynamic changes in trade policy, I'd like to describe our principles for navigating the current environment, rather than detailing any particular scenario. Our first priority is to ensure supply of our products to our customers globally. We have spent years becoming a trusted provider of great products and services. And first commitment is to maintaining the status for those who depend upon us. We believe that high-quality minimally invasive care at industrial scale will remain a global need regardless of trade policy and our long-term opportunity remains robust. We will continue to manage the business for the long-term and invest towards improvement in the quintuple aim. Given potential changes in our costs and our customers' costs across their enterprise, we do not plan reflexive changes to our pricing in the dynamic near-term environment. Our second priority will be to optimize our production costs and rebalance product flows within our existing manufacturing and supply chain footprint as policies begin to stabilize. Finally, we will adjust our supply chain strategy and assess adjustments to our pricing when we see the signs of a durable planning environment for trade. I'll now turn the call over to Dave to take you through our product, services and operating highlights. Dave?
David Rosa: Thank you, Gary. Intuitive Surgical was founded in 1995. In this, our 30th year of operations, our global da Vinci installed base in Q1 2025 exceeded 10,000 systems and over 50,000 surgeons across 70 countries perform procedures in the quarter. Thank you to our customers, our employees and all our stakeholders for your ongoing collaboration and commitment as we continue to advance minimally invasive care. Starting with procedures. Da Vinci procedure growth in the quarter was 17%. Areas of strength included general surgery in the U.S. and regional performance in India, Korea distribution markets in the U.K. In the U.S., after-hours procedure growth accelerated to 36% year-over-year. Jamie will describe procedure dynamics later in the call. Turning to capital. We placed 367 da Vinci systems in the quarter, including 147 da Vinci 5 systems and 19 SP systems. We also installed 49 Ion systems in the quarter. Capital placements were strong in the U.S. with mixed performance outside of the U.S., reflecting stresses in Germany, the U.K. and Japan. System utilization defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter, grew 2% year-over-year for our multiport platforms, 26% for SP and 5% for Ion. Solid procedure growth and capital performance supported strong revenue growth of 19% in the quarter. Product margins were within our expectations, reflecting increased depreciation from new facilities and a higher mix of newer platforms. Operating expenses were within our expectations. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call. In Q1, our rollout of da Vinci 5 progressed within our expectations with 147 systems placed and over 32,000 procedures performed across a broad set of specialties. We installed our first fully integrated system this month, which now features software to enable the integrated hub and simulator along with a host of other enhancements. Several additional features, including real-time surgical video review, real-time 3D model review and visual force feedback gauges will be enabled upon 510(k) clearance later this year. We continue to ramp our manufacturing operations and supply chain capabilities to support broad launch of da Vinci 5 midyear. Broad launch means that incorporate the latest fully integrated hardware and software and we're able to meet customer demand, including trade-ins and dual consoles. As we've discussed previously, we remain in the regulatory process in Japan and expect clearance in Europe near the end of 2025. Force Feedback is one of the core features of da Vinci 5. We are starting to see early single institution studies evaluating the impact of Force Feedback on clinical outcomes and proficiency. In an abstract presented at the North American Robotic Urology Symposium, a team led by Dr. Michael Stifelman, Chair of Urology at Hackensack University Medical Center, studied return of bowel function in a small cohort of patients. Return of bowel function in less than 24 hours is an important metric for certain operations. Of the 28 patients included, 16 patients underwent transparent neo partial nephrectomy or radical nephrectomy where Force Feedback technology was used compared with 12 patients undergoing the same procedure with standard da Vinci Xi instruments. The authors reported a significantly higher rate of recovery of bowel function within 24 hours, with 83% of the force feedback cohort compared to 25% in the non-force feedback cohort. The authors concluded that force feedback instruments and robotic-assisted kidney surgery are associated with faster bowel function recovery, suggesting potential reductions in colonic trauma. They note, as robotic-assisted surgery advances, integrating force feedback into routine practice could enhance precision and improved recovery across disciplines. Regarding time to proficiency, a second study led by a team, including Dr. Andrew Hung, Associate Professor of Urology and Computational Biomedicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, evaluated the impact of force feedback technology on the suturing performance of 29 novice surgeon in a randomized preclinical study. The study showed that force feedback technology has the potential to improve novice surgeon performance by significantly reducing tissue trauma and errors during suturing and time to complete suturing. These results are consistent with the core value hypothesis of force feedback technology, and we expect more of these types of studies to publish in 2025 and beyond. Force feedback instruments are in limited supply and we expect broad availability near the end of 2025. Use of case insight with da Vinci 5 is growing nicely, with case insights delivered on over 22,000 procedures to date. These data sets include video, kinematic energy and force data and are delivered in the context of surgical procedure steps, enabling surgeons to easily navigate the procedure video and identify meaningful operational and clinical insights. These insights will form the basis of key performance indicators and help of novice and expert surgeons identify objective measures that underpin surgical performance. As we said before, the long-term opportunity for computational tools is both significant and difficult. Validations at scale will take time and are worthy pursuit. Moving to Ion. Procedures grew 58% to approximately 31,000 in the quarter. In April, we received clearance of our Ion platform in Australia. And in China, we received our first provincial charge code. In this early phase of launch in China, we are focused on the collection of clinical data to support our broader commercialization strategy. Our priorities for Ion in the near term are supporting utilization growth in the U.S., expansion in international markets and improving product costs. Turning to SP. Procedure growth accelerated in the quarter to 94%, with solid growth in the U.S. and OUS procedures more than doubling compared to the year ago period, driven by Korea, Japan and early adoption in Europe. In the quarter, we received U.S. 510(k) clearance for da Vinci SP SureForm 45 stapler, which will support the use of SP in thoracic and colorectal indications. Our commercialization efforts in these indications will be measured as we look to establish first access sites and develop key opinion leaders in the coming quarters. In closing, we are committed to our 2025 priorities. First, focusing on the full launch of da Vinci 5, its regional clearances and follow-on feature releases. Second, we'll pursue increased adoption for our focused procedures by country through training, commercial activities and market access efforts. Third, we'll drive continued progress in building industrial scale, product quality and manufacturing optimization. And finally, we'll focus on excellence and availability of our digital tools. While periods of rapid change can create inefficiencies, as we adapt to a dynamic environment, we are well positioned operationally and financially to execute against our priorities. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances and procedure highlights in greater detail.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, and we'll also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Given that the current global trade environment is relatively dynamic, before we dive into Q1 results, let me address Tariffs. To provide some context, the footprint of our manufacturing operations is as follows. In 2024, Intuitive manufactured 98% of our robotic systems in the United States, 70% of our endoscopes in Europe and approximately 80% of our instruments and accessories in Mexico. We source raw materials and other components that go into these finished products from suppliers around the world. The net result of our manufacturing footprint and global customer demand is that Intuitive is both a significant U.S. manufacturer and has become a significant net U.S. exporter. In terms of the impacts of tariffs to Intuitive, broadly, in order of magnitude, I would characterize tariffs into the following three buckets, first, those tariffs relating to U.S.-China trade. We import into China subassemblies for domestic Xi production and completely finished excise, both of which are expected to incur Chinese tariffs of 125%. We also import components from Chinese-based suppliers into the U.S. to be incorporated into the manufacture of our products, which incur U.S. tariffs of 145%. In addition, our China JV manufactures certain products for our Ion platform that are subject to U.S. tariffs when imported for U.S. procedure demand. Second, imports into the U.S. of procured components from OUS-based suppliers and imports of endoscopes from our factories in Europe are subject to the 10% baseline tariffs and then increased tariff rates after the current 90-day pause period has elapsed. Third, while most of our products manufactured in Mexico are certified under the requirements of USMCA and therefore, are not subject to current U.S. import tariffs, a small portion do not currently meet the requirements and therefore, incur 25% tariffs upon import to the U.S. Based on the impacts just described, reflecting those tariffs that have been implemented and those that have been announced with both a stated percentage and implementation date and assuming such tariffs remain in place, we currently expect the impact to our income statement for 2025 to be additional cost of sales of approximately 1.7% of revenue, plus or minus 30 basis points. The impact of tariffs will vary with the volume of capital sales in China, the mix of procured components from OUS suppliers and the proportion of products manufactured in Mexico that are certified under USMCA. Given that tariff costs are capitalized into inventory and then recognized in cost of sales as products are sold, we would expect the impact of tariffs to increase each quarter over the remainder of the year. As a result, we are updating our estimate for pro forma gross margin to be within a range of 65% and 66.5% of revenue. This range does not reflect any potential additional tariffs or any potential inflationary impact on labor cost or the cost of procured components. To the extent that tariffs and their derivative impact has a durable impact on our cost of sales and/or demand for our products, we will consider implementation over time of a range of mitigating operational actions. However, we do not expect any such measures to have a significant beneficial impact in 2025. Turning to Q1. Core metrics were strong. da Vinci procedures grew 17%, the installed base of da Vinci Systems grew 15% and average system utilization grew 2%. Procedure growth in Q1 was adversely impacted by a lower number of business days compared to the year ago period. On a day-adjusted basis, Q1 procedure growth was 18.5%. U.S. procedures grew 13%, driven by growth in benign general surgery with relative strength in cholecystectomy, foregut and appendectomy procedures. Consistent with recent trends, bariatric procedures in the U.S. declined in the mid-single-digit range. OUS procedures grew 24%, driven by strength in India, Korea, distributor markets and the U.K. Procedure growth in Korea improved sequentially. Some portion of that higher growth may be a catch-up in procedures from prior periods as a result of the ongoing precision strike. Procedure growth in China improved from the prior quarter and was a little above the global average, driven primarily by urologic procedures. Looking at OUS performance in aggregate, we see strong procedure growth in colorectal, hysterectomy, benign general surgery, and thoracic categories. Reviewing capital performance, we placed 367 systems in the first quarter, 17% higher than the 313 systems we placed in the same period last year. First quarter placements included 147 da Vinci 5 systems, taking the total install base to 509 systems. There were 67 trading transactions in Q1 compared to 29 trade-ins last year, driven by some U.S. customers upgrading to da Vinci 5. It is important to note that we expect trade-ins to occur progressively over multiples of years as we build da Vinci 5 evidence and customers evaluate associated returns on such investments. In the U.S., we placed 204 systems in Q1, up from 148 systems last year, reflecting positive customer response to da Vinci 5. Outside the U.S., we placed 163 systems in the first quarter, down from 165 systems placed in quarter one of last year. In the first quarter of this year, we placed 88 systems in Europe, 16 in China and 10 in Japan compared with 84 in Europe, 10 in China and 20 in Japan in Q1 of last year. OUS placement performance reflects financial pressures and healthcare spending constraints in several key markets including Japan, Germany and the U.K. Customers with existing da Vinci capacity have opportunities to increase utilization, which we actively support. The environment in China continues to reflect the ongoing impact of domestic competition and policy-driven pressure on pricing. With respect to the previously mentioned tariffs of 125% on imports of excise systems and excise subassemblies into China, these tariffs have a material impact to the product cost of excise systems in China, and may adversely impact our ability to win future tenders. Given the trade environment, financial pressures faced by hospitals and risks to the macro, we may see customers globally reprioritize capital budgets or extend timelines to invest in robotic programs. First quarter revenue was $2.25 billion, a 19% increase over last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 20% and Systems revenue grew 25% year-over-year, driven by a 17% increase in da Vinci system placements and higher system ASP, reflecting a higher mix of da Vinci 5 placements. Recurring revenue grew 19% in Q1, representing 85% of total revenue. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows leading represented 54% of Q1 placements, compared with 51% last year, driven by a higher mix of U.S. placements where given customer preference the greater proportion of systems are placed under lease arrangements. While leasing may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect the rate of leasing to increase overtime. Q1 system average selling prices were $1.62 million, as compared to $1.39 million last year, primarily driven by a higher mix of da Vinci 5. Looking forward to the second half of 2025 following broad launch of da Vinci 5, to the extent that we see higher trading volumes, you should expect that such transactions reflect significantly higher trading credits relative to recent periods. We recognized $39 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter, compared with $29 million last year. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,780, flat to last year, reflecting two offsetting dynamics. First, we see I&A per procedure come down due to procedure mix, given a lower mix of bariatric procedures and higher mixed cholecystectomy. Second, we see an offsetting positive mix effect from a higher mix of procedures on our SP Platform and Insufflator Accessory and Force Feedback instrument revenue, coming from da Vinci 5 procedures. Turning to Ion. There were approximately 31,000 Ion procedures in the first quarter, an increase of 58% as compared to last year. In Q1, we placed 49 Ion systems, compared to 70 in Q1 of 2024. Four of the 49 systems were placed in OUS markets. We estimate the penetration of lung biopsy in the U.S. is approaching the halfway point. And then looking ahead, an increasing proportion of our focus will be helping customers convert Transthoracic needle aspiration biopsies to Ion, while driving increases in utilization of the existing capacity. Where we have a clearance for Ion in our U.S. markets, we are in the early phase of adoption, where our current focus is on building local ends, engaging societies and healthcare systems to see adoption of our products for the benefit of patients. We expect this to be a multiyear effort. First quarter SP procedures grew 94%, driven by strong growth in Korea and early-stage multispecialty growth in Europe and Japan. We placed 19 SP systems in Q1 compared to 24 systems last year. Quarter placements included seven in Europe, six in Korea, and five in the U.S. Average system utilization for our SP platform grew 26% in Q1. In absolute terms, SP utilization is the highest of any of our platforms in Korea and Japan. Utilization in Europe is increasing steadily. We expect utilization in the U.S. to increase as we expand indications. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2025 was 66.4% compared with 67.6% for the first quarter of 2024. The year-over-year decline in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects higher facilities costs, including depreciation as we bring on additional manufacturing capacity and a higher mix of Ion and da Vinci 5 revenue that carry lower gross margins. Our Q1 results did not reflect any significant impact from tariffs. During the quarter, we opened two new facilities at our Sunnyvale, California headquarters that expand our U.S. manufacturing and R&D footprint significantly; a 912,000 square foot facility that will contain da Vinci systems manufacturing and R&D teams; and a 315,000 square foot facility containing our Ion manufacturing and R&D team. Along with our recently opened factory in Peachtree Corners, Georgia, that manufactures X and Xi Systems, these facilities provide a space to grow over the midterm. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we continue to expect to open new manufacturing facilities in Germany and Bulgaria and expand instrument manufacturing capacity in Mexico. In addition to supporting our growth plans, we believe, over time, these new manufacturing facilities give us supply availability, quality, and cost advantages from scale and factory automation. First quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 12% compared with last year, driven by increased headcount, higher facilities-related costs, and increased legal fees. During the quarter, we increased headcount sequentially by just over 500 employees, of which approximately half were in manufacturing roles to support revenue growth. Given long-term opportunities to drive the quintuple aim and grow revenue, our resolve to invest in R&D and innovation remain unchanged. Pro forma other income was $91 million for Q1, up from $88 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.3%, in line with our expectations. First quarter 2025 pro forma net income was $662 million or $1.81 per share compared with $541 million or $1.50 per share for the first quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $698 million or $1.92 per share for the first quarter of 2025 compared with GAAP net income of $545 million or $1.51 per share for the first quarter of 2024. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $9.1 billion compared with $8.8 billion at the end of last year. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and capital expenditures of $117 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Dan to discuss our updated outlook.
Daniel Oh: Thank you, Jamie. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2025. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2025 procedure growth within a range of 13% and 16%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2025 procedure growth within a range of 15% to 17%. The low end of the range assumes growth in China is impacted by trade, environmental and competitive dynamics. Governments in key OUS markets continue to constrain hospital CapEx budgets, which limits the expansion of capacity in the field and bariatric procedures continue to decline at rates similar to recent trends. The high end of the range assumes China procedure growth improves relative to 2024, the CapEx environment improves in key OUS markets and procedure declines in bariatrics moderate. The high end of the range also assumes that procedures are not impacted by the current trade environment. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast pro forma gross profit margin in 2025 to be within a range of 67% and 68% of revenue, which reflected significant incremental depreciation as we bring on new facilities the impact of growth in newer products and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. As Jamie described earlier, we currently expect the impact of recently implemented and announced tariffs globally to impact our cost of sales by approximately 1.7% of revenue, plus or minus 30 basis points. As a result, we are updating our estimate for pro forma gross margin to be within the range of 65% and 66.5% of revenue. In regards to operating expenses, we now expect pro forma operating expense growth to between 10% and 14%. The projected operating expense growth reflects increased depreciation from new facilities and investments to drive our growth objectives. We now expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $770 million and $790 million in 2025. We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $370 million and $400 million in 2025. With regard to capital expenditures, we now estimate a range of $650 million to $750 million, primarily for planned facility construction activity. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2025 pro forma income tax rate to be between 22% and 23% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.
Travis Steed: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First, I’ll ask a question on tariffs. Just the 170 basis point impact in 2025. Just curious how to think about that on an annualized basis, any way to kind of break out how much of that is China versus Mexico and how to think about the cadence over 2025, how much of that impacts in kind of Q4 and in Q3 this year?
Jamie Samath: Yes. Travis, in terms of the breakout for this year, roughly half-ish of the impact is U.S.-China trade, both directions. And about 40% of the impact is imports into the U.S. ex-China, Mexico, Canada of raw materials and components from U.S.-based suppliers and imports of endoscopes from our factories in Europe. So that kind gives you a sense of what's driving the 1.7% of revenue. As we said in prepared remarks, the impact of tariffs kind of increases each quarter through year. So the exit rate in Q4 is going to be higher than the 1.7%. There is some variability there with respect to - for example, where Chinese capital sales fall. So we're not going to be precise on the quarterly profile. Beyond 2025, I think from our perspective at this point, we'd like to see where tariffs stabilize, we'd like to obviously assess what moves can we make over time that we'll assess. So we'll get into what the impact may be in 2026, I think when we get through that process.
Travis Steed: Okay. And then a follow-up on the capital environment. Just it sounds like you kind of called out at the risk, but you're not seeing it yet. Just trying to think about how this compares to like 2022 when you saw it in the funnel versus kind of what you're seeing in the capital environment at this point?
Jamie Samath: Yes. I'd say through Q1, if you look at the U.S., what we've seen is strong customer response to da Vinci 5. I think the capital environment has been relatively strong for U.S. Customers there are using our leasing and user-based arrangements. So that allows them, to some extent, avoid kind of their formal capital budgets, gives them some flexibility to expand their programs. In OUS markets, as we described in prepared remarks, you see some markets where they're getting constrained by government budgets. That's either to do with kind of the elimination of post COVID funding or it reflects governments reprioritizing funding to other areas. For example, in Europe, you see some funding that moves towards military spending. So some pressures there. I think our focus in a situation like that is to first help customers increase utilization where they have the existing capacity and can have greater throughput through their assets than we have Genesis resources and other teams that can help them do that. We also have a growing set of economic capabilities, tools that we can help customers understand what the returns of those programs are. That's a growing part of our toolkit internationally. And then we look to expand what we've seen in the U.S. with respect to use of leasing and usage-based arrangements, which are at earlier stages of adoption with our customers there. In terms of what customers have said to us, we've had questions about tariffs and the environment. I don't think that's shown up yet in terms of core capital demand. But I think we're flagging that could have an impact. And certainly, to the extent that our customers' hospitals see increased pricing as a derivative effect of tariffs, then that creates pressure for them.
Travis Steed: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Jamie, a follow-up on tariffs. Just on the - did I hear you say that you're including the European reciprocal tariffs, which I think are 20% in 90 days assumed in that 1.7%. And Jamie, how should we think about your ability to mitigate the tariffs? Just maybe flesh that out a little bit more for us and how quickly you might be able to do that. I had one follow-up.
Jamie Samath: Yes. We are assuming in the 1.7% estimate for 2025 that the retaliatory tariffs go into effect once the 90-day pause period has elapsed. Obviously, we'll see how that plays out, but we've reflected that in the 1.7%. With respect to the manufacturing operations in our supply chain to the extent that there are low-hanging fruit that isn't disruptive to our partners and our employees, then, of course, we'll pursue those. But I think our first move is to let things stabilize and evaluate then what's possible. We'll do that concurrently across the year, and we will consider things like, do you have to invest to mitigate what's the time to receive the benefit, what's the economic return of that. And there are complexities in some of the things that you might do from an operational perspective. And so we don't want to move too quickly, given how dynamic the environment is.
Larry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And just for my follow-up, Jamie, on da Vinci 5, it looks like da Vinci 5 placements as a percent of U.S. placements actually was lower in Q1 from Q4. Hopefully, I'm not doing the math wrong. Why would da Vinci 5 placements in the U.S. as a percent decline in Q4? And how should we think about the ramp going forward? Thank you.
Jamie Samath: I believe, Brandon, correct me, I believe dV5 placements as a percent of total in the U.S. was higher in Q1 than Q4. But if I look at Q1 capital performance, supply for da Vinci 5 was where we expected it to be. And with respect to placement performance for all of the models, including da Vinci 5, I'd characterize it as normal seasonality, no concerns there for us.
Larry Biegelsen: All right. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your question, please.
Robbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe on the first one, the procedure volume was excellent in first quarter, and it's rare to see such a big raise after just one quarter. You touched on it in the prepared remarks, but maybe you could spend a little more time walking through what gave you the confidence to raise this early in the year? Yes, I'll just leave it there, and I have a follow-up question. Thanks.
Jamie Samath: Yes. We routinely have a process where we obviously, like many companies construct a forecast that reflects customer input. We look at, obviously, our plans and that - that guidance is a function of that routine process. Day adjusted Q1 procedure performance was 18.5%. I think that gives us a little bit of momentum into the rest of the year. Obviously, we're watching the macro carefully. If you look at the low end of the range of 15%, that would say the rest of the year would have to be 14% procedure growth. And so I think we have a decent range for kind of our bottoms-up process.
Gary Guthart: Just some anecdotes back from the road, and Dave has been out front of the customer, too. I think we're perceived as part of the solution, not part of the problem. I think that customers continue to adopt I think to see the economic benefits and the patient and outcome benefits. So, so far, so good.
Robbie Marcus: Great. And sorry to harp on it, but tariffs are a big focus, unfortunately, in everybody's world right now. Just to follow-up on Larry's question. It feels like you're taking a worst-case approach here where you're putting all the negatives and there aren't a lot of offsets or any built into the guide. You talked about maybe evaluating where you are at the end of the year. What are some of the potential levers you have to offset this? And how meaningful can they be? And when do you think we might be able to see some offsets if you do choose to do that? Thanks.
Jamie Samath: I'd just say on the philosophy on the tariff guide, from our perspective, we're playing it straight down the middle. It’s tariffs that are in effect all that have been announced. And we felt like that was the most responsible way to go with respect to what we guided. We didn't want to predict what may or may not change. And so we guided under that kind of a philosophy. In terms of potential mitigating operational activities for which we said we didn't expect a beneficial impact in 2025, maybe I'll let Dave touch on what some of those may be.
David Rosa: Yes, sure. Happy to. Hi Robbie. Some of the mitigations that we're considering on our side, if you look at our supply chain, they are - Jamie mentioned a little bit of it, but it's really two frames of reference that you ought to use. One is thinking about the parts that are coming into our factories, the ones that we assemble and then the other frame of reference are the parts that are leaving our factories. And so as we look about how do we optimize within those two frames of reference on the parts coming into our factories, our teams have been working to get to industrial scale for years now. And so some of the processes that exist within this framework with inside of Intuitive, really center around assessing risk in all of our supply chain. We procure thousands of parts for our systems and instruments. And so our teams look through there, assess the risk and then ensure appropriate mitigations are in place. And mitigations there can include dual sourcing. They can include strategic reserves. And so that's for a robust process that runs on a daily basis here for parts coming in. If you look about our parts, our components and our products going to customers, here, we've done a lot of work to qualify some of our products under USMCA. We've optimized inventory around the globe has some of these tariffs ahead of some of these tariffs taking place. And then if you look in the mid-term, we can use our existing manufacturing footprint that we have around the globe and optimize what products are factored in what area around the globe to help optimize some of the supply for our customers. And then in the long-term, we can build our overall manufacturing footprint against the trade environment that ultimately stabilizes. And so that's going to be a long-term way in which we help mitigate some of the supply risk, if you will, within our supply chains.
Robbie Marcus: Great. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Your question please.
Rick Wise: Good afternoon, everybody. I thought maybe just to change the focus briefly. OUS growth was particularly robust at 24%. Maybe you can talk about the drivers there, the sustainability of the drivers, the key markets and just what you've assumed in coming up with your new forecast as well?
Jamie Samath: Yes. We saw solid procedure growth in the U.S. of 13% and obviously, day adjusted is a little higher than that. I do think that we are seeing a relatively significant benefit from the adoption of da Vinci 5 in the U.S. I think customer response has been quite positive. You're generally seeing higher...
Gary Guthart: It was - he was asking OUS...
Jamie Samath: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Rick, you're going to have ask your question again, I missed it.
Rick Wise: Just the - Jamie, just big - just talking about the OUS growth, the international growth at 24%. It was particularly strong I thought and just drivers there and key drivers and the sustainability of those drivers into the rest of the year and beyond.
Jamie Samath: Yes. Sorry. Rick, you're talking about the 24% procedure growth for OUS.
Rick Wise: Exactly.
Jamie Samath: Yes. So you see some maybe earlier stage markets for us doing quite well. India, smaller market; Taiwan, those are starting to grow at really nice rates. I think we see our teams making real progress with respect to engagements with - key opinion leaders with surgical societies and adoption across a broader set of procedures. I think that's going well. Same in Taiwan. We benefited from some incremental reimbursements in Taiwan. Across Europe, you see relatively solid growth that progresses each quarter. U.K. kind of leads that growth. And in the U.K., they're seeing real value with respect to resource consumption savings addressing waiting list in the U.K. And then we've been actually kind of placing capital in distributor markets a little bit of a higher rate over the last several quarters, and we're seeing that create capacity for procedure growth. So I think that those elements all look good for us. I think that the watch out for us is to the extent that in Germany, Japan, U.K., ongoing capacity constraints for capital continues then at some point that starts to limit procedure growth. We have room to grow with respect to utilization there. And so that's what we'll pursue to the extent they're constrained. If you look at our long-term OUS procedure growth, it's been in the 20s for a long period of time. We're at early stages of adoption. And I think we feel quite good about how our teams are performing there. There are particular markets where you have unique dynamics like China.
Rick Wise: Got you. And just a follow-up. You've highlighted recently that increased customer interest in two areas. And it went by too quickly, I missed what you said about after hours surgery growth. I just didn't get the number. But after hours surgery and you recently hired a new leader for the cardiac surgery area, can you update us on these two areas? And where are you in sort of pursuing them? What's next? And again, maybe just talk about the growth outlook, if you would. Thank you.
David Rosa: Sure. Hi Rick. So, the two areas that you mentioned after hours and cardiac. On the after-hour side, this really is being driven by customers who want to provide equal access to high-quality minimally-invasive surgery to those patients who are so-called after hours and having it be the same as the patients who are entering the hospital during the day. And so that has been the primary sort of motivation behind it. And the ability for our customers to access capital for our teams to train the after-hours care teams are just parts or components to the equation that enable customers to access systems to have the right trained teams to support the surgeons who are delivering that care after hours. And so, these would be patients who are generally coming in with sort of emergent condition. And oftentimes, those teams for treating those patients, they offer some kind - generally some laparoscopic and minimally-invasive surgery, oftentimes a lot of open surgery. And so, the ability to have da Vinci as an option there is meaningful to the outcomes of those programs. On the cardiac side, the way that I kind of think about it is, for many years, the interventional side of cardiac intervention, so structural heart and other components from interventional cardiologists have been on the rise and you've seen them offer great outcomes to patients. And we've gone to the point now where I think there's also a set of patients where high-quality, minimally-invasive surgery is great and the best option for them. And so, we're at the point now where we think the technology with DV5 and other parts of our ecosystem, our work with societies, our work with academic institutions and with surgeons who have been doing this around the world, it's the right time for this investment. It's been growing year-over-year off of a small base and so the need is there. There is patient benefit that is there. And so, we'll line up these investments and continue our journey here for cardiac.
Rick Wise: Thanks Dave.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Maeder from Piper Sandler. Your question please.
Adam Maeder: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I'll keep it to one multipart question on force feedback technology. So, I guess the first question is, can you just maybe give us a little bit more color around the percentage of DV5 cases that are using force sensing instruments today? Remind us the portfolio, how many instruments have this technology, how can that evolve going forward? And then lastly, I saw there was a post-market study. I think it was 200 patients posted to clinicaltrials.gov, evaluating force feedback instruments. So, just maybe flesh out the clinical strategy going forward to validate this exciting technology? Thank you.
Jamie Samath: Sure. So, on the force feedback on the number of instruments that currently have the capability enabled that we have six different instruments that were chosen for their - what they do inside the procedure. And so we're looking at components of the procedure that we think would best benefit from force feedback technology. So that's how those instruments were chosen. In terms of how many today, how many cases are using force feedback. I don't have the number in front of me. There are many thousands of cases that are being done with force feedback, but I don't know the exact number. And when you look forward, I think what you're going to see is like any technology that's being studied you'll see these early single institution studies that we referenced. And that's where a single surgeon or a group of surgeons can study their results and look at it - look at it within their own institution and against their own data. And then as you look out, you'll start to see cross institute studies. In Intuitive and perhaps other investigators will put together larger studies that will include more patients that could be the one at clinical trials, that you're referencing. But it's a steady progression of data starting from the small and getting to the larger more statistically relevant studies. And that's when we'll be able to see what force feedback means at scale.
Gary Guthart: Two comments I'd make here. One is, so far, we're seeing hypothesis that drove the inclusion of force sensing instruments and force feedback technologies start to bear out, better learning for younger surgeons and the right force at the right time during the procedure as being linked to outcome. As you said, those are hypotheses that will be tested over time, but we're going to start seeing those studies progress. On the point of prevalence, how much is being used, just remember, a couple of things. One is force sensing and non-force sensing instruments can be used on dV5. So Gen 4 instruments can also be used on dV5. And we're supply constrained on force-sensing instruments. So we're not able to meet demand yet. Now we're working hard on that, both from lives in the instrumentation and the manufacturing capacity. So that's coming. But right now, the answer to what fraction are being used, that's an artificial limitation imposed by our manufacturing constraint.
Jamie Samath: Next question, please.
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman from BTIG. Your question, please.
Ryan Zimmerman: Thanks for taking the question. I'll stick to one in the interest of time. There's been a lot of discussion on Medicaid cuts and the impact to patients. I don't know, Dave, if you've quantified this or you're willing to put it out there, but I'm going to ask anyway, which is if you were to characterize the payer mix, particularly within the Medicaid population, what you could or could not be exposed to? And what potentially that impact would be as the government kind of considers this as option? I'd appreciate your thoughts there.
Jamie Samath: I'd just say it's a healthy mix between private and Medicare depending on the marketplace. I think I'd say it's too early for us to give any specific comments we obviously have discussions with customers. I think much of that is speculation as to how it may play out. But I think it's too early for us to comment, frankly.
Gary Guthart: Yes. This one on Medicaid, in particular, impact on Medicaid, right, versus Medicare? I think it was...it was...
Ryan Zimmerman: Yes, that's correct, Gary. Yes. I guess if it were to be amended, what kind of impact would utilization potentially have, particularly for robotics.
Gary Guthart: Yes. The team has done a little bit of a back of the envelope. I think it's too soon to speculate what that might be. It's not a dominant part of the mix. It's in our procedure mix, Medicaid, but it is not dominant. What that looks like too soon to say.
Ryan Zimmerman: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
David Roman: Thank you and good afternoon. I wanted just to continue along the thread of potential Medicaid cuts to hospitals. And maybe, Gary, you could expand a little bit on the comment made earlier about Intuitive being potentially part of the solution and not part of the problem. In contrast to kind of the comments that Jamie made or in conjunction with the comments Jamie made about a potentially worsening hospital CapEx environment and some of the factors we need to consider given the external environment?
Gary Guthart: Yes. Thank you for that. I think it's a great question. Why don't I think we're a part of the solution and just back from the road? And I think for a well-run program, total cost to treat per patient episode is outstanding, as good as any approach often better, certainly better than open and often better than lap. So I think if hospitals look out at this and say, look, we're going to provide care. This issue - I'm just - one thing they can do is stop giving care. Well, that's a train rank. So their mission is to provide care. If they have a well-run program, they both get better outcomes, higher physician and surgeon satisfaction and patient satisfaction and lowest total cost to treat in their hands. So of course, there's a whole bunch of different procedures and a whole bunch of different hospitals, but in aggregate, that's a true statement. So they want to do it. And if they do it, they do better economically. But you have this issue of stress on capital, particularly in some U.S. markets. And the reason that, that stress for them is that the budgets, the operating budgets are not always held by the same budget holder, as the capital budget. So, the operating person is saying, this is going great. I'm getting really nice returns, but the capital person is being incented by other means. And so Jamie had said in the prepared remarks and he was right, the first thing to do is help them with utilization. And we will. That's what our genesis teams do. We're happy to help them with analytical tools so they really understand their total cost to treat and what the probability of those programs are. At the same time, if ultimately they need additional capital, that's part the conversation with the other side of the insurance house, which is the one that controls the capital budget. Therein lies some of the stress. So early on, it's go help them with utilization. Sometimes we can help them with workflow management and also move machines around move systems where they need to. You've seen us do that in our history, back in the day. But in general, I think in many of these economies in many of these countries, high-quality minimally invasive care as provided by da Vinci systems and the like has been fantastic for them. They want to do more or less. Okay. We are - at our last question, thank you for the questions. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed it quintuple aims better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, lower total cost of care; and finally, increased access to care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs in their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-23 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q4 2024 Intuitive Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Brandon Lamm, Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical.
Brandon Lamm: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; Jamie Samath, our CFO; Daniel Oh, our Senior Medical Officer. Dave Rosa, our President and regular participant on this call, is away from the office this week on a prior business commitment and will not be joining today. Dr. Daniel Oh, Senior Medical Officer and practicing surgeon, will join us on this call to describe clinical highlights. We would also like to announce that Dan Connolly will be joining Intuitive as our VP and Head of Investor Relations. Dan has worked at a global investment manager for the last 18 years and has actively followed surgical robotics since 2008. We look forward to Dan joining Intuitive in early February. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our full year and fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results and procedure highlights. Dan will present clinical highlights. Then, I will provide our financial outlook for 2025. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. I'll touch on our performance for the full year 2024 and share our perspective going into 2025. 2024 was a strong year for Intuitive with robust early adoption of our fifth generation multi-port platform, da Vinci 5 and healthy procedure growth in many of our supported indications and countries, resulting in strong financial performance for the year. Adoption of our Ion and da Vinci SP platforms continued with new global clearances and increased utilization. Our teams have been hard at work launching da Vinci 5 and learning from its early experience. We are improving our products across all three of our platforms and helping our customers achieve their programmatic objectives. We started 2024 focused on four main thrusts. First, we expanded indications and launches of our new platforms by region with a particular focus on our first phase of da Vinci 5 launch. Second, we pursued increased adoption for focused procedures by country through training, commercial activities and market access efforts. Third, we drove quality and gross margin improvements in our global operations. And finally, we focused on increasing our productivity, particularly in functions that benefit from industrial scale. Taken together, our team made excellent progress against these objectives. Moving to procedures, growth for the full year was 17%. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States and regional performance in countries including the UK and Ireland, Japan and Germany. Distribution markets including Brazil, Spain and Italy were also strong in the year. This week, we announced the acquisition from ab medica of the da Vinci business in Italy, Spain, Portugal and related territories. We're pleased with their performance and we look forward to welcoming these new staff to our team. In the US, general surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy with foregut and appendectomy procedures rising as well. Thoracic procedure growth was also healthy in the year. Bariatric procedures fell modestly for the full year 2024 given the rise in GLP-1 medications. Procedure growth outside the United States continued to diversify beyond urology, with nice growth in categories including general surgery and thoracic surgery. Globally, benign indications grew approximately 200 basis points faster in the year than cancer indications. In flexible robotics, ion procedures showed continued strength with 78% growth for the full year. SP procedure growth accelerated in the year with 72% growth over a full year, a result of healthy growth in Korea, Japan, and Europe, and solid growth in the US. On the capital front, we placed 1430 multi-port systems in the full year 2024 compared with 1313 multi-port systems in 2023. Ion placements for the full year were 271 versus 213 prior year and SP placements were 96 for the full year versus 57 systems in the prior year. Globally, placements were strong in the United States, helped by the launch of da Vinci 5. Overall, our systems portfolio of da Vinci 5, da Vinci Xi, da Vinci X, da Vinci SP and Ion combined with our flexible financing options allows our team to meet our customers' varying needs. Jamie will take you through placement dynamics in more detail later in the call. System utilization remains an important indicator of customer health because it is correlated to patient demand, care team satisfaction and hospital financial health. Multi-port utilization grew 3% in the year, SP utilization grew 12% in the year and Ion utilization grew 13%. Given our different platforms, their procedure mix and sites of care, teasing apart system utilization by customer segment becomes increasingly important going forward. For example, a midsized community hospital lung program systems utilization can differ from a high-volume community hospital general surgery program. As robot assisted surgery moves to the back half of adoption curves in some procedures, utilization growth rates may differ from prior year trends. Our performance supported revenue of $8.4 billion for the year, of which 84% was recurring and representing 17% growth over 2023. Our operating expenses were at the lower end of our spend guidance. Our spending reflects three initiatives. First, we continue to invest in R&D to support innovation and adoption of our platforms and digital tools globally. Second, we're expanding our manufacturing and commercial footprints. And lastly, we have sought to leverage our enabling functions given our increased scale. Our product margins also started to improve in the year, as increased shipment volume allowed for better factory utilization, as well as leverage in our component, shipment and other logistics costs. Taken together, our net income grew by 29% in 2024 over 2023. Touching briefly on da Vinci 5, our teams have done a nice job in executing a complex launch. We placed 362 da Vinci 5s in the year and over 2,500 surgeons have performed in total over 32,000 procedures on da Vinci 5 in 2024. da Vinci 5 has broad clinical indications and over 40 different procedure types have been performed using da Vinci 5 today. We design our systems to allow for routine sequential upgrades to their capability over time and da Vinci 5 customers will receive hardware and software upgrades going forward starting this year. This year's upgrades will focus on digital features supported by our 10,000-time increase in computing power. We'll share more details on these features as we bring them to market. As we enter 2025, our company priorities are as follows. First, we will focus on the full launch of da Vinci 5, its regional clearances and follow-on feature releases. Second, we'll pursue increased adoption for our focus procedures by country through training, commercial activities, and market access efforts. Third, we'll drive continued progress in building industrial scale, product quality, and manufacturing optimization. And finally, we'll focus on excellence and availability of our digital tools. Jamie, over to you.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, and will also summarize our GAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2024 revenue procedures and system placements are in line with our preliminary press release of January 15. I will briefly review full year 2024 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail. 2024 financial performance was strong. Da Vinci procedures and total revenue each grew 17% over the prior year. Pro forma gross margin improved 100 basis points to 69.1% and pro forma SG&A expenses leveraged as compared to 2023. As a result, pro forma operating margin for 2024 improved 310 basis points to 37%, and pro forma EPS increased 28%, building off of the 22% increase in 2023. We placed 362 da Vinci 5 systems in our first year of the limited launch, of which 174 systems were placed in Q4, including our first replacements of da Vinci 5 in Korea. Turning to Q4. Our financial performance was ahead of our expectations, driven by revenue growth of 25% and strength across the rest of the P&L, resulting in pro forma operating margin of 38%. Q4 revenue reflected a couple of favorable dynamics. First, a higher purchase mix of systems as compared to recent periods, driven by multisystem deals with certain US IDNs that prefer to purchase and a higher mix of placements through distributors. Second, we saw a higher mix of dual console placements for da Vinci 5 as we increase supply and were able to support more academic customers. And finally, we saw a higher system ASP, resulting from a stronger mix of da Vinci 5 placements. Underlying core metrics were also strong with da Vinci procedure growth of 18%, growth in the installed base of da Vinci Systems of 15%, and average system utilization growth of 3%. In Q4, US procedures grew 15%, driven by growth in benign general surgery, including accretive growth in procedures performed after hours for emerging care. Bariatric procedures in the US declined in the low to mid-single-digit range, similar to last quarter. OUS procedures grew 25%, driven by relative strength in India, the UK, Italy and Japan. Procedure growth in Korea improved sequentially, in part driven by strong SP growth. However, our business there continues to be impacted by physician strikes. Consistent with the last couple of quarters, procedure growth in China was slightly below the corporate average, reflecting a continuation of the dynamics we have described on previous calls. Looking at OUS procedure performance in aggregate, we see strong growth in colorectal, benign general surgery and thoracic categories. Reviewing capital performance. We placed 493 systems in the fourth quarter, 19% higher than the 415 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year. In the US, we placed 284 systems in Q4, an increase of 75 systems as compared to last year, reflecting several large multisystem placements with a number of IDNs and an increase in the supply of da Vinci 5. Outside the US, we placed 209 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 206 in the same quarter last year. This quarter, we placed 89 systems in Europe, 43 in Japan, and 20 in China, compared with 71 in Europe, 70 in Japan and 11 in China in Q4 of last year. Placements in the UK and Germany continue to be impacted by ongoing government budget pressures affecting health care capital spending. The 89 system placements in Europe included 39 systems into markets served by our distributors as compared to 24 systems last year. In Japan, financial pressures caused some customers to delay capital investment decisions. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.41 billion, a 25% increase over last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 26%. Systems revenue grew 36% year-over-year, driven by a 19% increase in da Vinci system placements, a higher system ASP and the higher purchase mix previously referenced. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Leasing represented 45% of Q4 placements, compared with 58% last quarter, driven by the aforementioned mix of system placements from certain IDNs in the US who prefer to purchase and a higher mix of placements with our distributors. However, as we look forward, we continue to expect that leasing rates will increase over time. Q4 system average selling prices were $1.59 million, as compared to $1.42 million last year driven by higher mix of da Vinci 5 and a higher dual-console mix, partially offset by lower pricing in China. We recognized $28 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter, compared with $21 million last year. Da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,860, compared with approximately $1,800 last year. The year-over-year increase in I&A per procedure reflects customer buying patterns and a higher mix of SP procedures, partially offset by procedure mix in the US given a lower mix of bariatric procedures and a higher mix of cholecystectomy. Turning to Ion. There were approximately 28,000 Ion procedures performed in the fourth quarter, an increase of 70% as compared to last year. In Q4, we placed 69 Ion systems compared to 44 in Q4 of 2023. As a reminder, supply constraints impacted Ion system placements in the fourth quarter of last year. Seven of the 69 systems were placed in OUS markets. The installed base of Ion systems increased 51% from last year to 805 systems and average system utilization increased 13% year-over-year. Fourth quarter SP procedure growth continued to accelerate, growing 81%, driven by Korea and early-stage growth in Europe and Japan, where we have clearance for a broad set of indications. We placed 30 SP systems in Q4 and 96 for the year, up from 57 placements in 2023. Fourth quarter placements included seven in Korea, six in Europe and four in Japan. Average system utilization for our SP platform grew 18% in Q4, reflecting in part growth of SP in markets where we have a broad set of indications. We have received recent clearances in the US for thoracic and colorectal indications. However, we expect broad commercial efforts for SP in those procedure categories to commence once we obtain FDA clearance for a SP stapler. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 69.5%, compared with 68% for the fourth quarter of 2023. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin reflects fixed overhead leverage given revenue growth, lower inventory reserves and improvements in freight and logistics costs. In 2024, we executed on our plans to significantly improve product margins for our Ion and SP platforms. While we have made substantial progress, Ion and SP product margins continue to be dilutive and our teams have ongoing programs to deliver further improvement. With respect to our manufacturing expansion and capital investment plans, in 2025, we anticipate opening new facilities the da Vinci 5 and Ion system manufacturing in California and new endoscope manufacturing facilities in Germany and Bulgaria. As a result, and as we have previously indicated, we expect a significant increase in depreciation expense in 2025. We will also continue to transfer mature products to facilities in Peachtree Corners, Georgia, and Mexicali. Given these activities, we expect elevated inventory levels during 2025. As we complete this cycle of manufacturing expansion that is driven by our strategy to operate at industrial scale, we anticipate lower levels of capital expenditures in 2025 and 2026 as compared to recent periods. Fourth quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 9% compared with last year, driven by increased headcount, higher variable compensation and increased legal expenses. Fourth quarter 2024 operating expenses included a $45 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation, as compared to a $40 million contribution in Q4 of last year. Looking at operating expenses for the year, we delivered on planned leverage in SG&A, which improved by 180 basis points as a percentage of revenue. While we will continue to look for opportunities within SG&A to leverage as we grow, we would highlight that in 2025, we expect increased depreciation expenses given recent capital expenditures and higher legal expenses given ongoing litigation. Innovation continues to be critical to helping our customers make progress in the quintuple aim and therefore you should expect us to prioritize investments in R&D. Pro forma other income was $87.6 million for Q4, lower than $94.6 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by FX remeasurement of the balance sheet. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.5%, a little lower than our expectations, reflecting net discrete benefits of $11 million related to statute of limitation expirations and other adjustments to certain tax items. Fourth quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $805 million, or $2.21 per share, compared with $574 million or $1.60 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $686 million, or $1.88 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $606 million, or $1.69 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2023 GAAP tax expense reflected onetime benefits of $159 million related to an increase in deferred tax assets associated with the statutory rate increase in Switzerland and receipt of certain tax benefits related to our Swiss operations. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. We ended the year with cash and investments of $8.8 billion, compared with $8.3 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by capital expenditures of $312 million. With respect to the plans we announced on Tuesday to go direct in Italy, Spain, Portugal and associated territories, the base purchase price is EUR290 million with an earn-out of up to an additional EUR31 million based on 2025 procedure volumes. While our primary motivation is to develop closer relationships with customers serving a combined population of approximately 118 million people, we do expect this transaction, which we estimate to close in the first half of 2026, to be slightly accretive to pro forma EPS. Before I turn it over to Dan to discuss clinical highlights, let me address the outlook for pro forma operating margins for 2025. Q4 performance of 38% was above our expectations. Looking ahead to 2025, we anticipate pro forma operating margins in 2025 to be lower than Q4 due to several dynamics. First, as previously stated, leasing rates are expected to be higher than Q4, which results in revenue and profits for related system placements to be recorded over multiple years versus in the quarter of placement. Second, we anticipate significantly higher depreciation expense given recent capital expenditures. And finally, we expect a higher mix of da Vinci 5, Ion and SP revenue, which carry product margins below the corporate average. In addition, from a modeling perspective, I would also highlight a couple of additional considerations. First, revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represents approximately 25% of our total revenue. On a revenue-weighted basis, using current exchange rates, the US dollar is approximately 4% stronger than rates realized in Q4. Second, as we move into broad launch of da Vinci 5 in the middle of the year and customers have the opportunity to upgrade their fleets, we would expect trading credits for [Xi] (ph) to be significantly higher than recent periods adversely impacting system ASPs. Finally, given the increasing choice customers have, as competitors bring robotic systems to the market and seek geographical clearances, we may see capital selling cycles lengthen as customers evaluate alternatives. Brandon will provide our outlook for 2025 later in this call. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Dan.
Daniel Oh: Thank you, Jamie. I'd like to share with you some recently published peer review literature that we found to be notable. In addition to the specific data highlighted on this call, we encourage you to consider the wide body of evidence detailing these topics in published scientific studies over the years. Today, we'll give an update on two recent publications. In the first study, Dr. Rocco Ricciardi and colleagues from the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston collaborated with the research team at Intuitive for the COMPARE Study published in the Annals of Surgery. This landmark study compared perioperative outcomes of da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery, to laparoscopic or thoracoscopic surgery, as well as to open procedures. This was a meta-analysis, which analyzes results from previously published evidence over time to obtain an overview of cumulative data. In this study, the investigators pull data from randomized controlled trials, prospective comparative cohort studies and large real-world evidence database studies from the past 12 years. In order to evaluate whether da Vinci procedures were associated with an improvement in short-term patient outcomes across seven commonly performed oncologic procedures from different specialties. Notably, over 1 million patients were included in each of the da Vinci, laparoscopic thoracoscopic and open patient groups, and included data from 22 countries. The authors found that compared to standard minimally invasive surgery, patients undergoing da Vinci procedures had favorable perioperative outcomes. Specifically, da Vinci patients had a 56% lower chance of conversion to open, 21% lower chance of receiving a blood transfusion, and 10% less likelihood to experience a complication within 30 days of the procedure. In addition, length of stay was significantly shorter with lower 30-day readmission and mortality rates. Similar favorable outcomes were found for da Vinci patients when compared to the open approach with even greater magnitude differences between the two approaches. The authors concluded that this meta analysis demonstrated multiple benefits for da Vinci procedures when compared to alternative minimally invasive or open approaches, noting that these results will be helpful to decision makers considering the use of robotics in multi-specialty settings. In the second study, Dr. Michael Awad from Washington University School of Medicine and other colleagues published in Surgical Endoscopy the results of a preclinical study using Intuitive's novel force feedback technology incorporated in da Vinci 5. Across 28 surgeons with varying levels of experience, this study evaluated the forces applied to tissue when having force feedback technology on or off during core surgical tests, including retraction, dissection and suturing in a tissue model. Results from this study demonstrated a significant reduction in both the average and maximum forces exerted on tissue for all three surgical tests, irrespective of surgeon experience levels. Notably, when using the highest sensitivity setting, up to a 55% reduction of the maximum force exerted on tissue during suturing was observed. The authors concluded that this study demonstrated that force feedback technology may significantly decrease the forces applied at the tissue level when performing common surgical tests across novice, intermediates and experienced surgeons. They continue to note, this innovative technology has the potential to enable safer and gentler surgeries, resulting in better surgical outcomes for patients undergoing robotic-assisted surgery. To me, the notable finding in this study is that the benefit of force feedback was observed not just in novice surgeons, which one might expect, but also in experienced surgeons who had completed at least 200 da Vinci procedures. Now, I'll turn it over to Brandon.
Brandon Lamm: Thank you, Dan. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2025. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement earlier this month, total 2024 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 17% year-over-year to over 2,680,000 procedures performed worldwide. For 2025, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 13% and 16%. The low end of the range assumes growth in China continues to be impacted by environmental and competitive dynamics. European governments continue to constrain hospital CapEx budgets limiting the expansion of capacity in the field and bariatric procedure declines continue at rates similar to 2024. At the high end, we assume China procedure growth recovers relative to 2024, the CapEx environment improves in Europe and bariatric procedure declines moderate. Q1 and full year 2025 will have approximately one fewer working day in 2024 due to the leap year. Turning to gross profit. In 2024, our pro forma gross profit margin was 69%. In 2025, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 67% and 68% of net revenue. The lower estimate of pro forma gross profit margin in 2025 reflects significant incremental depreciation as we bring on new facilities, the impact of growth in newer products and the impact of the stronger US dollar. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and pricing. The range does not include any potential impact of new tariffs on our business, which could be material. Turning to operating expenses. In 2024, our pro forma operating expenses grew 10%. In 2025, we expect our pro forma operating expense growth to be within a range of 10% and 15%. The growth in operating expenses reflects increased depreciation from new facilities, investments in innovation to drive our growth objectives, and an increase in legal expenses. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $760 million and $790 million in 2025. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $370 million and $400 million in 2025. With regard to capital expenditures, we expect the range to total between $650 million and $800 million, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, in 2024, our pro forma income tax rate was 21.4%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2025 pro forma income tax rate to be within a range of 22% and 23% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really strong finish to the year. One for Gary, one for Jamie. So, Gary, historically, you said procedures drive placements. In the second half of '24, US system placements grew over 35%. Utilization was about 2%. Is this a leading indicator of more procedures? Or will we have a digestion period to restore normal utilization? And I have one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I think a couple of things are going on there. One of them is the -- as I said in the prepared remarks, as we get to the back half of some curves, the expectations of some of those programs may be different in terms of utilization as they participate. In other words, not every account is going to be a high-volume account. And I think that's okay. I think the economics can work and I think we can supply them. So some of that is going on. I think the other thing is new capital opportunities. New capital features can pull forward or otherwise have people delay a little bit and then acquire systems that can put a wave or a ripple through utilization. And we're just going to have to see if that ripple plays through. So both of those effects are likely going on. It is actually extremely hard analytically to tease them out. I think in the US, over time, you're going to see utilization growth rates in multiport start to settle a little bit. I don't think they'll keep galloping. At the same time, I think SP utilization has room to run and Ion utilization has room to run.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks, Gary. And Jamie, on the Q3 call, you said the gross margin will be a little lower in 2025 versus 2024. I think the 67% to 68% guidance was probably a little bit lower than expected. Can you quantify the drivers from the 69.1% this year in 2024 to the 67% to 68%? And how to think about the path back to your goal of 70%? Thank you.
Jamie Samath: Yeah. There's really three drivers, Larry, the largest of which is the impact of depreciation expense and associated fixed costs. So there's deleverage in the '24 to '25 comparison, roughly-ish, depending on [weight] (ph), you have the revenue model for ’25. That's about a point of the 160-point delta, if you go from ‘24 actual to a midpoint of ‘25. The other two dynamics roughly equalish in terms of impact are product mix with DV5, Ion and SP being a greater proportion of the revenue, they all carry currently margins below the corporate average, so have a dilutive effect from a mix perspective. And then I think what's new from the last call is the impact of FX. So those three things are the drivers. There are some offsetting cost reductions. The teams are delivering within that kind of gross margin range. I think what we've said with respect to gross margin is over the midterm, we think we can get back beyond 70%. That is going to require us, once we get past this kind of incremental depreciation to leverage over a multiyear period as we grow. We also have, as we've said, the work on product margins in Ion and SP. There's still some work to be done there. And then on a more routine basis, our teams have to deliver cost downs.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks, Jamie.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Robbie Marcus: Okay, thank you. And I'll echo congratulations on a fantastic fourth quarter. Two for me. First, maybe for Gary, you gave a lot of detail on the call about a midyear full launch and trade-in cycle. Would love to just get your qualitative comments around how you're thinking about the mix of da Vinci 5 versus Xi going forward? The necessity or the speed of which an upgrade cycle can start? And how you're thinking about Xi versus da Vinci 5 placements in terms of mix going forward outside the US on approval start rolling in? It all has implications for the model, so I'd love to get your thoughts on that.
Gary Guthart: I was going to say -- I'll tell you a little bit about, I think, perhaps the environmental aspects of that kind of the wrapping around it, I'll turn it over to Jamie for any modeling implications. I just -- what goes -- two things are driving what we call broad launch. One of them is getting our supply chains up to scale and volume for what we expect. Demand could be when we start going out and looking at things like trade-ins and also starting to get clearances around the world. So that's exciting. The next one is software updates, and those software updates reflect both feedback from the field and then the integration of some of the technologies in our digital space from hub to some of the imaging things we can do that start to come out in the first set of launches, which is really great. I think those are digital tools that our customers and surgeons will appreciate, and starts giving them a lot of access to data that helps them analyze the performance of themselves and of their programs. How compelling that is, we'll determine how fast customers want to upgrade. I think the upgrade cycle comes down to this kind of question of differential value. X and Xi are outstanding machines. They are workhorses. They work really well. We're delighted to support them and support our customers who use them as they found the increasing value in the features and content we bring to da Vinci 5, whether it's analytics or force reflection or ergonomics or better imaging, then that drives the trade-in cycle. The question, and I understand your modeling question well of how fast does it all move and what does that look like? It can be difficult to predict. Jamie, I'd turn it over to you and let you add your commentary.
Jamie Samath: Yeah. While we don't have a specific percentage, the impact of moving to broad launch, the impact of getting additional geographical clearances, obviously then says, directionally, over time, the proportion of placements that are DV5 generally should increase. Although I would recognize that Xi is a capable system. And at some point, we have the opportunity for a refurbished Xi. With respect to trade-ins, you don't really see trading start to pick up until you get to broad launch, which is the middle of the year, and it's going to be a function of the dynamics that Gary indicated. Of course, we can look back at what happened on the Xi launch and how those upgrades went and we have some indication from customers in our pipelines. I think the best that we could say at this point, given it's so early is that any trading cycle would be progressive.
Gary Guthart: Final point I'll make, and I think you had asked, Robbie, the question is part of this is, is there an opportunity for depreciated assets like X and Xi, which are highly capable. We know how to service, and we know how to support or -- to those open or create other opportunities in other markets that may be more capital price sensitive and the answer to that is yes.
Robbie Marcus: Great. Maybe just one quick follow-up. Gary, you always give us a general state of the union on the health of the capital equipment environment around the world. US, OUS, and I'm particularly thinking of China where you had a really strong placement quarter and fourth quarter. So any thoughts there would be great as we head into 2025. Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I think Jamie usually does that. Jamie, why don't you take care of that?
Jamie Samath: I'd first say I don't think we characterized the 20 systems we placed in China in Q4 as strong. Maybe it is on a year-over-year comparison basis. But the environment in China continues to be dynamic and challenging as we've said, impacted by both domestic competition and a set of activities implemented by the government there. So I characterize the environment as relatively consistent and challenging. In terms of capital overall, I think in the US, it's been strong. Part of that is interest in da Vinci 5 given it's a new product. And you see, to some extent, less sensitivity to capital budgets given just the proportion of placements in the US in particular, the -- at least. We've highlighted the challenges in the UK and Germany. And new for us in Q4 for Japan was some delays because of the profitability in certain customers there. So I'd say we've seen relative strong -- strength in the US, some mix dynamics in the OUS markets. We don't really have enough tea leaves to predict how that plays out in '25.
Robbie Marcus: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America Securities. You may proceed.
Travis Steed: Hey, I’ll echo my congrats as well. Gary, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question. You're kind of crossing over $1 billion a year in R&D now and even after launching DV5. So maybe help us understand the R&D investment opportunity over the medium term and potentially moving into kind of new green spaces. Is that going to be more through the endoluminal platform or are there still chunky categories like cardio that could be minimal to robotics? Or is it more about geographic expansion side of care? Just thinking to understand kind of the true opportunity left out there to capture.
Gary Guthart: I think it's a mix of all three of the things you just described. I think there are innovations and technologies, some of which are extensions to platforms you know about, some of which are platforms that are years away and you don't know about that I think open new opportunities for us over time. And we're diligent about them. They take a while. They take some investment and they take [falls] (ph). There are existing platforms that could use additional indications, and those can be geographic, in which case, there's the regulatory and clinical work to secure those indications. And so we spend money on that and go do it. And then there's additional indications that come from things like additional instruments and accessories and imaging capabilities on existing platforms that if we develop them, we can bring to market and open the market for others. We also spent some money making sure that latecomers to robotics get what they need. It's not just that late comers just need time to simmer and sooner or later, they come find you. They sometimes have different needs, whether those needs or learning needs or economic needs. And it takes some work. And -- but we think that work is worth it. And some of the things you see in da Vinci 5 are those types of things. So short story is that we see opportunity in all of those buckets. We run a process that tries to balance those opportunities so that we're not totally overexposed to one or the other in [that instant] (ph). We have a multiyear horizon and a multi-specialty horizon and it's geographically mixed.
Travis Steed: Helpful. Thanks. And then, Jamie, maybe just a shorter-term OpEx question on the 10% to 15% growth, kind of the high and low end, how much of that's R&D versus SG&A? And any color there on how that can shape up and kind of what drives the high and low end? And potentially, since you did mention tariffs, just kind of curious how to size that or a potential way to mitigate that, if you can? Just wanted to kind of follow up on Larry's margin question. Thank you.
Jamie Samath: Yeah. With respect to how R&D and SG&A might grow, I'd characterize it as similarish in terms of -- for that 10% to 15%. Obviously, R&D is a priority, as we've stated. In SG&A, what you'll see is us add reps and commercial folks to support the procedure growth. We also have said that there'll be higher legal expenses in SG&A given ongoing litigation and a portion of the CapEx results and depreciation that goes into our SG&A expenses. And so they'll grow roughly-ish about the same rate. In terms of the range of 10% to 15%, most of that is driven by the procedure range, meaning, obviously, to some extent, we'll manage our expenses in accordance with how our business plays out. There are some opportunities for us to invest incrementally in R&D, but we'll do that as we make progress and achieve milestones. In terms of tariffs, obviously, we see a lot in the news where we're monitoring those events closely. We are internally evaluating what the impact of any potential tariff might be and therefore, how we might respond. We can say that the significant portion of our instruments are currently manufactured in Mexico. And so to the extent there are significant tariffs implemented there that could have a material impact for us. And of course, one response then that any company might consider is what would you do with pricing. Nothing that we've decided there. And obviously, we're balancing the needs of our customers and their objectives with the needs of our own business. So stay tuned is what I'd say.
Travis Steed: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. You may proceed.
Rick Wise: Thanks. Good afternoon. Gary, in your very thoughtful comments during the JPMorgan conference, I think you talked about new digital features that you should make today again said hardware and software digital features coming. I was hoping and I’m sure you're not ready to give us truly specifics on all these. But maybe help us understand what areas this -- in what way this might enhance da Vinci 5? Will it open up new procedures? Will it be about productivity? Will it be about -- will it enable you to use the da Vinci 5 in a different setting? How does this expand the vision or the possibilities of da Vinci 5 in the near term? And then I'll have a follow-up, if I could.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. In early thinking here, I just think of it in three categories. If we can make it easier to get great outcomes for more care teams by giving them tools in the OR, just real-time tools, we think that creates opportunities for them. I think it builds confidence. I think you get better care teams faster that way. And this kind of -- does that give you access to new procedures, I think the way to say that is it probably gives you access to more patients. Are they new procedure categories? Not always, but there are patients that become easier for those surgeons and care teams to reach because they're more confident to reach them. So can it help us that way? Yeah, I think it can. I think that's one set of categories. The next one is building confidence in care teams quickly is in everybody's best interest. It's great for the hospital. It gives them faster returns and higher confidence. It's great for the care teams. They build confidence and they get there faster. And I think a lot of our tools can help through that, can help accelerate learning, not just for the surgeon but for others. And then finally, I think a lot of these tools allow for value analysis by the customer using their own data in their own hands. And that, I think, builds confidence also and illuminates opportunity for them, and that helps them and it helps us. So for DV5 and kind of the space we're in right now, that's how you ought to think about it. One of the neat things that Lonnie used to say, and he's right is that every time you build a capability and then secure that, you have it, you understand it well, it opens a new door. Because a surgeon, like Dr. Oh here will take that new capability and start to explore with it. Where can it lead me? What can I do next? And I think some of the things that we're working on in DV5, some of the imaging and augmented reality things will start to inspire the next set of surgeons. And with that inspiration comes opportunity.
Rick Wise: Great. And if I could follow up briefly with Jamie. Jamie, obviously, Ion, SP both had terrific years last year. What accelerates -- what drives the next phase of growth there? And specifically, when is -- what level of sales or what has to happen? And is it a year or five away? When are these two excellent products no longer a margin drag? Thank you.
Jamie Samath: Yeah. In terms of the overall business, what's driving procedures and revenue. If I look at Ion with 28,000 procedures in Q4, you can see that's a run rate of over 100,000 procedures almost entirely in the US. So you're starting to get up the adoption curve in the US for Ion and a significant remaining portion is in transthoracic needle aspiration in terms of the approach versus bronchoscopic approaches in terms of where we've adopted in the early period. So what you see based on where you are in the adoption curve in the US for biopsy for Ion is customers will tend to more focus on improvements in utilization. And as you get to that point in the adoption curve, again, biopsy in the US, you just naturally on the next curve start to see procedure growth rates come down. And you've seen that if you look at the last three or four quarters. And so for our Ion business, kind of next set of focus, obviously, we've got to finish the US is the markets in which we're launching internationally with the clearance in Europe, Korea and China. And on a longer-term basis, there is the opportunity for Ion as a platform to get into new indications that would be in the lung first, and there's potential for other places in the body down the road. From a product cost perspective, it is a set of programs that take quite some time. It's the everyday battle in the manufacturing team and there is some engineering work that needs to happen to kind of get to the product cost. And I'd say that's also in the midterm, consistent with our overall gross margin objectives. With respect to SP adoption, again, we've also got international launches there. Europe and Japan, both have broad indications. You see Korea, which we've had in the marketplace for some time, really strong utilization. And so for SP, it's really as we look to the US, is the additional indications. We've got thoracic and colorectal. You have the opportunity to extend that over some period. You see the growth rate accelerating nicely in SP. Margin work in SP is, let's say, not the same level of effort as Ion because we're more leveraged. The social and vision console are common with Xi, but never less work to do. That is also, I characterize as something that happens over the midterm.
Rick Wise: Thank you, Gary.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
David Roman: Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. I wanted just to start with a comment you made in the prepared remarks regarding competition and selling cycles. Is this something that you're observing today as you talk to customers outside the US or even in the US? Or are you just calling out a theoretical impact of what might happen as new entrants come to market? And then I have one follow-up.
Jamie Samath: We have seen it clearly in China with the increasing number of domestic competitors there. I'd say that in terms of impact of competition to selling cycles in other international markets has been relatively stable. But what you're seeing is an increasing number of competitors get clearances in various markets, including in the US, there are a number of competitors in the US and obviously, there's one larger company that's looking to make a submission in [Technical Difficulty] So we're just acknowledging that as competition increases, there is the possibility outside of China, the selling cycles could lengthen.
David Roman: That's helpful. And maybe just kind of a segue on that one. As you think about the opportunity in instruments and accessories, either on a per procedure basis or a total addressable market basis, can you help us think through which parts of sort of the surgical ecosystem you've captured today? And maybe give us some sense of where that might be going over time? We understand that's the fourth sensing piece of the launch of -- with DV5 and how that might impact basically an upgraded instrument and corresponding ASP within that INA line. But as you look at kind of other parts of the surgical ecosystem that you could capture to further entrench yourself, can you help us understand what those might be and maybe size some of them and how kind of you think about that when kind of your marketing and strategic planning teams?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Maybe I'll start with kind of the principles we use to think about how we can bring additional value to procedures we already participate in. And underneath, I think you have a modeling question, and I'll let Jamie take that. On the principal side, we look around and say, if there's something going on in the operating room that our customers are currently spending on, they're buying from somebody else. And we think that either we have design capabilities or integration capabilities that would make for that experience to be better for them and value creating. It's either clinically value creating or it's economically value creating, then we'll seek to do that. Sometimes in partnership, [indiscernible] on table and sometimes it's something that we'll try to do ourselves take in-house and the way we've done some things like the cannula seals and stapling. So we look across it. If we see a real place that it's true value creation, not just something where it changes the revenue line by doing exactly what somebody else does, we're not very interested in that. But if we think the integration or the design creates a better outcome for the customer, either economically or clinically, hopefully both, then we'll step forward and we'll do that. We don't think we're done. If you look at da Vinci 5, you saw some things come into da Vinci 5 that were benefited by integration, and we think it's working great. So we look for those things. They take a while. They're not immediate. So our strategy and our product planners are looking for value creation opportunities there, but it doesn't start with how fast can the revenue growth be. It starts with what's the value creation and what could that be. Force sensing instruments, force reflecting instruments are such an example. They're more complex. They have a higher ASP. We think they bring value. We have to demonstrate that value and off we go. Jamie, I think the modeling question is super hard, but I'm going to give you a shot.
Jamie Samath: So, I would just say that the two examples I'd reference in terms of where you could, let's say, get greater share of wallet, if you can bring value, our force feedback instruments and insufflation both on da Vinci 5. Force feedback, we don't expect to be kind of at a broad supply until the end of '25. So the kind of impact that has on I&A per procedure is gated by when we get to broad supply with respect to inflation. So far, the proportion of cases that use that has been pretty high and that can have an impact as da Vinci 5 procedure volumes grow. I would just say if I zoom out in terms of I&A per procedure in total, the larger driver is going to be procedure mix. A greater proportion of kind of where we see growth coming from is in benign procedures. Gary kind of described that in more recent results. But when you think about cholecystectomy and other benign procedures, you'll have a procedure mix dynamic that means that we think, at least over the next couple of years, I&A per procedure drifts down slowly over time.
Gary Guthart: We have time for just one last question.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Patrick Wood: Beautiful. Thank you so much. A bit of a weird conceptual one. I'm just kind of curious about. But -- if you think of the efficiencies from your install-based entities, so over time, as you're placing more and more systems and in individual areas and regions, the install-based entities going up. Like -- is there really a margin implication for that from more efficiencies in selling into the customer base, servicing the systems? Can you see that in some areas or regions or markets where you've got a lot of density versus those where you have slightly less scale? I'm just conceptually trying to understand the effect of that over the long term. Thanks.
Jamie Samath: Well, generally, the I&A revenue are at higher margins than capital. And so as you drive utilization growth, then a greater proportion of the revenue over some period comes from the higher profit streams. And so -- well, let me ask Patrick. Is that the essence of your question?
Patrick Wood: It was more around the service and the efficiency of driving into those existing accounts rather than the mix between the two?
Gary Guthart: I'll answer quickly just in light of time. We do get some advantages of scale with geographic density in terms of cost to support an account. So service, service depots, sales support, training support, as that becomes more dense, it does give us some cost advantages to serve them. Is that where you're headed?
Patrick Wood: That's the way. Thanks so much.
Gary Guthart: Thanks so much. That was our last question. In closing, we believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute intervention. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quintuple aim, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, better access to great care and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Q3 of 2024 was a good quarter for us with healthy procedure growth, solid capital placements and strong operational execution in a dynamic global environment. I'll kick off by providing a perspective on our platforms and our regions. Starting with our multiport system, we now have an install base of roughly 9,300 globally. Our five-year procedure compound annual growth rate in multi-port has been 17% with approximately 16 million total patients treated using DaVinci multi-port platforms of which approximately 10 million were in the past five years. Manufacturing logistics and service capability has increased over the past several years, helping assure availability for our customers, while managing margins. System stability taken across our multi-port product lines has been outstanding, setting a standard for dependability. We launched our fifth generation multi-port system in March this year and have installed 188 today with over 12,000 procedures completed using DaVinci 5 in roughly six months. DaVinci 5 is bringing outstanding improvements for surgeons, care teams, and hospitals in addition to first of their kind features that we think will improve patient outcomes. We're moving towards our broad launch and are well into the process of securing additional global regulatory clearances for DaVinci 5, which you'll hear about later in the call. Turning to our endoluminal system, we launched Ion in Q3 of 2019. Today, the Ion install base is 736, of which 722 are in the United States. Physicians have completed more than 150,000 lung biopsies using Ion to-date, each one of which uses a machine learning created anatomically segmented lung model based on the patient specific anatomy, personalized digital intervention for every case. Our five-year compound annual growth rate for Ion procedures has been 205%. There are over 100 peer-reviewed articles assessing Ion. Overall safety and accuracy data has been outstanding. Over the past year, we have focused on excellence in product quality, product availability, and customer experience. We have updated Ion with significant feature and software upgrades 5 times since its launch, and have made dozens of improvements to our catheters and vision probes. Over the next two years, we'll expand our efforts to place systems beyond the United States, to continue system and software innovation, to increase utilization in existing U.S. accounts, and in continued pursuit of additional indication. We launched DaVinci SP in Q3 of 2018 and the installed base now stands at 243. SP procedures have been growing at a five-year category of 55% with 67,000 total procedures completed to-date. We've seen strong SP performance in Korea encouraging early growth in Europe and Japan and have increased our cadence of regulatory activity globally to broaden its applicability. The SP clinical evidence base stands at over 500 peer review journal articles. SP has found stronger uptake outside the United States as clinical indications in Europe, Japan, Korea, and now Taiwan are broader than the U.S. Our SP team is focused on extending our instrument lineup, including stapling and advanced energy, on increasing indications in the U.S., on enabling proctoring networks in global markets, and on next generation SP system innovation. In our digital efforts, nearly 3,000 DaVinci virtual reality simulators are in the installed base, and surgeons complete approximately 15,000 hours of training on simulators per quarter. Our active surgeon users for My Intuitive app now exceed 14,000. Intuitive Hub is enabled in approximately 2,000 operating rooms. We have performed our analytics program custom hospital analytics over 4,000 times and at a run rate of several hundred per quarter. Our digital team is focused on three enabling pillars: digital tools that improve outcomes in the OR and interventional suite, tools that help create better care teams faster, and tools that drive efficiencies and lower total cost of ownership, all while pursuing outstanding capabilities in cybersecurity and data privacy. Dave will touch on our digital progress shortly. Regionally, we have been investing to build a balanced country and regional teams that allow us to serve customers globally with high-quality interactions. These include commercial activity, pair engagement, R&D, logistics, and production capabilities in region. This has been a multi-year effort that has increased customer satisfaction and strengthened our global capability. Our five-year compound annual growth rate for procedures in the Europe region has been 21%. In the Asia region, our five-year procedure CAGR has been 25%. And other markets outside the U.S. it has been 18%. Reimbursement coverage for robot-assistant surgery has been obtained or expanded for dozens of procedures in many of the countries we serve. That said, we're still relatively early in our opportunity to localize our capabilities to serve more patients around the world. Overall, our teams have been strengthening our ability to serve our customers globally at industrial scale, expanding the applicability of robot-assisted surgery and other interventions by pursuing new platforms, products and services, and obtaining new clinical indications. We've also been strengthening our digital ecosystem to support our customers and our company with high quality data and insight. The opportunity to improve outcomes for patients and our customers quintuple aim through advanced technology ecosystems like ours is bigger than ever and we are focused on discipline execution to get there. I now turn the time over to Dave to take you through clinical R&D and operational updates.
Dave Rosa: Thank you, Gary. Starting with procedures, DaVinci procedure growth in the quarter was 18%, aided by an additional business day relative to Q3 2023. Growth again centered on general surgery in the U.S., with accretive contributions to the global growth rate from Japan, Germany, France, and the U.K. In Asia, we have mixed market conditions, largely consistent with the first-half of the year. Jamie will describe these dynamics later in the call. Turning to capital, we placed 379 DaVinci systems in the quarter, including 110 DaVinci 5 systems and 21 SP systems. We also installed 58 Ion systems in the quarter. Capital placements were solved in the U.S., Japan, India, and our distribution markets, and capital pressure in Europe and China continued. System utilization, defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter, grew 4% globally year-over-year for our multi-port platforms, 9% for SP, and 11% for Ion. Turning to our finances, revenue grew 17% in the quarter and spending was within our expectations. Our spending reflects investment in research and development to support the growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing facilities, and planned leverage from our enabling functions. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call. In Q3, we continued our measured rollout of DaVinci 5 placing 110 systems as the launch progresses in line with our plans. We are encouraged by broad use of the platform across specialties with customers expressing a preference for DaVinci 5. Last month, about 1,200 healthcare professionals gathered at our annual user conference, Intuitive 360, to highlight various aspects of their robotic programs. Customers have completed over 12,000 cases with DaVinci 5, and several presented their early case data around efficiency and force feedback. A number of customers have reported console time savings when comparing DaVinci 5 to Xi, and we look forward to broader analyses as more data becomes available. For force feedback, Dr. Laila Rashidi from MultiCare Health in Tacoma, a leading voice on gentler surgery and its impact on recovery for her colorectal patients, described her results. Even with her focus on managing surgical forces, Dr. Rashidi’s initial cases with DaVinci 5 show a further reduction in force of about 20% when force feedback is used. Force feedback is a complex technology that we have been pursuing for more than two decades, and it stems from a belief that less force on tissue can lead to improved patient experiences. We also believe force feedback may accelerate learning for care teams, and we will continue to study the use of force feedback with our customers. We expect more publications over the coming quarters, and our teams continue working hard to improve product margin and increase supply of force feedback instruments. As we have said before, maturing these insights will take time. Turning to our digital efforts, we believe that digital innovations on our DaVinci and Ion platforms can extract unique clinical and operational insights. Coupled with electronic medical record data, these insights should become a core part of improving outcomes, learning, and efficiencies in the future. To-date, we have data from millions of procedures that enable customers to review operational metrics, such as instruments used, procedure duration, and more. In addition, hundreds of thousands of these cases are connected to corresponding de-identified electronic medical records, enabling certain clinical and operational hypotheses to be tested. Case insights is our new analytical tool in My Intuitive that will add kinematic, force feedback, and video data to physicians' post-operative case reports, further enabling analyses to identify a connection between DaVinci system data and clinical or operational outcomes. We are at the early stages of innovative technology we believe will be powerful, but it will require rapid cycles of innovation and take time to build validated data sets. In Q3, we submitted our CE technical file in Europe. Last week, we received clearance for DaVinci 5 in Korea and are back and forth in the regulatory process in Japan. This quarter, we began shipping our DaVinci 5 broad launch hardware and completed a software update that addresses aspects of early customer feedback. We are driving toward broad launch mid-year of 2025 when we expect to be at scale on our manufacturing operations and will have released a software update enabling the integrated hub and simulator along with various digital and imaging features. Moving to instruments and accessories, in Q3 we obtained 510(k) clearance for our 8 millimeter SureForm 30 stapler expanding our advanced instrument portfolio of SureForm staplers that currently includes 12 millimeter versions of 60, 45, and 30-millimeter lengths. 8-millimeter SureForm 30 is primarily used in cases where the decreased diameter enables surgeons to better visualize and access tissue and tight spaces as often seen in thoracic or kidney procedures. We are starting our commercial journey in China with Ion, where we placed two systems and saw physicians perform their first cases. We will begin working with a number of medical centers to collect data that will inform our broader commercialization strategy in the country. In Europe, our early launch expanded into Germany and Italy. Turning to SP, in the quarter we received clearance with broad indications in Taiwan similar to Korea, Japan, and Europe. We also completed a U.S. 510(k) submission for a colorectal indication. Commercialization in Europe continues according to plan and we're encouraged by early customer interest for SP. Now I'd like to share with you some recently published peer review literature that we found to be notable. In addition to the specific data highlighted on this call, we encourage you to consider the wide body of evidence detailing these topics in published scientific studies over the years. In August, at the 2024 American Association for Oncology and Interventional Pulmonology Annual Conference, Dr. Bryan Husta from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center presented results from the CONFIRM study. CONFIRM is a prospective multi-center study evaluating outcomes from the integrated Ion Endoluminal System and Mobile Cone Beam CT in the biopsy of pulmonary nodules less than 2 centimeters in size. 155 patients from six centers throughout the U.S. were involved. With a median nodule size of 14 millimeters, the integrated platform enabled a tool-in nodule rate of 99.4%, with a diagnostic yield of 90% and zero pneumothorax observed. Subgroup analysis demonstrated consistent results across all centers, with high diagnostic yields observed regardless of nodule size, location, or presence of CT bronchus sign. The presented conclusion noted “integrated shape sensing robotic assisted bronchoscopy and mobile cone beam CT demonstrated a high diagnostic yield and excelled the safety for small complex nodules with reproducible results across physicians and institutions. These results suggested that integrated platform may be able to compete with a trans-thoracic biopsy approach in small nodules.” Earlier this year, Dr. Maegawa from the Department of surgery at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, published in the journal surgery, a study comparing robotic and laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures for benign indications performed in 2022. Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database, over 59,000 patients were included in this study with over 53,000 in the laparoscopic arm and approximately 5,500 in the robotic assisted arm. Through a multivariable logistic regression analysis, which controlled for confounding factors, patients undergoing a robotic-assisted cholecystectomy had an 18% lower chance of experiencing a serious complication, as well as a 56% lower chance of a conversion to open and 24% lower risk of requiring hospitalization for more than 24 hours. The authors also looked at elective cholecystectomies only and reported a 46% lower chance of conversion to open, 59% lower chance of re-operation, and 30% lower odds of a hospitalization over 24 hours associated with robotic-assisted cholecystectomies. The authors concluded “using a large and recent national surgical database, the study showed that overall robotic cholecystectomies were independently associated with a lower risk of serious complications, lower rate of conversions to open, and lower risk of hospitalization greater than 24 hours when compared to laparoscopy. These findings suggest that the adoption of new technologies might enhance the safety of minimally invasive surgery in selected cases.” In closing, we are committed to our 2024 priorities, supporting our measured launch of DaVinci 5 and our other new platforms by region, supporting surgeons' adoption of focused procedures, continuing to improve product quality and margins, and finally improving productivity in those functions that benefit from global scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances and procedure highlights in greater detail.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis and will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Core metrics continue to be strong in Q3 with DaVinci procedure growth of 18%, installed base growth of DaVinci systems of 15%, and overall DaVinci system utilization up 3%. Procedure growth in Q3 benefited from a higher number of business days compared to the year ago period. On a day adjusted basis, Q3 procedure growth was 17%. U.S. procedures grew 16% driven by growth in benign general surgery. On a day adjusted basis, bariatrics procedures in the U.S. declined in the mid-single-digit range, similar to last quarter. OUS procedures grew 24%, reflecting strong growth in general surgery, gynecology, and thoracic procedures. Within our OUS markets, growth was strong in the U.K. and India and solid in Japan, Germany, France, and Italy. Procedure growth in South Korea improved from the prior quarter but was still below longer term historical trends given the ongoing precision strike. In China, procedure growth was below the corporate average given recent system placement trends reflecting several market dynamics that we have previously described and domestic robotic competition. With respect to capital performance, we placed 379 systems in the third quarter, compared with 312 systems in Q3 of last year. In the U.S., we placed 219 systems in quarter three, compared to 159 systems placed in Q3 of last year. U.S. system placements in the quarter included 110 DaVinci 5 placements. As supply of DaVinci 5 increases and we move into broad launch mid-next year, we expect that placements in the U.S. will progressively shift toward transactions. Outside the U.S., we placed 160 systems in quarter three, compared with 153 systems last year. Excluding trading transactions, net new system placements in OUS markets increased 28% year-over-year. Q3 system placements included 65 into Europe, 39 into Japan, and 14 into China, compared with 60 into Europe, 32 into Japan, and 10 into China in quarter three of last year. Placements in Europe continue to be challenged by ongoing government budget pressures impacting healthcare capital spending. Third quarter revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 17% from last year, driven by DaVinci procedure growth, expansion of the DaVinci installed base, and growth in our Ion business. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was also 17%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: leasing represented 58% of Q3 placements, higher than recent periods, reflecting relative capital strength in the U.S., where a much greater proportion of our customers prefer to lease systems. Q3 system average selling prices were $1.51 million, as compared to $1.4 million last year. Higher year-over-year system ASPs reflected a higher mix of DaVinci 5 and a lower mix of trade-ins. We'd recognize $24 million of lease buyout revenue in quarter three, compared with $28 million last quarter and $17 million last year. DaVinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800, flat to the prior quarter and lower than last year's $1,830. The year-over-year decline in I&A per procedure was primarily driven by a lower mix of bariatrics procedures and a higher mix of procedures in markets served by distributors. Turning to our Ion platform, procedures grew 73% to approximately 25,000 procedures in the third quarter. In Q3, we placed 58 Ion systems, compared to 55 last year and 74 last quarter. As a reminder, first-half Ion placements reflected a catch up of backlog as supply of catheters and vision probes improved. Q3 Ion system placements included three placements in Europe and our first two placements in China. The install base of Ion systems increased 50% year-over-year to 736 systems, of which 296 are under operating lease arrangements. Third quarter SP procedure growth was 70%, with strong multi-specialty growth in Korea, strong growth in the U.S., and early-stage growth in Japan and Europe. 21 of the systems placed in the quarter were SP systems, of which 15 placements were in OUS markets. The SP installed base grew 54% from the year ago quarter to 243 systems. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 69.1%, compared with 68.8% for the third quarter of 2023 and 70% last quarter. The year-over-year improvement in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects leveraged or fixed overhead, lower component costs, and lower logistics costs, partially offset by higher inventory reserves. During the quarter we opened our new system manufacturing facility at our East Coast Hub in Peachtree Corners, Georgia, commencing production of X and Xi systems at that site. We also opened our new Global Capability Centre in Bangalore, India, where we are co-locating our local commercial and training teams and the global center for IT and other shared service resources. As a reminder, given recent and ongoing capital investments, we expect a significant increase in depreciation expense in 2025 as we bring online additional facilities. Third quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 13%, compared with last year, driven by higher headcount, increased legal expenses, and higher customer facing activities. Consistent with the last couple of years, we have held pro forma R&D expenses at roughly 11% of revenue given our prioritization of investments in innovation that drive the quintuple aim and our growth. SG&A expenses continue to leverage as we benefit from prior investments that allow us to scale efficiently with growth. During the quarter we added approximately 617 employees, of which just over half were in our high volume I&A manufacturing facility in Mexicali to support procedure growth. On a year-to-date basis, through Q3 2024, pro forma operating margin was 36% of revenue, an increase of 184 basis points, compared to the same period in 2023 driven by higher gross margin and leverage of SG&A expenses. As a result of revenue growth and higher operating margins, on a year-to-date basis, pro forma EPS increased 25% from the prior year. Pro forma other income was $94.6 million for Q3, higher than $79.4 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Given the interest rate environment, we expect that the average interest yield on our cushion investments will decline going into 2025. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 20.5%, reflecting discrete benefits of approximately $12 million, primarily relating to the expiration of statutory limitations for certain tax reserves and an adjustment to our deferred tax assets. Third quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $669 million or $1.84 per share, compared with $524 million or $1.46 per share for the third quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $565 million or $1.56 per share for the third quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $416 million or $1.16 per share for the third quarter of 2023. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges, and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended Q3 with cash and investments of $8.3 billion, higher than the $7.7 billion we ended last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash generated from operating activities partially offset by capital expenditures of $248 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brandon to discuss our updated outlook.
Brandon Lamb: Thank you, Jamie. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full-year 2024 procedure growth within a range of 15.5% and 17%. We are now raising the low end from 15.5% to 16% and expect full-year 2024 procedure growth within a range of 16% and 17%. The low-end of the range assumes further softening and bariatric procedures along with increasing headwinds in Asia from physician strikes in Korea and from delayed tenders in domestic robotic systems in China impacting capital placements and therefore procedure growth. At the high end of the range, we assume bariatric stabilizes at current quarter growth rates and headwinds in Korea and China do not get worse. The range does not reflect significant impact to elective procedures as a result of IV shortages or other hurricane-related impacts. Turning to gross profit, we continue to expect pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 68.5% and 69% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product, regional, and trading mix and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses, on our last call we forecasted full0year 2024 pro forma operating expense growth to be within a range of 10% and 13%. We are now lowering the high-end of our estimate and expect full-year 2024 pro forma operating expense growth to be within a range of 10% and 12%. We expect non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $670 million and $690 million in 2024. We are increasing our estimate for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $325 million and $345 million in 2024. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, we expect the pro forma income tax rate for 2024 to be within a range of 22% and 23% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the first question in queue. Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Travis Steed: Maybe just a little more on thinking about the DV5 ramp between now and the mid-2025 broad launch, do you expect to make any more upgrades or add software? And I'd love to dig in a little bit on the customer reactions to some of the contribution margin benefits, contribution margin benefits of DV5, kind of, what you're seeing there on the early data and if hospital CFOs are resonating with some of that early profitable data for DV5?
Dave Rosa: Hey Travis, this is Dave. I will answer some of your questions around kind of where are we going from here to broad launch? So in terms of software updates, we'll continue to make them as they're scheduled in our plans. And you'll see those come out on a semi-routine basis. We have to get to broad launch as described in my comments, we have a release that will enable some of that hardware and some additional software features in that broad launch time frame. For the supply side of DV5, we expect that to increase modestly quarter-over-quarter as we get into next year and into broad launch. On the contribution margin side, maybe Jamie, over to you.
Jamie Samath: Yes, I'd just say that obviously there was a publication in one of the executive publications that we assisted with. It was illustrative in terms of the contribution margin gains that an institution might get given what we're seeing with respect to efficiency. We have a number of early surgeons that are KOLs that have sophistication in terms of use of DaVinci that are reporting improvements in console time, and that allows for both efficiency in the given procedure and perhaps the opportunity to have higher throughput on the platform. And I think that's part of the conversation with administration. I'd say that's early and I think we look to collect evidence and validation as we get into the broad launch. But early feedback from a number of our surgeons has been focused on the efficiency gains they've seen.
Operator: And we'll go to the next question Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the question. One on international for me, one on procedures, if I may. The Korean approval, I think, came earlier than people expected. Do you have supply to launch there right away? And just what's the update on Japan timing? I heard the back and forth in the prepared remarks. And how long are you expecting the review process in Europe to take? And I had one follow-up.
Dave Rosa: Yes, thanks. We do have supply to be able to support Korea demand and so that is true. We have not outlined timing in Japan, so we remain in that back and forth. And then with respect to CE mark in Europe, it's no different from last quarter where we expect that near the end of next year 2025.
Larry Biegelsen: Got it, that's helpful. And for Dave or Gary, we've heard you and key opinion leaders recently start talking about new procedures such as appendectomy, foregut, hepatobiliary and emergent procedures. Could you please tell us where you are in addressing these from a clinical, regulatory, and commercial standpoint, and how would you size some of these new procedures? Thanks.
Jamie Samath: Yes. With respect to foregut and HPB, we've actually been in those procedures in the U.S. for some time. They've been growing nicely for us. Currently the growth rates for them are accretive to the U.S. average. They are both relatively small categories and that's probably why they haven't gone a lot of air time in terms of our commentary. Appendectomy is much earlier for us. It's quite a small procedure. It is also a creative growth. I think what you're seeing with appendectomy is as surgeons have adopted Xi over time, as they've expanded their kind of taking a practice approach to general surgery, what you see is that then gets extended into emerging care settings, acute care settings, and they start to use Xi more routinely. We have done some clinical work on appendectomy. We do have an indication with the FDA in the U.S. On appendectomy. That's a small procedure for us and obviously is concentrated in immersion settings.
Operator: Okay, and we'll go to the next question from Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Robbie Marcus: Yes, congrats on a great quarter. Two for me might both be for Jamie. I'll let you decide. Maybe first, the margins were once again really impressive, both gross margin and operating margin. Really the question is, how much more room do you feel like there is to go? We're just starting to see DaVinci 5 flow through, and I know there is definitely some depreciation benefit flowing through this year that probably wanes into next year and we're coming off a very heavy investment period. So I guess the question is, as we move forward, how should we think about the margin progression as you have these new products flowing through and the mix starts to evolve?
Jamie Samath: Yes, maybe just some framing first. I think we've consistently said we look to have margins that are kind of top tier with respect to our med tech peers. We've also said that we don't have a management expectation to have our op margins above 40%. I know they were at that level back pre-COVID, but we don't have a management objective to be back at that level and that's just us balancing the rate of investment with what we think is the right level of profitability. We were 37% of margin this quarter, 36% year-to-date. What I would expect is for 2025 on the gross margin front just given the significant incremental depreciation that we've described, you should expect gross margins to be a little lower next year as we start to take on board that incremental depreciation expense. And you'll have a period as those new facilities come online where, in fact, we're period expensing that depreciation, because you're early in the phase of kind of ramping production in those facilities versus capitalizing them into inventory. I think what we've said in the mid-term is we have the opportunity, we think, on gross margin to get back to 70%. That's our aspiration. But if you think about where we are right now, year-to-date, 36%, we don't have a management objective to be above 40%. There's a relatively narrow range over the mid-term to improve. The question of what we do over that midterm will also be balanced by how much we invest in R&D, which is going to be a function of the opportunities that we see.
Robbie Marcus: Great. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, as we move into next year and you talked about expect more of the trade-ins coming from DaVinci 5 as you move into full launch. There's an opportunity, obviously, to repurpose and resell some of the refurbished Xis that you get traded in. Just maybe speak to the opportunity there, how we should think about that, and any immediate plans you can talk about. Thanks a lot.
Jamie Samath: Yes, so you should expect us to, as the trading cycle occurs, which by the way we think will be progressive and will occur over multiples of years, as Xis come back, we will, as we've done in the past, refurbish those. That does allow for segmentation that could be site of care segmentation, for example, in the U.S. and segmentation in markets internationally that are more consensitive. We haven't worked through exactly what those plans will be, but you could expect within that framing, that's kind of what we'll do with respect to refurbished Xis.
Operator: And we'll go to the next line here. David Roman, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
David Roman: Thank you and good afternoon everybody. Maybe we can start on Ion. I think if you look in a variety of public forums, there's been a considerable amount of promotional activity both in the U.S. and Europe as you've launched in new markets. Maybe you could help us think about where we are in the Ion launch and adoption curve in each of the target geographies and how we should think about growth in that segment on a go-forward basis? And then I have one P&L follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Sure, I'll take that one. Hi David, it's Gary. In the U.S., I think Ion is progressing well in its first indication of biopsy of suspicious lung nodules. We think it's crossed the chasm. It should be in double-digit prevalence in terms of total biopsy use. So I think there the focus is a little bit less now on the earliest customers. I think the early customers have done great. We're pretty deeply penetrated into those sites of care. And the focus there will be on high utilization, high customer satisfaction, some innovation, and pursuit of additional indications inside the lung using the Ion platform. We're much earlier in our journey outside of the United States. So early experiences so far in Europe first started in the U.K. They're building some momentum off an early base and then early, early steps into Germany. Likewise early, early steps into China. So it's a little bit of a two-phased approach here. In the U.S., a strong move toward high utilization, high satisfaction, moving out of the first concentrated set of customers, and in OUS, it's really initiating the journey in different markets.
David Roman: That's super helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the P&L. One of the things that was notable this quarter and has been the past couple is the increased percentage of systems being placed under usage agreements. And it's gone from about 12% earlier this year to about 15% now. Can you have a think about the trajectory of that contribution to the placement model and what that means for the P&L?
Jamie Samath: Well, so those arrangements are a subset of operating leases and obviously those arrangements are where the customer pays for system and service as they use the system. Those arrangements with the customers have an expectation of what the procedures will be done per year. That's reflected in the arrangement. And so then at target economics you should think of it as similar to a regular operating lease that's a fixed payment arrangement and operating leases in general are slightly accretive to a purchase, because of the embedded interest rate in there. Of course, the difference with a usage-based arrangement is then you have the risk of what is the actual usage of the customer in those usage-based arrangements. We have a distribution, as you would expect, in terms of what the usage rates are, and we engage with the customers regularly with respect to what their business plans are, particularly when they're not at the target. In terms of trajectory, obviously you've seen it grow. It is popular with customers. It is a way to both access additional capacity without having to consume capital budgets and it does lower the risk for the customer in terms of taking a new system relative to how well that's going to be utilized. We have provisions and protections in those arrangements for us and for the customer and we look at those routinely. I would expect it to continue to grow, but it's relatively highly penetrated in the U.S. and so that the rate of growth will likely moderate. In the international markets we're at a much earlier stage, so I think that's too early to call in terms of how that might grow.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Rick Wise of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Gary, Dave, everybody. We continue to have a lot of conversations with surgeons, who are interested or potentially interested in DaVinci 5? And I'm not saying this is an accurate sample, but just it's our sample. I get the sense from the larger hospitals, the academic centers, that they're more waiting. They're waiting for dual console availability. And they're saying to me, as our smaller hospitals, that you're more focused right now on I'll call it mid to smaller institutions, non-academic, they're making decisions faster, they're less dependent on a dual console. Is that right? Is that what's going on? And I wonder what a couple things, whether procedure growth implications are affected positively or negatively by that. And when dual console is more available in the middle of next year when you're full-launch, I assume, do we see an acceleration in sort of multi-system, bigger hospital decision-making?
Gary Guthart: Dave, I'll let you speak to just dual console availability and what's going on there, and then we can speak a little bit to what the trends are. We'll answer those questions.
Dave Rosa: Hey Rick, and you said it. So in this, as we're ramping our supply capabilities, console is being prioritized with incremental single system deals. And so as we build our capacity, we will start producing additional consoles for dual system placements. In terms of prioritization and where they're being prioritized, I think our team is working with broad sets of customers and to understand what their needs are and if DaVinci 5 is the right system to meet their needs for their program. And I don't have a lot of information about how that may differ between smaller customers as you put it in academics or larger institutions.
Gary Guthart: I wouldn't anticipate a significant forecast model change one way or another. I think as we go to broad launch and the pipe opens up, we will seek to serve all those customers. I don't think it inflects procedure growth rate one way or another because of dual console and large versus small. I suspect that's a hard analysis to do and if you do it, I suspect the differences will be relatively small relative to what we expect.
Rick Wise: And a quick follow-up, if I could, on Hub. I think it was exciting to hear our in over 2,000 ORs just help us think through the early experience there and maybe the implications for both DaVinci 5 and again, procedures. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yes. So Hub as it exists today, and that includes our generation four compatibility as well as those that are linked to Gen 5. What does it do? It's a strong data recorder and media management device. A lot of those early installs are on-premise implementations versus the cloud. Customers enjoy for their ability to track their data and to assess post-op performance, which has been great. Over time, as we move forward and move toward cloud implementations and other things, I think that it provides them a lot of leverage there's a lot that we like about it. I think the core capability is really good. There are some things we want to work on. I think refinement, workflow, making those things really easy integration in DV5 is going to be great. We're really excited about it. I think it matters. So far, so good. I think we're at the beginning of the Hub journey, both in terms of penetration and in terms of future content not the end of it. And I'm proud of the progress the team is making.
Operator: We're going to go over to the line of Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Adam Maeder: Hi, good afternoon, congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask for some additional color around the capital environment and how you're thinking about hospital budgets and appetite for larger piece of the capital heading into the end of the year in 2025. And I heard the commentary around Europe and China, it sounds like there's continued pressure there. Just curious, is that kind of status quo versus the first half of the year? Is it getting worse? And kind of how do you expect that to evolve going forward? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks
Gary Guthart: Jamie, why don't you take the broad answer, and then I'll touch on China at the end.
Jamie Samath: Yes. I think I'd characterize U.S. is relatively stable, albeit with a lot of interest in DaVinci 5. I think that's kind of raised the profile again in interest in robotics to some extent. But I'd characterize the overall capital environment is relatively stable. In Europe, what you're seeing particularly in countries like the U.K. and Germany is pressure on capital spending in the health care space, again, related to government budget pressures that exist there. And I think that's been similar for the last quarter or so. In the case of Europe, we have some government-related events that come in the next couple of quarters, but too early to predict how that might play out in terms of the changes in the capital dynamics.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Just turning to China. There's clearly broad stress across the health care market in total in China, there's kind of a rebaselining there in some of the value-based pricing that has gone through as well as some of the price caps that have gone through in our end of the market. So I think that pressure is still there. I think it will be there for some quarters. I don't think that resolves quickly. There's also in our universe, the entry of some domestic competitors that tend to get provincial preferences, the province in which they're headquartered tends to have a preference for them as they launch. And so you see that kind of show up as popcorn as it goes around. I think that will persist for a little while, too. So for us, I think it's not a surprise given the year we've had. I think ultimately, these things will wash through how long it takes for it to walk through and stabilizes as yet on them.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Brandon Vazquez, William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon Vazquez: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. You have a good amount of DaVinci 5 systems out there. I was just curious if you could compare and contrast. Are there any kind of unique insights that you have in that DaVinci 5 installed base, whether it's what types of procedures they're doing or utilization within those accounts are those systems relative to the rest of the Xi base? And then maybe just one quick follow-up, I'll throw here now. Can you talk a little bit -- it sounds like innovation on a go-forward basis is really going to be coming a lot from software. Can you kind of compare and contrast the innovation cycle the speed at which you can launch new features on the software side versus what has historically been, I would guess, a little bit of a longer cycle in hardware?
Jamie Samath: Yes. So I may try to hit both of those -- on the DaVinci 5 side and the comparison to Xi, one of the things that we're pleased with is it is being used across a broad set of procedures. And so customers with the limited supply are really using them to their fullest. With respect to how do you compare DaVinci 5 utilization to Xi, it's really too soon to say. The installed base isn't big enough with a long enough history yet to give us a good data set to make those comparisons. On the software side, the -- there's kind of two buckets that we operate in there are sets of software and products that are nonmedical device. And those are able to have more rapid cycles of innovation and our ability to roll it out to the field. And then there is a second set that our 510(k) or governed by regulatory processes around the globe. And those will generally follow a longer cadence, probably still a bit quicker than you would see in major hardware changes and things like that. And so on the average, likely we'll see software upgrades and updates happen on a more -- on a higher cadence, but it kind of depends on which bucket they fall into.
Gary Guthart: I might challenge the assumption a little bit. I think there's still some hardware we want to do. I don't think hardware is going away. I think that's going to continue and DV5 has some opportunities for that, too. and we'll do the software that you just described. I think it's great, but we get a chance to do both. Operator, we'll take one more questioner, and then we'll close.
Operator: And that's from the line of Matt Miksic, Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matt Miksic: Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Maybe just a big picture kind of a follow-on question. I get some version of this question often from investors, talking about growth drivers, opportunities in procedure growth. And so maybe if you're looking at the U.S. market and the rate that you're growing now, obviously, where penetration is and where it could go over time. Do you expect maybe in the next couple of years or three years to be driven more by driving deeper into existing procedures and categories? Or do you see any sort of new large segments, important segments that you expect to help drive that growth would you say the mix looks like or any color you'd be able to add would be super helpful? Thanks
Gary Guthart: Yes. Thank you, Matt. It's a great question. I look at. I think in the U.S., we're -- I won't give you the exact split, but I think it's a balanced perspective. Clearly, we have approaching the back half of some curves and some procedures where it's really about depth. What do the folks who have not yet participated or are participating fully, what do they need from us to keep going and to serve the patients that way. There's still opportunity there. In some ways, there's plenty of opportunity. At the same time, as you start getting to the back half, you want to make sure you're looking for, we want to make sure we're looking for new opportunities and opportunities to serve a different set of patients that we haven't engaged before, and you're starting to see us do that, whether it's in new indications for Ion or SP. And we think actually in multiport, there's some opportunity and new indication also, although they'll tend to be more niche markets than really big ones. Over time, over the coming quarters, we'll tell you more about that as those opportunities mature. So thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute intervention. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quintupling, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams that are access to great care and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you again for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-18 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you everyone for standing by and welcome to the Intuitive Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Release. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Brian King. Please go ahead.
Brian King: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive second quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; Dave Rosa, our President; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com, on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will introduce the call and provide an organization update. Dave will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2024. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in the quarter, with solid procedure growth and strong capital placements resulting in healthy financial performance. In the quarter, we made good progress with all three of our system platforms, including taking our measured rollout of da Vinci 5 to our next phase, continuing to stabilize Ion supply in support of customer expansion and expanding da Vinci SP installs in Europe, while supporting SP procedure growth across regions. Some multi-port procedure headwinds continued from last quarter and we will describe these later on the call. Before turning the time over to Dave, I'd like to thank Marshall Mohr, our prior CFO and our outgoing Head of Global Business Services. Marshall will be taking his skills to pursuits outside of Intuitive in September this year, as he approaches his next endeavor. I thank him on behalf of all of us for his outstanding stewardship at Intuitive for the past 18 years. We are pleased to announce that in addition to his role as CFO, Jamie will expand his responsibilities to leading our information technology and global facilities teams. I'll now turn the time over to Dave, who will take you through commercial and operational highlights in greater detail.
Dave Rosa: Thank you, Gary. Starting with procedures, we experienced solid growth in the quarter of nearly 17% compared with a strong Q2 2023, which reflected the return of patients post pandemic. Cholecystectomy, colon resection, lung resection and foregut procedures led global procedure growth. General surgery led U.S. procedure growth in the second quarter and outside the U.S., procedure growth was led by non-urology procedures. Regional performance included strength in Europe, led by Germany, the U.K. and Italy. And in Asia, we have mixed market conditions largely consistent with Q1. Brian will describe these dynamics later in the call. Turning to capital, we placed 341 da Vinci systems in the quarter, of which 320 were multiport systems, including 70 da Vinci 5 systems. Our teams installed 21 SP systems and 74 Ion systems in the quarter, with solid capital placements in the U.S., Japan and India and pressure in Europe and China. System utilization defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter grew 2% globally year-over-year for our multiport platforms, lower than our historical trend, reflecting procedure strength a year ago due to patient backlogs. Utilization for SP and Ion continued to grow in the double digit range in the quarter. Turning to our finances, revenue growth of 14% in the quarter reflect solid procedure performance and strong capital placements. Product margins were above our expectations, reflecting a combination of cost reductions, fixed overhead leverage and some one-time nonrecurring benefits. Operating expenses reflected plan leverage in our enabling functions. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call. In Q2, we moved into the next phase of our rollout of da Vinci 5. Within the quarter, we placed 70 da Vinci 5 systems. As the launch continues to progress in line with our plans, customer feedback points to improvements in precision, imaging, ergonomics and integration, the combination of which customers indicate has led to overall efficiency improvements. Both Force Feedback and Case Insights bring new capabilities and analytics to surgery. We are encouraged by early insights these capabilities are presenting and are working hard to improve production and supply for Force Feedback instruments and smooth our computational pipelines and workflows for Case Insights. We expect these capabilities to be powerful and the maturity and evidence of impact to build over coming quarters. We launched new products thoughtfully centered around outstanding customer experiences. As our customers pursue operational and clinical excellence, we continue monitoring several key metrics across our measured rollout of da Vinci 5, as we ramp our supply and respond to customer input. We expect our measured rollout to continue through the first half of 2025. Adoption of our digital products and services grew nicely in the quarter, with routine use of My Intuitive App expanding to nearly 14,000 surgeons and surgeons using Intuitive Hub more than doubling versus a year ago. The long-term opportunity for computational tools is both significant and difficult. To recognize these benefits at scale requires a foundational infrastructure that includes robust, curated data, secure data warehousing and global privacy compliance. Our digital ecosystem, including Case Insights, leverages this infrastructure and enables us to collaborate with customers on a global scale to identify meaningful insights. These insights enable customers to optimize their robotic programs and ultimately reduce time to proficiency and improve clinical outcomes. As we said before, validations take time and are a worthy pursuit. Turning to Ion, our teams have made material progress resolving supply constraints on catheters and vision probes. Excellence in manufacturing at scale in this space is complex and we continue to reinforce our capabilities. Our commercialization in Europe continues according to plan and our teams are progressing towards commercialization in China. Turning to SP, last week we received FDA clearance for thoracic procedures. We will be measured in our thoracic indication launch, as we work to build a robust training and proctoring network, as well as bring stapling to our SP platform. In closing, we are committed to our 2024 priorities, supporting our measured launch of da Vinci 5 and our other new platforms by region, supporting surgeons adoption of focus procedures, continuing to improve product quality and margins and finally improving productivity in those functions that benefit from global scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis and we'll also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q2 da Vinci procedures grew 17%. The installed base of systems grew 14% to just over 9200 systems and average system utilization increased by 2%, lower than long-term historical averages, reflecting procedure strength in Q2 last year, as a result of patient backlogs U.S. procedures grew 14%, driven by growth in general surgery. Bariatric procedures in the U.S. declined in the mid-single digit range. OUS procedures grew 22%, reflecting strong growth in general surgery, gynecology and thoracic procedures. With respect to capital performance, we placed 341 systems in the second quarter, compared to 331 systems in Q2 of last year. In the U.S., we placed 149 systems in Q2, compared to 157 systems placed last year, reflecting in part lower trade ins. U.S. system placements in Q2 included 70 da Vinci 5 placements. Given a planned hardware and software update to da Vinci 5 in the second half of this year and continued focus on maturing, manufacturing and expanding capacity, we expect that da Vinci 5 placements will be constrained through the first half of 2025. Outside the U.S., we placed 192 systems in quarter two compared with 174 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 71 into Europe, 41 into Japan and 14 into China, compared with 76 into Europe, 33 into Japan and 16 into China in Q2 of last year. We also saw relatively strong placements in India, as well as markets served by our distributors, including Australia. Placements in Europe reflect health system budget constraints, as several European governments are resetting capital spending post pandemic. Second quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of 14% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 15%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Leasing represented 51% of Q2 placements, relatively consistent with recent trends. However, given customer preference for our usage based models in the U.S. and the launch of da Vinci 5, we continue to expect the proportion of systems placed under lease arrangements to grow over time. Q2 system average selling prices were $1.44 million as compared to $1.39 million last year. Higher year-over-year system ASPs reflected a higher mix of da Vinci 5 and lower trade ins, partially offset by a higher mix of system placements in Japan with a weaker Yen exchange rate and lower pricing in China. In Q2 of 2023, trade-ins represented 18% of total system placements as compared to 6% in Q2 of 2024. We recognized $28 million of lease buyout revenue in quarter two, compared with $29 million last quarter and $12 million last year. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800, an increase of approximately $20 compared to last quarter. The sequential increase in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of customer ordering patterns in the U.S. Turning to our Ion platform, procedures grew 82% to approximately 23,200 procedures in the second quarter. During the quarter, we placed 74 Ion systems compared to 59 last year and 70 last quarter. During Q2, we caught up with the remaining backlog of system placements as supply of catheters and vision probes continued to improve. The in store base of Ion systems increased 56% year-over-year to 678 systems, of which 275 are under operating lease arrangements. Second quarter SP procedure growth accelerated to 74%, with strong growth in Korea and the U.S. and early stage growth in Japan and Europe. 21 of the systems placed in the quarter were SP systems, including ten systems placed in Europe. The SP installed base grew 56% from the year ago quarter to 222 systems. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2024 was ahead of our expectations at 70%, compared with 68.5% for the second quarter of 2023 and 67.6% last quarter. Second quarter pro forma gross margin reflected certain one-time benefits that we do not expect to recur. Excluding these one-time benefits, pro forma gross margin would have been 69.5%. The sequential improvement in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects lower inventory reserves, cost reductions in certain purchase components, lower freight rates and leverage of fixed overhead. In accordance with our plans, product margins for our Ion and SP platforms improved in the quarter and will remain a focus for our business unit and manufacturing teams over the medium term. As a reminder, given recent and ongoing capital investments, we expect increased depreciation expense in the second half and a significant increase in depreciation expense starting in Q1 of 2025. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 11% compared with last year, reflecting the ongoing benefit of planned leverage in enabling functions. We continue to prioritize investments in R&D to fund innovation and future growth. During the quarter, we added approximately 550 employees, of which roughly half were in our manufacturing operations to support growth in customer demand. Pro forma other income was $79.4 million for Q2, higher than $72.5 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations. Second quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $641 million or $1.78 per share, compared with $507 million or $1.42 per share for the second quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $527 million or $1.46 per share for the second quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $421 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, employee stock based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.7 billion, higher than the $7.3 billion we ended last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by capital expenditures of $309 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian.
Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Overall, second quarter procedure growth was 17% compared to 22% for the second quarter of 2023 and 16% last quarter. In the U.S., second quarter 2024 procedure growth was 14% compared to 19% for the second quarter of 2023 and 14% last quarter. Second quarter growth was led by procedures within general surgery, with strength in cholecystectomy and foregut procedures and also thoracic procedures. Bariatric procedure growth declined in the mid-single digit range. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure volume grew 22%, compared with 28% for the second quarter of 2023 and 20% last quarter. Growth was led by non-urology procedures with strength in colon resection, hysterectomy and lung resection procedures. In Europe, second quarter growth continued to be led by procedures beyond urology, primarily from general surgery and gynecology procedure categories. Germany, the U.K. and Italy procedure performance led the region with each experiencing strong growth in colon and rectal resection, hysterectomy and other general surgery procedures. In Asia, growth in the second quarter was led by Japan and India, while growth in China was stressed and Korea procedure growth continued to be impacted by physician strikes. In Japan, overall procedure growth was solid with continued strength in colon and rectal resection, gynecology and lung resection procedures. In India, while still in the early stage of adoption, we saw strength in gynecology and general surgery procedures, particularly with growth in hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and hernia repair. China procedure growth was lower than prior period averages when compared to the same quarter a year ago, which experienced a recovery in procedures impacted by COVID. System utilization remained strong, while capital placements continue to be impacted by delayed tenders and emerging domestic robotic systems. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Earlier this year, Dr. Zhang and team from the Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine published a systematic review and meta-analysis in the International Journal of Surgery that looked at open, laparoscopic and robotic assisted surgery approaches to rectal cancer management. This meta-analysis covered 56 studies and included over 25,000 patients, of which approximately 11,000 patients received robotic assisted surgery, over 13,000 patients laparoscopic surgery and over 390 patients received open surgery. When compared to the control group of both laparoscopic and open procedures, patients undergoing a robotic assisted approach had an approximately 2 day shorter length of stay. Specifically, when compared to lap, the robotic assisted group was associated with a 1.7 day shorter length of stay. Relative to open surgery, the length of stay was 5.5 days shorter. The robotic assisted approach was also demonstrated a protective effect for converting to an open procedure, with 61% lower odds of conversion associated with robotics relative to the laparoscopic approach. Finally, when compared to the laparoscopic and open control group, the robotic assisted approach showed less estimated blood loss, approximately 40% lower odds of urinary retention and when compared to open, a higher number of harvested lymph nodes. The authors concluded, "The robotic approach emerges as the most favorable option for managing rectal cancer when compared to open, laparoscopic and transanal techniques, as it delivers the finest blend of oncological, functional and patient recovery outcomes. The digital interface of surgical robots enables a shift in the paradigm of surgical training, facilitating shorter learning curves that are more comprehensive and notably reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with them". I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024. Starting with procedures, on our last call, we forecasted full year 2024 procedure growth within a range of 14% and 17%. We are now narrowing our forecast and expect full-year 2024 procedure growth of 15.5% to 17%. The low end of the range assumes further softening in bariatric procedures, along with increasing headwinds in Asia from prolonged physician strikes in Korea and in China from delayed tenders and emerging domestic robotic systems, impacting capital placements and therefore procedure growth. At the high end of the range, we assume bariatric stabilizes at current quarter rates and headwinds in Korea and China do not get worse. Turning to gross profit, we are increasing our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68.5% and 69% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses, we are lowering our guidance for pro forma operating expense growth to be between 10% and 13%. We are refining our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $680 million to $700 million in 2024. We are narrowing our guidance for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $300 million and $320 million in 2024. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, there is no change to our guidance of 2024 pro forma income tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a really nice quarter here. Of course, I have to start with da Vinci 5, really strong start here, 70 placements. I heard the comments about being constrained through the second half of 2025, but da Vinci 5 was almost half of your U.S. placement. So it looks like a strong launch. So how should we think about the ramp in da Vinci 5 placements in the second half? And how should we think about trade-ins going forward, which were probably a little lower than I expected this quarter in the U.S.? And I had one follow-up.
Jamie Samath: Hi, Larry, it's Jamie. I would say for the second half of 2024, you should expect dV 5 placements in the U.S. to increase modestly quarter-to-quarter and that in part reflects the fact that we do have this hardware, software update that we described. And so you have to organize how you do that build plan through the factory carefully for that update. And we said we'd be in a measured rollout through then the first half of 2025. With respect to how we've organized the measured rollout of dV 5, we've really focused the sales force on looking to place da Vinci 5 for incremental capacity for our customers versus the trading cycle. I think we'd rather get to a broad launch where we essentially have unconstrained supply relative to demand before we look at the trade-in cycle. Just a couple of comments on the trade-in cycle. I think I wouldn't expect a trade-in cycle to suddenly emerge and take off quickly. I think what we've seen in the past is that that's progressive and over multiples of years and in part that will reflect the fact that many customers will want to evaluate da Vinci 5, they want to see evidence grow over time in terms of its capability and feature set. And of course their desire for da Vinci 5 will depend on their individual program and what they see, the value of that in part given the higher pricing or lease costs for da Vinci 5.
Larry Biegelsen: That's very helpful. And then I wanted to ask about China. You mentioned it a couple of times on the call today. We recently saw a new stimulus announced there and my question is and you've talked about the anti-corruption initiative, is that still having an impact and how are you guys thinking about the new stimulus that was announced there? Will that help drive placements? Thanks for taking the question.
Dave Rosa: Hi, Larry, it's Dave. Answering the second part of your question, first around the stimulus. In talking to our teams, we don't see that it's going to have a material impact on the placements of systems or an impact on the quota. With respect to kind of the operating environment of China and the anti-corruption that you referenced, there's no question that the operating environment remains challenging. The health system in China is kind of rebasing around economics and medtech, I think that's clear across the industry. On the placement side, customers are continuing to value our offerings clearly and we're seeing as, you know, the emergence of domestic systems. And so in spite of those challenges and everything that's going on in the environment in China, we're still seeing double digit growth in procedures. So we remain confident and look forward to continuing our investments and focus in China.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the questions, guys.
Operator: And we'll look to next question from the line of Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Travis Steed: Hi, congrats on the good quarter. I wanted to maybe if there's any way you can help us understand the kind of the demand side of the dV 5 equation? I know we're in a constrained rollout, but 47% of the placements in the U.S. were dV 5 this quarter. And I don't know if there's any way to kind of rank order some of the factors you need to mark off and check off the list to kind of get the full launch, had the software hardware upgrade, but assume there's some other variables to consider as well.
Dave Rosa: Yes. Hi, Travis, it's Dave and again. There -- it's a couple of the factors that we've discussed in the past and it's really kind of three primary areas. One is making sure that we are maturing our supply chain and our manufacturing capacity, so that we're again able to get to the quality, to the cost, to the yields that we expect as we approach a broad launch. The second part is what Jamie described around the software and hardware update, where we're trying to get that integrated into our systems and balancing the factory output. And then the third thing is, listening to our customers. And so as these placements happen, we're listening to our customers and responding to their feedback and we'll be releasing some software updates along the way here in order to respond to that feedback. And so we want to get that in place before we get to product launch.
Gary Guthart: Travis, I would just add, your question, part of your question is on the demand side. I would say that in the early phase of a launch, you have a tendency to see early adopters look for the latest technology and also the larger institutions, the large IDNs. And so you have to kind of give it some time to see the full set of customers in terms of what that interest will be and the segments of customers, again, that will look for evidence to build over time, for customer belief to build over time. And so you probably need some time to see the full set of customers in terms of what the full picture of demand for da Vinci 5 is and again that take some time. Da Vinci 5 is a platform that, as we did with Xi will invest in overtime and so you'll build a set of capabilities also over time.
Travis Steed: That's helpful. And Jamie, maybe on the gross margin side, very strong and only one time was 50 basis points, it was kind of under the pressure, maybe initially, gross margins would be a little lighter with dV 5. Just can you elaborate on the strength and margin this quarter?
Jamie Samath: Yes, I would just say that, we kind of describe from a sequential basis what drove the improvement quarter-on-quarter. It was lower inventory reserves. Our teams did an outstanding job with respect to component cost performance with our suppliers and in the logistics area. And that kind of came in earlier than we expected. Those are a set of teams that for a couple of years had been working on supply because of COVID and the pandemic. And what happened in terms of supply constraints and those teams in more recent periods have refocused on cost reductions. And we saw that come in early and so we were really pleased to see that. And so great performance in the quarter. You saw us improve the guidance for the year. I would say if we -- as we look at the second half, you will see increased depreciation, as I described. You will see a high proportion of the revenue be new products, da Vinci 5 and Ion and SP. In Q2, all of the 70 da Vinci 5 placements, only 11 of them were purchase arrangement. So kind of a muted effect in terms of gross margin in the quarter. The other placements are operating leases, where you see the economics play out over time.
Travis Steed: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Okay, we'll go to the next line Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Robbie Marcus: Oh, great, thanks and I'll add congratulations on a very solid quarter here. I wanted to ask about the feedback in the field, you talked about in the script a bit. We've all talked to doctors and have heard from them. I'd love to hear from you both what the physicians are saying, but also what the institutions are saying. Clearly, demand is there 70 units this fast is really strong. But what's the pushback, if any, for centers? How do they feel about the ability to drive better economics and faster procedures and better outcomes with da Vinci 5 and the feedback so far from the physicians?
Dave Rosa: Yes, Rob, maybe I'll start. This is Dave. Just starting with some of the feedback that we've discussed before, you look at what customers are immediately appreciating and some of the things you would expect around ergonomics, increases in precision and vision, the head in UI, onscreen graphics and other things. And so taken together, each one of those features are leading to some efficiency gains in particular in sort of console time. And that has been kind of noticed across the customer base. And I think that's where we're starting -- we're hearing a little bit about what can that mean in terms of adding a procedure a day, increasing utilization of the system. And so that's what both our surgeon customers and our executive customers are noticing as a result of their investment in da Vinci 5. You know, some of the other features, Case Insights, Force Feedback, we're excited to work with customers and we know that's going to take time to develop and really quantify some of those impacts. In terms of pushback, today what we are seeing is a little bit what Jamie talked about. We are starting, customers will have to evaluate the value of da Vinci 5. We have these early adopters that are excited about what it can be. And as we move in through our measured launch, we will continue to have to underscore, and reinforce the value that it brings, and communicate that to executives and their teams.
Gary Guthart: I'll just jump in and add a little. We expect to be evaluated against the quadruple or the quintuple aim with regard to da Vinci 5. And we are confident that we are going to get there. I think we are going to develop the data to support that perspective. The apples-to-apples price differences aren't that great once you add inflator, and some of the other things that are built in. We have just got to justify that difference. One of the questions I would ask, and Dave, you can answer it, is are there any procedures that physicians prefer using da Vinci 5 Xi to da Vinci 5? In other words, is there any preference to stay with what they have got?
Dave Rosa: Yes. So, Gary, in all of my discussions and with the team, surgeons prefer the use of da Vinci 5 for the reasons we talked about.
Gary Guthart: So I think on the administrative side, as long as you can demonstrate that the quadruple aim or the quintuple aim is being satisfied, that they are getting value for the relatively modest apples-to-apples price increase, I think we feel pretty good. I would say on force reflection and on case insights, these are powerful foundational new capabilities that are going into the market. And I think that's really interesting. And we'll work with leading customers to start evaluating where do they make sense and where don't they. We of course believe that there are going to be procedures and patient populations where they make a ton of sense and they generate real value. So early, it is about data generation and research and feedback. And later, we will start to drive that through clinical publications and other things. So I think there is a left hand, right hand here. Some of it is what you get today. You get precision, you get imaging, you get ergonomics, you get throughput. There are some things that in this platform you get to participate in its research and development. That will come later. Then it is a core technology platform upon, which we can build. Jamie mentioned it earlier. So it is that set of sequences that gives us some confidence to keep pushing hard.
Robbie Marcus: Well Gary, you anticipated my follow-up question. So let me ask another one here. One of the items of feedback I have heard from physicians is that case insights, and the force sensing can help existing physicians be better. But more importantly, it could help physicians that do a lot of lab procedures or open procedures make it easier for them to adjust to robotics. Is that something you are hearing? I know it is early in the launch here, but how do you think about those features and the ability to get more conversion from lab to robotic?
Dave Rosa: So, I do think there are several ways to consider force feedback and think about it. One of them is, we do think it can have an impact on learning curve. And so as laparoscopic surgeons, or newer surgeons to the platform adopted. We believe that force feedback and looking at force feedback through case insights, can improve their time to proficiency on the robot. When it comes to kind of longer term clinical outcomes and what force feedback and the data surrounding it, it's what Gary described. We believe it to be a powerful component of looking to the future and saying, how do we improve surgical outcomes? Does gentler surgery imparting less force on tissue have a difference in outcomes? Our hypothesis is strongly yes. And so that is what is going to take multiple quarters in time to develop. But I do believe there is kind of two segments where force feedback can have that impact.
Robbie Marcus: Thank you very much.
Operator: And we'll go to the next line. And that is the line of David Roman, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
David Roman: Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to start on an Ion question, appreciating some of the supply chain dynamics that may have contributed positively to growth in the quarter. But maybe you could go into a little bit more detail about what you're seeing in the field from an adoption perspective, to what extent you're seeing higher diagnostic yields on Ion result in earlier intervention for patients and whether those interventions are taking place utilizing da Vinci or not?
Gary Guthart: Yes, so with respect to getting a patient into the diagnostic pipeline, that's kind of an independent variable from Ion and or da Vinci. And so that's through screening or incidental findings. But once they're in there, then Ion is offering really, really effective way to go and biopsy that lesion. And so, we look at kind of two main variables there. One is the size of the lesion, and then one is the diagnostic yield. And so the important part of this, is to diagnose smaller and smaller lesions. Now, the smaller the lesion, it is correlated to cancer stage. And that's where if you get it at stage 1A, you can have very, very high survival. So we're pushing towards smaller lesion size. And then diagnostic yields that are as good as possible, approaching TTNA levels or CT guided biopsy levels, and eventually we hope to exceed those. And so those together, Ion is proving to be a really effective tool at doing that well, while maintaining an improved safety profile over CT guided needle biopsy. And so, when somebody is diagnosed with Ion and it is deemed to be cancer, then oftentimes they may move to a da Vinci procedure. It's really up to the tumor board and that physician about the best way to treat that patient. It may be with da Vinci, it may be with radiation or some other alternative. So oftentimes they're coupled, but not all the time.
David Roman: That's a very helpful context. Thank you. And maybe I could ask a financial question on the follow-up here. I think as I look at the operating expense targets for the year, most of the reduction actually looks like, it stems back to what might have been a slower start to the year. I think you grew OpEx about 7% in Q1 and saw an acceleration here in Q2. But maybe you could just help unpack a little bit about - a little bit of the dynamic underpinning the operating expense growth for the balance of the year. And how we should think about sort of normalized OpEx growth. Is that sort of the seven number where you started the year, kind of the low double-digit number where you're trending now? And then I don't know if you're willing to offer any perspective on the incremental depreciation, but you were kind of in like the $90 million range in Q1, $100 million range, excuse me, in Q1 of this year. Are we talking about a $10 million per quarter increase, $20 million? And any framing you give might be helpful on that side as well?
Jamie Samath: Yes. Quarter-to-quarter, it can be a little lumpy depending on those expenses the kind of - are not consistent across quarters. So I just say if you take the first half, OpEx grew 9%. And you look at the updated guidance, it says the second half grows 11% to 15%, 16-ish percent. So an acceleration in the second half. From a framing perspective, roughly we're looking to maintain R&D about revenue growth and it's been at 11%. Last couple of years, the first half is about 11%. And then you've seen us describe how we've been leveraging enabling functions. In terms of then what the OpEx guidance was on the last call versus what it is today, there are some of those lumpy expenses that are no longer in the year just, because of timing. We have looked at some headcount that we had planned for the year that, we've pushed into 2025. That's really around focus, not around anything other than focus. Where you see opportunities to continue to leverage maybe at greater rates than we expected, then we'll realize those efficiency benefits. But we do expect second half operating expenses to be higher than the first half. And that's primarily driven by depreciation. Not ready to be specific about what the relative increase in depreciation expense is, but it is contemplated in that ramp up in second half operating expenses.
David Roman: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we'll go to the next line. And that will be the line of Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Good afternoon, everybody. Hi, Gary. Hi, Dave. Just - I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about the procedure growth outlook broadly. You gave us - you bumped up the range, and we're very clear about the low-end factors at the low and the high end. But I was just curious, I'm not sure I understand from your perspective. Is our bariatric or GLP-1 pressure is leveling off here? Or have they leveled off? How reasonable is it to think you could get to the upper end? And sort of the same question for the China Asia pressures you talked about as well. Could you just elaborate a little bit on that? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yes. With regard to how to think about the range, I'm going to ask Brian to step in and do that. So Brian, do that, and then we'll come back to talk a little bit about GLP-1s and I'll perhaps take that. And then I think on China, I'll take it to Dave.
Brian King: So Rick, I'm just going to reemphasize, or restate what the range was. So just ramp size 15.5% to 17%, is procedure guidance for the year. At the low end, we're assuming that bariatric procedures continues to soften. We did talk a bit about even last quarter and this quarter in Asia around physician strikes that were impacting procedures in Korea along with delayed tenders, impacting procedure or capital placements in China. Which therefore, impacts overall procedures, or procedure growth. And at the high end of the range, we're really assuming that, that bariatric or bariatric essentially stabilizes at current quarter rates. And again, that Korea and China do not get any worse.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Speaking of bariatrics, two effects are going on. The GLP-1s are changing to the surgical market. And even within that, there is some share change between laparoscopy and robotics that's going on. So you have two things that are coming through and they net out. It is not - the impact of GLP-1s on the bariatric surgery market from our perspective in aggregate has not bottomed yet. And the reality is I don't think anybody knows when and where that will exactly settle for a couple of reasons. I think some of it is looking at the puts and takes of effectiveness, and you have constrained access to the drugs and you have some new drugs in the pipeline. So that will play out over time. And if somebody told you they knew the answer, I'm not sure I believe them. Having said all that, we're not depressed about it. I think that it will play out. I think there's a role for bariatric surgery, and I think in our customers' hands with our systems, I think that surgery has done well. So I think we're just going to have to all go through it together. I think we're going to look that experience together. With regard to kind of longer-term outlook of procedures in China and overall sentiment. Dave, I'll kind of kick to you.
Dave Rosa: Yes. What I would say about the longer-term kind of outlook here is our offerings, when I said before, are highly valued in China. The systems are utilized at a high clip. And we're there's value that surgeons and patients place on high-quality, minimally invasive care. And so that's the, I think, the draw of this. In terms of some of the headwinds and to me, there are kind of two areas. One is the capital environment that we talked about, and with constrained capital environment and placements, it has an impact on procedure growth. And then, there's other areas around this kind of rebasing by the government around economics. And so, it has various impacts. It can have impacts in provinces around charge codes and that is another headwind for us in terms of procedure growth and utilization long-term.
Gary Guthart: One - two comments I'd make on both the headwinds. I think at some point, I'd expect both of them to be time limited. I think there'll be an equilibrium that will be found between GLP-1s and surgery at some point. I also feel like the rebase line in - the economic rebase line in China and the integration and emergence of domestic systems. But those things will start to find an equilibrium also. How long is that going to take, is I think what's underlying this question and the answer is we don't know. But I think that minimally invasive surgery in China is highly valued. There's a belief in robotic-assisted surgery as being important. And our products and ecosystem is valued. So, I think that we're enthusiastic about completing that.
Rick Wise: Yes. Gary, if I could just one follow-up. The question I have gotten, I think, most frequently post the launch of DV5 is what new procedure - what new incremental TAM will da Vinci 5 unlock? I had the privilege of interviewing Dave, who might be near at hand today, that question at SRS. And I said the way da Vinci 5 unlock the general surgery TAM, what will da Vinci 5 unlock and Dave very eloquently said it's going to unlock the routine use of robotic surgery every day. Do you agree with Dave? And is that are your customers understanding that vision, or getting that that's what you're aiming at just any reaction to those thoughts, I'd appreciate it? Thank you, Dave.
Dave Rosa: You're welcome, Rick.
Gary Guthart: Yes. I'll start - good you asked yes, I agree with him. No shock. Maybe just to reiterate our position. There's two different ways that it can help grow long-term. One way is to go deeper into the procedure base, we're in already to help care teams and physicians who have thus far not wanted to adopt, or have chosen not to adopt, or have had a barrier to adoption, to help them adopt. And that can be so - through some of the functionality of DV5 and what it does, a little bit of easier access to other capital for example, of Xis become more used in more places, it can release access constraints together as a portfolio, those are powerful things, and that speaks to what Dave spoke about. We don't think we're done getting additional indications on DV5 and those are things that could happen in the future. And as we get closer and see what those opportunities are, we'll describe them.
Rick Wise: Thank you.
Operator: Okay. We'll go to next line. Drew Ranieri, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Drew Ranieri: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just something that we also heard from SRS was that the DV - da Vinci Xi is still very well considered in the field and there are surgeons that still want to get their hands on it. So just can you talk a little bit more about some of the underlying demand for Xi in the U.S.? And Jamie, I think you pointed out too, that you kind of expect DV5 to sequentially improve throughout the year. So maybe just talk to us about what that means for Xi, given that you're having broader conversations with hospital administrators and surgeons as they're thinking about building capacity for robotic surgery?
Jamie Samath: Yes. I would just say in the U.S., demand for Xi kind of has two segments to it. You have customers that need incremental capacity, da Vinci 5 isn't available in the time that they need it. And so they're entering into arrangements with us, to take Xi now to serve that expansion of capacity they need. And then they have the upgrade right built into the arrangement to move to da Vinci 5 when it becomes available likely in broad launch. You have another segment of customers in the U.S. who are kind of wait and see with respect to, what the value will be of da Vinci 5. And again, they look for building evidence and kind of a broadening of customer belief, and part of that consideration is the profile of that customer, what their strategy is, what their procedure mix is. And of course, as part of the consideration, they're looking at the incremental price, which as Gary described, when you do the full stack isn't actually that significant. But - those customers that have tight capital budgets who like Xi, which is a capable system are more a wait and see. So I think in terms of - as you look forward, that will evolve with respect to how da Vinci capacity expands, and the extent to which then more customers can take that system. But there is a segment of customers that really like Xi.
Drew Ranieri: And has there been any change in thinking about bringing da Vinci 5, to the broader global markets, I know that you're working on a couple of regulatory filings right now, but any update on timing or further market expansion? Thanks for taking the questions.
Jamie Samath: Yes. Just in terms of our OUS plans, I think it's consistent with what we have communicated, which is we're in discussions with Korea and Japan and don't expect to launch in Europe, before the end of next year. And so as we look beyond that, it's just too early to detail out those plans, and we'll let you know as they get a little bit more into focus here.
Operator: Okay. And we'll go to the next line here. Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Adam Maeder: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the nice quarter. Two from me. The first one is on DV5, and I specifically wanted to ask about the hardware and software changes that you plan to make, in the back half of the year. What are you hoping to improve upon? What are the magnitude of the changes that you plan to implement? It sounds like they're relatively minor, but wanted to confirm that. And then I had a follow-up? Thank you.
Dave Rosa: Sure, sure. I'll take that. So some of the near-term additions that we're talking about include the integration of hub capabilities of Intuitive Hub. And then from the surgeon having this head end experience, when they're in the console, they'll be able to start accessing and controlling Intuitive 3D models, being able to manipulate them from the console with the controls there. And also, they'll have the ability to access and replay intraoperative video. And then we'll also include and integrate in simulation. So that kind of gives you a flavor, I think, of some of the pieces that we're adding that we've talked about in these hardware and software upgrades. In addition, there will be some software upgrades that include responding to customer feedback as well. And some of the things that we've heard as we're going through our measured launch here. And then if you look a little further out, some intraoperative technology building blocks that we're working on, such as procedure step mapping and 3D depth mapping that will use some AI and ML algorithms and leverage this compute power of da Vinci 5. And those things will set us up for some more advanced features in the future that leverage that foundation.
Adam Maeder: Highly good color, Dave. Thank you for that and for the follow-up. Wanted to ask about SP. Congrats on the thoracic indication. I'm curious how much you think that expands the opportunity for SP here in the states. I know you're also working on cold erectile, so curious if you have timelines there? And then together, does that kind of give you the indication base to push SP more aggressively in the U.S.? Thanks for taking the questions.
Dave Rosa: Yes. In terms of thoracic, in the early period, that procedure actually is optimal when you have a stapler and we're in development for a stapler for SP. And so, we'll be able to work with early adopters on the thoracic indication. But it's really when the stapler comes that you're able to kind of more robustly drive adoption. One of the advantages of SP is, of course then the opportunity to access the body in ways that, does less damage to healthy tissue. Today in the U.S., in terms of thoracic for multiple, we're already relatively highly penetrated. And so really the question then is relative value of SP compared to Xi. What was the second part of your question? I'm sorry, if you could repeat it?
Adam Maeder: Yes, happy to. I was just asking about colorectal timing. I think you have the IDE study that's ongoing. And I think that will be your fourth indication once the colorectal indication is in hand. So does that kind of give you critical mass from an indication standpoint to kind of push more aggressively with SP in the U.S?
Dave Rosa: Yes. The work on the IDE has progressed. We don't have any additional detail at this point. And obviously, that then adds another category with respect to the set of indications in the U.S. And I think it does have - give us the opportunity to both supplement SP procedure growth in the U.S. And add to the growing utilization we see of the SP platform in the U.S., but I think we also have the opportunity for additional indications over time in the U.S. Colorectal like thoracic will also require the SP stapler.
Gary Guthart: Operator, we'll take one more question from one more call and then we'll wrap.
Operator: Okay. That will be from the line Richard Newitter, Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Jamie, just Jamie in the past, you've talked about a long-term or an intermediate to long-term three, four-year time frame to get back above sustainably 70% gross margin. A, correct me if that's not true, but I'm pretty sure that's what you've said in the past. I'm just curious just with some of the initiatives maybe paying dividends earlier than expected and faster. I know you have some manufacturing transition going on for Ion disposables, that's a big initiative. Is it possible we're moving towards that goal a little faster sooner? I'd love to hear any thoughts there?
Jamie Samath: Specifically, 70% gross margin, that's not sustainable in the shorter term. It continues to be our aspiration to have gross margin at 70% in the medium term. There's work for us to do over that period with respect to obviously da Vince costs. We have to continue to progress on Ion and SP costs. And as we've said, we have incremental depreciation in the second half and more significant incremental depreciation next year. And so that will also require us to then manufacturing capacity related, which you build in chunks. We'll have to revenue leverage that incremental depreciation over a period of time. Certainly in terms of the baseline of where we are at, the cost reductions we described on component costs, and logistic costs have come in a little earlier and that's why we've raised the guidance, for gross margin for this year. But the aspiration for 70% gross margin is still a medium-term aspiration.
Dave Rosa: Thanks. In fact, if I could just maybe -- okay...
Gary Guthart: I'll wrap it there. Thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we believe that there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have now termed the quintupling, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, better access to great care and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision the future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking to you again in three months.
Operator: Thank you, everyone, for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect at this time. Have a good day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-18 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you everyone for standing by and welcome to the Intuitive Q1 2024 Earnings Release Call. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder today’s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical, Brian King. Please go ahead.
Brian King: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive’s first quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our CEO, and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the events section under our investor relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarters business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2024. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. The first quarter of 2024 was a solid one for Intuitive, where core measures of our business remained healthy, including solid procedure growth and capital placements. Furthermore, our teams delivered important milestones across several parts of our Intuitive ecosystem, including launching our next generation of multi-port platform, da Vinci 5, launching our da Vinci SP platform in Europe, and improving our supply constraints for ion catheters. Some regional challenges existed in the quarter which we'll describe today. Taken together we remain enthusiastic about our opportunity and we'll work through near-term pressures by focusing on what we can control. Starting first with procedures, we experienced solid growth in the quarter of 16%, compared with a strong Q1 of ‘23, that was a result of elevated patient volume from the return of patients post-pandemic. Q1 of 2024, procedure performance was led by broad growth and general surgery in the United States and by procedures beyond urology outside the United States. Globally, cholecystectomy, colon resection, and foregut procedures led the way. Regional performance included strength in China, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In Japan, we saw a moderation of growth in urology as we reached higher levels of penetration, and Q1 2023 benefited from the return of patients and backlog. In Korea, growth was lower than our expectation, primarily due to a physician strike in the country, which began in February and has continued. Turning to capital, we placed 313 da Vinci systems in the quarter, of which 289 were multi-port systems, compared with 302 multi-port systems in Q1 of ‘23. SP placements were 24 in the quarter versus 10 systems a year ago, and Ion placements for the quarter were 70 versus 55 a year ago. Capital placements were solid in the United States, our global distribution markets, and in Germany. Placements in China appear to be impacted by delayed tenders and an apparent increase in provincial preference for domestic robotic competition. We saw some placement weakness in the U.K. as financial pressures in the NHS constrained access to capital. System utilization defined as procedures per installed system per quarter grew 1% globally year-over-year for our multi-port platform, lower than last quarter and our historical trend, a result of a strong placement year in 2023 in which the multi-port clinical install base grew 14%, while customers addressed a COVID-related backlog. For our newer platforms, utilization grew 10% for SP and 14% for ION in the quarter. Utilization is an important indicator of customer health and is a reflection of customers driving value from their systems. Turning to our finances, revenue growth of 11% in the quarter reflects solid procedure performance and capital placements. Average system selling prices declined modestly due to regional and product mix. Product margins were within our expectations, reflecting a higher mix of newer platforms. Operating expenses came in slightly below planned, resulting in pro forma operating profit growth of 18%. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call. In the quarter, we made good progress with our new platforms. In March, we received FDA clearance for our next generation multi-port platform, da Vinci 5. Within the quarter, we placed eight da Vinci 5 systems and surgeon completed the first cases. As we engage with customers during their activation of da Vinci 5, our customers are noting and appreciating improved precision, improved imaging, improved efficiency for surgeon and staff, improved ergonomics, and they are exploring the potential of force feedback where early surgeons are excited to test hypothesis about its procedural, clinical, and learning value. Digital analytical capabilities of da Vinci 5 are also drawing positive reviews. In parallel with customer support, we're working hard to optimize our supply chains and manufacturing capabilities for DaVinci 5 components. We will remain in our measured rollout as we stabilize supply and respond to customer input. Turning to Ion, our teams have made meaningful progress on resolving supply challenges for our catheter and Ion's vision probe, although work still remains to be done. Earlier this month, FDA reviewed our set of design and production changes and cleared an increase in an Ion catheter lives from five lives to eight lives, alleviating some supply constraints, while improving the economics for us and our customers. Also in March, we received NMPA clearance for Ion in China through a special review process for innovative medical devices. While NMPA clearance is only the first step toward commercialization in China, we believe Ion can play an important role in helping to address the significant burden of lung cancer in the country. Turning to SP, we received CE Mark in Europe with a broad set of indications in the quarter, and we placed eight systems. First cases in Europe were performed this April and were encouraged by early customer interest for SP. In closing, for 2024, our priorities are as follows. First, we'll support the measured launch of da Vinci 5 and our other new platforms by region. Second, we're focused on supporting surgeons' adoption of focus procedures. Third, we're focused on improving our product margins and quality. And finally, we're focused on improving productivity in those functions that benefit from global scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie who will take you through our finances in greater detail.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or proforma basis. And we'll also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our proforma and GAAP results is posted on our website. In Q1, da Vinci procedures grew 16%. The installed basis systems grew 14% to 8,887 systems. And average system utilization increased by 2%, lower than recent trends because of the strength in procedure growth and utilization in Q1 of last year that reflected a significant benefit from the treatment of patient backlogs. U.S. procedures grew 14%, driven by broad growth in general surgery. Bariatrics procedure growth in the U.S. continued to moderate and was flat year-over-year. OUS procedures grew 20%, reflecting strong growth in general surgery and thoracic procedures. Brian will provide additional detail on our clinical performance later in the call. Turning to capital, we placed 313 systems in the first quarter, compared to 312 systems in Q1 of last year. Excluding trading transactions, net new system placements grew 16% to 284 systems. In the U.S., we placed 148 systems in Q1, including eight da Vinci 5 placements, compared with 141 systems placed in Q1 of last year. Given constrained supply of da Vinci 5, system placements may be choppy this year as some customers that are interested in da Vinci 5 decide whether to acquire a fourth generation system with an upgrade rate or wait for adequate supply. Outside the U.S., we placed 165 systems in Q1, compared with 171 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 84 into Europe, 20 into Japan, and 10 into China, compared with 101 into Europe, 16 into Japan, and 18 into China in Q1 of last year. Placements in the U.K. were below our expectations and lower than Q1 last year, because of the reallocation of NHS Capital Funding to help address industrial actions in the NHS. Placements in China continue to reflect the impact of domestic robotic competition and delayed tenders due to a broader central government focus on systematic governance across sectors, including healthcare. First quarter revenue was $1.89 billion, an increase of 11% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 12%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Leasing represented 51% of Q1 placements, compared with 42% in Q1 of last year. Given customer preference for our usage-based models in the U.S. and the launch of da Vinci 5, we continue to expect the proportion of systems placed under lease arrangements to grow over time. Q1 system average selling prices were $1.39 million as compared to $1.47 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by regional and platform mix and lower pricing in China, partially offset by lower trade-ins. We recognized $29 million of leased buyout revenue in the first quarter, compared with $21 million last quarter and $24 million last year. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,780, flat to last year and down $20, compared to the last quarter. The sequential decline in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of procedure mix in the U.S., given strong growth in cholecystectomy and the moderation of growth in bariatrics. We have also seen larger IDNs in the U.S. look for operational efficiencies by reducing inventory. Turning to Ion. There were approximately 19,500 Ion procedures in the first quarter, an increase of 90% as compared to last year. Since launching the Ion platform in 2019, on a cumulative basis, more than 100,000 procedures have now been performed. In Q1, we placed 70 Ion systems compared to 55 in Q1 of 2023 and 44 last quarter. Q1 results reflected a partial recovery from last quarter, as catheter supply improved. Our team continued to work on stabilizing supply of the catheter and vision probe. Q1 results included four Ion system placements in the U.K., following the European clearance last year. The installed base of Ion systems increased 61% year-over-year to 604 systems, of which 244 are under operating lease arrangements. 24 of the systems placed in the quarter were SP systems, including eight systems in Europe, reflecting clearance early in the quarter. First quarter SP procedure growth was 60%, with healthy growth in Korea and the U.S., and early-stage growth in Japan. In the U.S., during the quarter, we completed a 510(k) submission for a thoracic indication, made continued regulatory progress toward a colorectal submission and enrolled additional patients in our IDE for nipple-sparing mastectomy. The SP installed base grew 55% from the year-ago quarter to 201 systems. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 67.6%, compared with 67.2% for the first quarter of 2023 and 68% last quarter. The sequential reduction in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects higher fixed costs, including depreciation expense for expanded manufacturing capacity and higher costs associated with the launch of da Vinci 5. Our manufacturing and business unit teams made progress in the quarter on activities to improve gross margin over the medium term. This remains an area of key focus for us. First quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 7%, compared with last year, slightly lower than our -- than expectations due to the timing of certain expenses. Pro forma operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 140 basis points lower than Q1 last year, reflecting planned leverage in enabling functions, partially offset by increased R&D to fund innovation and future growth. Pro forma other income was $72.5 million for Q1, higher than $67.1 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations. First quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $544 million or $1.50 per share, compared with $444 million or $1.23 per share for the first quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $547 million, or $1.51 per share for the first quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $361 million, or $1.00 per share for the first quarter of 2023. First quarter GAAP tax expense was a benefit of $9 million, reflecting excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans of $111 million. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website, and include excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges, and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.3 billion, flat to the end of last year. The sequential changes in cash included cash generated from operating activities, offset by capital expenditures of $242 million and the net impact of employee equity plans of $46 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian.
Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Overall, first quarter procedure growth was 16% year-over-year, compared to 26% for the first quarter of 2023 and 21% last quarter. In the U.S., first quarter 2024 procedure growth was 14% year-over-year, compared to 26% for the first quarter of 2023 and 17% last quarter. First quarter growth was led by procedures within general surgery with strength in cholecystectomy, colon resection and foregut procedures. Growth in bariatrics procedures continued to moderate and was flat year-over-year. Outside of the U.S., first quarter procedure volume grew 20%, compared with 28% for the first quarter of 2023 and 29% last quarter. Over 70% of procedure volume growth led by procedures beyond urology with strength in colon resection, hysterectomy, and lung resection procedures. In Europe, first quarter growth continued to be led by general surgery and gynecology procedure categories. Germany and the U.K. procedure performance led the region with both experiencing strong growth in colon and rectal resection and hysterectomy procedures. In Asia, growth in the first quarter was led by China with strong procedure performance in urology and gynecology procedures. Year-over-year procedure growth in the country benefited from a comparison period where procedures were beginning to recover from COVID during the first quarter of 2023. In Japan, while we experienced a moderation in growth in urology, overall procedure growth was healthy, with strength in general surgery procedures such as colon and rectal resection and gynecology procedures. Effective June 1, 2024, five additional procedures will have reimbursement in Japan, with two existing rectal resection procedures receiving an increase in reimbursement for equivalency to laparoscopic surgery. The opportunity for these procedures is relatively modest, but continues to support the adoption of minimally invasive robotic surgery across a growing set of procedures. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. In the first quarter of this year, Dr. J. John Choi and team from University of South Florida and Tampa, Florida published a meta-analysis of randomized control trials describing outcomes of robotic assisted abdominal pelvic surgery in the journal of surgical endoscopy. This analysis included a review of 50 publications published through April 2021, included over 4,800 patients from randomized control studies, and covered a variety of abdominal pelvic surgical procedures, including anti-reflex, gastrointestinal, colorectal, urologic, hernia repair, and gynecologic procedures. The authors compared robotic assisted outcomes with those from both open and laparoscopic procedures. When compared to the open approach, robotic assisted procedures had lower rates of post-operative complications, with a 32% lower risk of post-operative complications across all procedures, as well as less estimated blood loss, with a mean difference of 286.8 milliliters. Furthermore, length of stay was on average 1.7 days shorter for robotic assisted procedures. Relative to the laparoscopic approach, rates of conversion to open for the robotic assisted group was approximately half the rate of the laparoscopic approach. Length of stay was also shorter for robotic assisted procedures. Interestingly the authors also reported an analysis on the impact of surgeon experience comparing inexperienced versus experienced surgeons and found that the experienced robotic-assisted surgeons had a lower risk of intraoperative complications with significantly less risk in the experienced group, as compared with the laparoscopic group, as well as a lower risk of conversion to open for the experienced surgeon relative to the laparoscopic group, with comparable operative times compared to laparoscopy with experienced surgeons. The authors concluded, in part, that their results suggest robotic surgery may shorten length of stay and rates of conversion to open when compared to laparoscopy, with experience mitigating potential differences in operating time, while improving rates of intraoperative complications and conversions to open surgery. In March this year, Dr. Nicole Linares from the University of Texas Southwestern, along with colleagues from other hospitals and data support from the Intuitive Health Economics Outcomes Research Team, reported outcomes describing the use of robotic technology in emergency general surgery cases. Published in JAMA Surgery, this analysis used the PINC AI Healthcare Database, a database that collects data from over 800 facilities to identify adult patients undergoing urgent or emergent cholecystectomy, colectomy, inguinal and ventral hernia repairs between 2013 and 2021. For reference, emergent procedures were described as those required for life threatening or potentially disabling conditions, while urgent procedures were those where immediate intervention was needed and prioritized as first available. Over 1 million urgent or emergent procedures were identified. During the study period, the use of robotic assisted surgery for all procedures experienced a 3.5-fold increase in cholecystectomy, a 6-fold increase for colectomy, and 38-fold increase in inguinal hernia repairs. Notably, increases in the robotic assisted approach corresponded to decreases in the open approach for these procedures, as well as a decrease in laparoscopy for cholecystectomy and colectomy procedures. Furthermore, a propensity score matched analysis demonstrated a lower risk of conversion to open for the robotic assisted approach, when compared to laparoscopy. Cholecystectomy procedures with a 45% lower risk of conversion, colectomy with a 63% lower risk, inguinal hernia repair with a 79% lower risk, and ventral hernia repair with a 70% lower risk of conversion. The authors concluded “the application of robotic surgery and emergency general surgery has steadily increased in the past decade, which is especially useful in older patients with several comorbidities. As observed in this cohort study, compared with laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery appears to have resulted in lower rates of conversion to open surgery from 2013 to 2021. Robotic surgery also leads to a shorter or comparable postoperative length of stay in the hospital. Nevertheless, open surgery remains a key component for most emergency general surgery. As robotic surgery continues to increase in emergency general surgery, barriers to implementation need to be addressed and optimized through coordinated efforts across stakeholders” I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full-year 2024 procedure growth within a range of 13% and 16%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full-year 2024 procedure growth of 14% to 17%. The low-end of the range assumes further weakness in bariatrics procedures, along with challenges in China from increasing provincial robotic competition and delayed tenders impacting capital placements and therefore procedure growth. We also assume there is no benefit of patient backlog in the year. At the high-end of the range, we assume bariatrics continues at flat to slightly positive growth rates, and factors in China don't have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we assume any backlog of patients would decline throughout the year. Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 67% and 68% of net revenue. Pro forma gross profit margin in 2024 reflects the impact of growth in our newer products da Vinci 5, Ion and SP, and the impact of capital investments that will come on to support the growth of our business. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional, and trade in mix and the impact of new product mix. Turning to operating expenses, we are holding our guidance for performance operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. We continue to expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $680 million to $710 million in 2024. We are holding our guidance for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $290 million and $320 million in 2024. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for plan facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, there is no change to our guidance of 2024 pro forma income tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to the first question at this time and that's from Robbie Marcus, JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Robbie Marcus: Oh, great. And congrats on a very nice quarter. Gary, I was hoping you could touch on, you know, what surprised me the most was the procedure volume off a really difficult quarter here 16%. Maybe walk us through your view of what's driving it? Obviously, you gave color on some of the procedures, but it's a really strong number, and what gives you the confidence that it's sustainable with the raise guidance through the rest of the year?
Gary Guthart: Yes, I'm going to turn that first question over to Jamie. Thanks Marcus. Jamie why don't you go and then I'll add a few thoughts thereafter.
Jamie Samath: Yes where we saw particular strength regionally was in the U.S. and the U.K. in particular. What you also see in OUS markets, as Brian described, is this continuing growth in procedures beyond urology. That first is focused on cancer procedures, colorectal thoracic, hysterectomy, some early stage growth in benign in our international markets. So the combination of those things, I think, were behind the performance in Q1. And as you kind of look at then the inputs from the teams, as we get feedback from our customers, I think then we kind of reflect that in the rest of the guidance. Obviously, the guidance is only up a point at the low and the high end of the range, so something we're watching carefully.
Gary Guthart: So, I think, Jamie, you got it.
Robbie Marcus: Maybe just as a quick follow-up, I'm at the SAGES conference now and, you know, the doctor feedback is phenomenal on da Vinci 5 from our end and the doctors we spoke to. I was hoping you could just give us some early feedback on what you've heard across the field. Doctors' willingness and hospitals’ willingness to not just add new systems, but upgrade the fleet and just what you've been hearing? Thanks a lot.
Gary Guthart: Yes, in terms of early feedback, we’re hearing, I think what we were hoping for in terms of our design intent. They're appreciating the improvements to precision and imaging, to workflow and the team's efforts on human factors design and user interface, strong commentary on ergonomics, and I think force feedback is something that is new and will create opportunities to really understand the clinical implications of force application during surgery. I think that will be exciting and powerful over time. I think it's really hard for us, sitting where we are today, to predict the depth and timing of a replacement cycle. We're excited. I think that folks are excited about what's the potential of the product. That said, Xi is great. Xi has a lot of clinical indications, and we're going to have some supply constraints here as we work through our launch. Jamie, I don't know if there's anything you'd like to add to that.
Jamie Samath: Nope, I think you got it Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Robbie.
Operator: Okay, we'll go to the next line, Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: [Technical Difficulty] for taking the question. I echo Robbie, congratulations on a nice quarter here. Just two on da Vinci 5 for me. Maybe starting with Gary, the supply constraints, when do you expect those to be resolved? How long into 2025 will the limited launch last and what will trigger the full launch?
Gary Guthart: Yes, thanks. Larry, there's three things that are going on for us. One of them is optimizing the supply chain, get -- making sure that we have the quality that we want that will for sure go through all of ‘24 in some part of the early part of ’25, so that's one. The second thing is -- we want to incorporate feedback from our customers. We want to make sure that we're adjusting the things that we need to adjust to make sure that they're highly satisfied. And then the last thing is we have additional feature content and hardware improvements and other things that are planned that our design teams are going to execute on, whether it's software or other updates or some of the things we can do in imaging that we want to do as we bring it through. So it's kind of a three-part set of activities, and we think it's pretty well planned out. I wouldn't expect big changes from our plan, and if there are changes in the future, then we'll be sure to talk about them.
Larry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And Gary, you haven't been specific about new indications that da Vinci 5 could open, but can you help us understand what the features are of da Vinci 5 that could allow physicians to do new procedures and why? Thanks for taking the question.
Gary Guthart: Yes, our first thought here and bringing the system to market has been to allow surgeons to go deeper into the existing indications we have already. So the indications for da Vinci 5 largely mirror the Xi index indications that we had already. But we do think that it will invite new surgeons and care teams into robotic assisted surgery. I think it allows us to deepen our relationship with that customer base, and we're excited about it. In terms of core capabilities, da Vinci 5 has some really core things. Better imaging that right now, today, it's better, and will get better over time. Precision and high performance and tracking performance allows for really subtle and fine surgical motions. And we think that's really powerful in its core. It's a core capability. Faster workflow opens new opportunities for people, too. So we do think there are additional clinical indications we can pursue. We are evaluating them. We have not finalized on everything yet. And likely they will require conversations with FDA. So we're not prepared at this time to tell you what they might be, but as we get a little closer and work through it then we'll describe it once we've settled our approach.
Operator: And we will go to the next line Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Travis Steed: I wanted to ask a little bit more color on the strong Xi placements in the capital environment even ahead of the dV 5 launch. And it sounded like the message changed on system placements in 2023 or 2024. I think before it was system placements could be lower in 2024, and now it's just choppy. So does that mean there's a chance that system placements are up in 2024?
Jamie Samath: Yes, I mean…
Gary Guthart: Jamie, why don't I.
Jamie Samath: Oh, go ahead, Gary.
Gary Guthart: No, Jamie, go ahead and take it, apologies.
Jamie Samath: Yes. I think the first dynamic is trading-ins. Given the limited supply in dV 5, those placements will be, during the measured launch, focused on incremental placements. So not a lot of trade activity coming from dV 5. And if you look at what's left in the install base for our third gen SI, you've got about 350 systems globally, of which 50 are in the U.S. So we do expect trading volumes to be down quite a bit in ‘24. With respect to overall system placements, I know we made the comments on the last call, but generally we don't guide system placements, so we'll let you run that through your models given the updated procedure guidance. But certainly we've acknowledged that placements could be choppy, while we're constrained on dv 5. In Q1, we didn't really see any customers pushing back on I don't want an Xi, we want to wait for dV 5. But since the launch, which obviously was only in March, we've had our Connect conference, we've had SAGES this week, a significant number of surgeons and executives have now seen dV 5 put their hands on it. So we're acknowledging that customers may choose to wait. We don't have enough evidence or indication yet to see which way that will go.
Travis Steed: Great. Maybe, Gary, you could spend some time, just kind of a bigger picture question on dV 5 and the capabilities it brings to training, being able to practice some of the edge cases, helping with proctoring. I'm just curious how you see the impact on robotic surgery adoption and driving better outcomes from some of those dV 5 training capabilities that's going to roll out and how long some of this stuff actually is going to take?
Gary Guthart: In terms of raw capability, I think that it will help care teams acquire skills more quickly and it also helps them in the case. As you can kind of think of that as contact sensitive help. The device is kind of aware of where it is and what it's doing and can share that information with the care team, so that as they're doing things, whether it's changing tools or setting it up, it provides real-time help to help guide them through it. And I think that's a really good thing. It just makes it easier to use. Our Intuitive hub has integration, technologies that start with da Vinci 5 and will get better over time as we release software updates and hardware updates. And so that starts to close an analytical loop for our customers from what they're seeing in the case to video review to video analytics to feeding back information to their phones and their laptops and whatever their means are consuming that data is. So that gives them an analytical loop, which should also help. And we'll also continue to evolve our simulation training and some of our other packages, our online learning, that will help them as well. So I think all of this is going to take a little bit of time, but I think the design concept, I think our designers did a beautiful job. I think the design concept of integrating these ideas, making it easy for care teams, for surgeons to follow that journey should help us. Final point I'll make is that in our labs and during our early experience with da Vinci 5, it looks like forced reflection helps novice, new to robotics, new to robotics assistant surgery, require their skills faster. So it should invite more surgeons in and ease their journey. It remains to be proven. It's not done and done, but we think it's encouraging. And so stay tuned. I think keep asking that question and as the data starts to come out, we'll be pleased to share it with you.
Travis Steed: Great. We will wait to see and congrats.
Operator: Okay, and we'll go to the next line. Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Good afternoon. Hi, Gary. Maybe it would be helpful to hear in a little more detail your thoughts on a couple of points that maybe some of the headwinds. Bariatrics flat year-over-year, I wasn't sure completely what I was hearing about trends. Is it getting worse still? Does the -- is the rate of pressure easing? I appreciate in talking about the guidance you talked about, a range, given the range of outcomes, but I assure make sure I understood what you are seeing?
Gary Guthart: Yes, let me share my perspective. Rick, thanks for the question, and then Brian, I'll kick it to you to talk about the range. I think what we can tell you is what we see and what we've seen is continued deceleration such that it's flat year-over-year. There are a lot of opinions out in the field and we can all talk to them. I think the reality is nobody really knows yet. We're going to have to look through it together and as a result it's going to be dynamic. We do know that bariatric surgery is well tolerated and it's a good option and we also know that people are interested in pharmaceuticals and that the pharmaceuticals work as long as you take them for a subset of the population and then stop working if you don't. What that means for future surgery, I think there's a range of opinions and I would not hang a lot of confidence on any of them just yet. And that's why we have a range. And Brian, perhaps you can just touch on how you see bariatric surgery affecting the range. Just reiterate that, if you would.
Brian King: Sure. And just to reiterate again, the low end of the range assumes that there's further weakness in bariatric procedures, right? So at the low end of the range, further weakness in bariatric procedures. At the high end of the range, we assume that bariatrics continues at flat to slightly positive growth rates. And I think, again, to Gary's point, it will be dynamic and we're just going to have to see how it plays out throughout the year.
Rick Wise: Okay, great. And let me turn to some of the new and incremental features you talked about, Gary. I'm sure all of us on the call have been talking to doctors. I've been hearing a variety of additional features. Some sound quite compelling. Can you give us any flavor? I mean, first, I'd be happy to hear from you what some of them could be? But how quickly, given what you know today, when could we see those features that, again, I would assume would enhance the value? Are we going to see them this year, second-half, or is it more likely that's something for next year as you get supply chain where you want it to be? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yes, I think as we add capabilities and time, we have some imaging things that we want to do. We have some things in terms of software upgrades and analytics power and some things we want to do in terms of integration. That's much more likely to be ‘25 and later than ‘24. A lot of ‘24 will be making sure that we and our suppliers feel great about what we've got and then adapting to any immediate feedback that we see.
Operator: And we will go to the next line. Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Adam Maeder: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions, and congrats on the nice quarter. I wanted to start by asking about the force feedback instruments. I was hoping, Gary, you could share a little bit more color on the feedback that you're getting from clinicians thus far into launch? And then if I understand correctly, you have six force feedback instruments that are used across different common procedures. Will you look to expand the portfolio of that technology going forward? And if so, what might that look like? And then I had a follow-up, thank you.
Gary Guthart: Sure, we're getting a variety of feedback on the instruments themselves. Just a reminder for everyone, they have very sensitive sensors that are built into the distal end, in the body end of the instruments that are sterilizable and cleanable, and they report back contact forces with tissue which at a sensitive way, which has been a goal for us and for surgery for a long time. So it's a hard technology, we've been really excited to bring it to market. We will hear everything from, hey, I'm getting great results with da Vinci X and Xi today, that has very limited version of haptics. It really doesn't have in-body sensing. It does have a little something, but it's not sensing in the technical sense. And that's true, they're getting great results. So it's a new sense. That said, people are quite interested to explore where it will take them. And what's interesting is that when you're using a force sensing instrument, it's sensing whether you turn on force reflection into the surgeon's hands or not. So the surgeon can feel it, they can turn it on, or they can turn it off, but still measure so that they have the feeling experience of an X or an Xi. And what they find when they turn it on and off is that the amount of force that they apply during surgery to tissue decreases when force reflection into the hands is on. And so the big question is what's the clinical value of that? What will be the implications for patient outcomes by procedure and by technique? And that's what they're going to go explore and we will help them do that exploration. So now we're talking about the future, what could happen. I suspect, I believe, this is a personal opinion. There will be types of procedures and types of patients where having lower force applied to tissue during the surgery is going to be clinically meaningful. And we have to go prove that. So I think it's quite interesting. The technology is sophisticated. We are with our manufacturing partners learning how to make these at scale with good yield and robust. It's a worthy endeavor, but it is not easy and we're going to focus on it, make sure that we get what we want. We want to make sure we have robust and high yield products, we want to extend their lives to help the economics of our customers and our economics. So that is our first focus. As to the six instruments, I'm going look to Jamie as to whether the sixth number is right, I think it is. Certainly over time, we have the opportunity to extend it to other instruments. But that first set of six are the ones that we thought were right. Six is the right number, Jamie?
Jamie Samath: It is, and it's a combination of graspers and needle drivers, and those instruments are used in very common tasks, dissection, retraction and suturing.
Adam Maeder: Thanks Adam.
Operator: Alright, we'll go to the next line Drew Ranieri, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Drew Ranieri: Thank you taking the questions, maybe just on SP for a moment with the indication expansion in Europe. Can you talk about that a bit more, Gary? And I was hearing from a surgeon today that the CRSA Conference in November in Rome could be pretty important for just getting broader adoption from European surgeons, but does that inform how you could approach the U.S. market with a broader indication? And then I just had a follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Yes, yes, I'm actually here in Europe, have been for the last couple of weeks talking to SP surgeons here, I think the early uptake and early excitement is quite palpable. Where we've had broad indications, as you know, in Korea and now Japan, we've seen a nice uptake in adoption and good study, good clinical study. And I think that the surgeons here are building on that. They're learning from and adapting what they see in the rest of the world and getting excited about it. So I'm encouraged. How deep that goes? It's still early days here in Europe, we will see. But we're starting to see fairly long case studies in things like colorectal surgery coming out of Asia and other places. We have submitted, as Jamie had mentioned, for an additional indication in the United States, we have another one coming. We have IDE trials ongoing. So we have some national experiments to see what occurs. We know the experiment in Korea has worked out well. We're in process in Japan and now we're in the early experience for broad indications in Europe. That should help us generate data and accelerate additional indications over time in the U.S. And I have to say, I think It remains a build for SP, but I'm encouraged by the build.
Drew Ranieri: Thank you. And maybe this is more for Jamie, but Jamie, could you talk about the commentary about lower pricing in China for the quarter? Just talk about that a little bit more and maybe put that into context on if this is temporary, if it's permanent or more to come and just the overall competitive situation in China would be great. Thank you.
Jamie Samath: Yes, it's primarily a function of the competitive environment we've described with the domestic robotic players. What we actually have now given last year, we qualified a domestically manufactured Xi is actually some segmentation between the domestically manufactured product and an imported product. And the domestic product gives us the opportunity to both participate in tenders that require a locally produced system, but also allows us to segment on price. But the primary impact on China pricing is really competition. And you kind of see that theme broadly with other MedTech players in terms of the impact of VBP. It doesn't apply in this case, but kind of the macro theme of pricing pressure does.
Operator: And we'll go to the next line. And that will be Matt Miksic, Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matt Miksic: Hey, Thanks so much for taking the questions and congrats on a really strong quarter against [Indiscernible]. So a couple of follow-ups, if I could on a couple of things that you mentioned, Gary, in your last answer around force feedback and sort of the clinical impacts of optimizing or reducing the force used during surgery, which is kind of buzzing around here at SAGES quite a bit this year in the sessions? And I'm wondering, you know, appreciate always the data that you talk about during the prepared remarks and recent clinical data. I'm wondering, you know, how far out are we going to see, you know, clinical reference like that to studies around the use of force feedback versus not, and also maybe efficiencies driven by a lot of the docs you're talking about, smoother operating arms and being able to get through cases faster. You know, is that a year out, are we six months, are we two years out for dV 5 research like that? And again, appreciate you taking the question.
Gary Guthart: Yes, it's a good question, Thank you. This is approximate, not specific, so take it with some error bars. But, you know, I think what you're going to see in force feedback study is going to be a progression. You'll see narrow series, single institution studies come out first that are kind of directional. They talk about what they're seeing in their own, and then you'll see a little bit, and that should be the kind of thing that comes out in the next 12 months. And then over the next period after that, over the next couple of years, you'll see multiple center trials that are comparing in a little more structured way. So I think you can predict the path of the journey, but I think this is something that you're going to see from narrower input to start to broader input in the next year to prospective studies that start to report over the next year after that. So I think it's a build, but I think it's going to be a powerful build in the end. I think with regard to efficiencies, we're hearing anecdotal reports already that the surge in autonomy features that are in da Vinci, the ability for them to control their own field and to control the equipment, the Hansler equipment in the room has been really positive and they're reporting efficiencies already. I think real-world evidence is going to be powerful on the efficiency side. I think that's the kind of thing that people can benchmark their own cases. We also our data collection capabilities between Intuitive Hub and the My Intuitive app allow them to measure that very quickly. So I think you'll see the real-world evidence of that build and it will be in the coming months and quarters and that will be exciting for us.
Matt Miksic: That's great. Thank you.
Operator: And we will go to the next line. Let's go to the line, Brandon Vazquez, William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon Vazquez: Thanks for taking the question. I want to focus on Ion real quick. You had a nice rebound in the quarter there after some supply last quarter? Just curious, do you see a little bit of catch up there or not? And then even as these numbers are getting bigger, you're still putting up some really strong growth? So, curious where you're seeing the most growth there, new accounts or existing utilization and how sustainable you think it is?
Gary Guthart: Jamie, why don't you take that one?
Jamie Samath: Yes, I'd say it was a partial recovery in the quarter -- we haven't completely resolved both catheter supply and the vision probe. We still have a little bit of backlog in terms of number of systems that's pending, kind of, stabilization of that supply. With respect to where are we placing those systems, it's actually a blend between existing accounts and new accounts. We still have a number of opportunities for what I call green field accounts. So both are a focus for the sales team.
Brandon Vazquez: Okay, and one quick follow-up maybe on the surgical side. The 1% utilization growth, I appreciate it, off of a tough comp and we're kind of normalizing. But I think we kind of, we usually use utilization growth as an indication for system placements and then it implies a certain procedure growth as well. Just talk to us a little bit about what you kind of think a below historical average utilization growth in the quarter might mean for those key moving pieces in the next couple of quarters. Thanks.
Jamie Samath: Yes, I mean -- go ahead, Gary.
Gary Guthart: I'll jump in and then Jamie take it. I think that in the prepared remarks, we had said you had a nice capital placement year and we had a bolus of post-COVID comeback into Q1. I think the uncertainty part of this is really just going to be what the inpatient volumes look like in the next quarters of 2024. In other words, just the patient census as it comes through. But you're right, I think that it's an indicator of capacity. So depending what that patient census looks like, that'll determine the high end and the low end of utilization growth in terms of how many procedures people want to put on those systems. Sorry Jamie, go ahead, you might discuss the modeling there.
Jamie Samath: I would just say that if you look at Q1 utilization over an extended period, look at what the CAGR is versus the year-over-year comparison, you see that stuff to be in a more normal range of 3% to 4%. I do think that in the year ago quarter, you had a number of institutions that actually stepped themselves up to do sprints with respect to their ability to treat patients. And so I do think that was elevated and at that level of utilization growth of 13%, it wasn't particularly sustainable. So as I look forward to the rest of the year, I'd expect some levels of utilization growth that let's say are closer to our long-term averages. There's still some patient backlog benefit in the year-ago quarters, even in Q2 and Q3. So it's not perfectly matched, but I think there's room for normalization over time.
Operator: And we will go to the next question from the line of Jayson Bedford to Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Jayson Bedford: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe Ion in China, obviously a large opportunity there. Just a couple questions, and I apologize if I missed this, but does Ion fall within the existing robotics quota? And then for Ion, you mentioned clearance is the first step? Can you just talk through the other steps to commercialization and associated timing of those steps? Thanks.
Jamie Samath: Yes, we have some work to put eye on at a point where it's actually available to sell, so that will take us some time. We're not expecting to have commercialization really until the back half of 2024. And China is a market where, like many cases, when we launch a new product in a market, we do that progressively as we kind of build our infrastructure in terms of training capabilities and engage with customers. So I'd say back up at ‘24 is when you start to see the potential for Ion placements in China.
Jayson Bedford: On the issue of is it competing for the same quota, Jamie?
Jamie Samath: Oh, sorry. Yes, our understanding is it is not in the quota given the price.
Jayson Bedford: Thank you.
Gary Guthart: And Jason, if you have one more follow-up, that will wrap it up for us.
Jayson Bedford: No, that's fine. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Okay, that was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians, and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim. Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: And thank you everyone for joining today's conference call. That does indeed conclude your conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-23 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you everyone for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Brian King. Please go ahead.
Brian King: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive’s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our CEO, and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2023, and Form 10-Q filed on October 20, 2023. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the events section under our investor relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our full year and fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our financial outlook for 2024. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. I'll touch on our performance last quarter and for the full year 2023 and share our perspective on 2024. The past year was a good one for Intuitive with use of our platforms growing nicely, hospitals building additional system capacity to support that growth and increased average utilization per system per year for each of our platforms. Our teams have been delivering to meet customer demand, driving quality and availability improvements, running clinical trials and readying new products and services for the market. We'll touch on a few of those efforts on this call. Starting first with procedures, growth for the full year was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States and regional performance in countries including Germany, France, the UK, and Ireland to name a few. In the US, general surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy with foregut procedures rising as well. Colon and hernia procedure growth was also healthy for the year. Bariatric procedures grew year-over-year. However, we saw continued deceleration of growth throughout 2023, likely the result of the uptake of GLP-1 drugs for obesity. Procedure growth outside the United States diversified beyond urology with nice growth in categories including gynecology and general surgery. In flexible robotics, ion procedures showed continued strength with 129% growth for the full year. SP procedure growth was accretive in the year with 48% growth over full year driven by acceleration in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 1,313 multi-port systems in the full year of ‘23, compared with 1,241 multi-port systems in 2022. Ion placements for the year were 213 versus 192 prior year, and SP placements were 57 for the full year versus 23 systems in the prior year. Globally, placements were strong in the United States and Japan in the year. The use of flexible financing arrangements was substantial in the quarter, particularly in the United States, as customers seek to build capacity, balance their DaVinci system portfolios to improve access, and lastly, to allow flexibility to upgrade to future systems. Jamie will take you through placement dynamics in more detail later in the call. System utilization, defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter, grew 9% globally year-over-year for our multi-port platform, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems. Utilization grew 15% for SP in the year, while it grew 6% for Ion over 2022. Utilization is an important indicator of customer health because it is correlated to patient demand, care team satisfaction, and hospital financial health. The above performance reported revenue of $7.1 billion for the year, 14% growth over ‘22. Our capital and operating expenses were on the upper end of our spend guidance, reflecting continued investments in R&D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints, and capital amortization. Product margins were challenged in the full year as a result of higher than expected costs, primarily for our newer platforms. Jamie will take you through our financial performance in greater detail later in the call. Strength in procedures, growth in the clinical install base, and increased utilization signaled continued belief by our customers that our platforms make a difference in their efforts to pursue the quadruple lane, better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. As we look to 2024, I'd like to share with you that we have submitted to FDA our 510(k) application for our next generation multiport platform, da Vinci 5. Our design priorities for our new platforms are as follows. First, we look for opportunities to bring better minimally invasive care to more patients. Second, we work to improve the performance of our platforms and existing procedures. Third, we seek to improve care team satisfaction through product utility, dependability, and usability improvements. And finally, we strive to help lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. Once cleared, we believe da Vinci 5 will make a positive impact on each of these objectives through hundreds of design changes that respond to surgeon and care team inputs and fulfill our design priorities. As just one example, da Vinci 5 possesses four orders of magnitude greater processing power than our Generation 4 products. That means 10,000 times the processing power to gather data, improve sensing, and deliver better digital and analytic performance. Given the sophistication of the technologies involved, we plan a phased launch in the first several quarters after clearance, giving us time to mature our supply and manufacturing processes for the new system. da Vinci 5 will join our existing robotic surgical system portfolio alongside multiport systems X and Xi and single port system SP, offering surgeons and hospitals their choice of highly capable proven solutions from Intuitive. We have been in communication with FDA on da Vinci 5 for the past several quarters and have completed a comprehensive multi-center IDE trial. This trial finished accruing patients in May of 2023 and we submitted for our 510(k) to FDA for da Vinci 5 in August last year. We are currently responding to FDA's questions. The timing of the US Launch will depend on the time required to resolve these questions. So far, we believe the questions asked fall within normal expectations for a submission of this type. In addition to FDA, we have initiated conversations on da Vinci 5 with regulators in Japan and in Korea and will report our progress toward commercialization in countries outside the United States as we know more. Once FDA cleared, we will communicate features and benefits in greater depth. We started 2023 focused on increased adoption of our priority procedures in countries through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution. We pursued expanded indications and launches for Ion and SP. We focused on excellence in continuity of supply, product quality, and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses. And finally, we pursued increased productivity in our functions that benefit from scale. Taken together, our team made good progress against these objectives. As we enter 2024, our company priorities are as follows. First, we'll focus on innovation through expanded indication and launches of our new platforms by region, including our first phase of da Vinci 5 launch once cleared. Second, we'll pursue increased adoption for focus procedures by country through training commercial activities and market access efforts. Third, we will drive quality and gross margin improvements. And finally, we continue to focus on increasing our productivity, particularly in functions that benefit from industrial scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. And we'll also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2023 revenue, procedures, and system placements are in line with our preliminary press release of January 9th. I will briefly review full year 2023 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail. 2023 procedures grew by 22% as compared to last year, or 17% on a four-year compound annual growth rate basis. As we've discussed on previous calls, 2023 procedure growth was above our longer-term trend primarily because of the need to address patient backlogs. During the year, we placed 1,370 systems with customers, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Excluding trading transactions, net new system placements for 2023 grew by 23% over the prior year, with the US up 26%, driven primarily by customer need for additional capacity. Trading volumes declined by 105 systems to a total of 240 trading transactions for the year. Recurring revenue, which is correlated to ongoing use of our products, represented 83% of total revenue and grew 21% over the prior year. Total revenue of $7.1 billion increased 14% and for the first time our advanced instrument portfolio of stapler and energy devices exceeded $1 billion in revenue, growing 21% in 2023. During the year, we repurchased $416 million of our stock or approximately 1.7 million shares at an average price of $241 per share. We have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $1.1 billion. Given these results, pro forma earnings per share for 2023 grew 22% as compared to last year. Turning to Q4, our core metrics were strong. da Vinci procedures grew 21%. The installed base of systems grew 14% to 8,606 systems, and average system utilization continued to be above long-term trends, increasing by 9% for the full year of 2023. Higher system utilization reflects both a higher mix of shorter duration benign procedures and the need to address patient backlogs. In Q4, US procedures grew 17% driven by growth in general surgery. OUS procedures grew 29%, driven by strong performance in China, the UK, Germany and Japan with notable strength across multiple OUS markets in general surgery which grew 44% in Q4. As a reminder, procedures in China in the fourth quarter of last year were adversely impacted by increasing COVID cases, resulting in negative growth in Q4 of 2022. Turning to capital, we placed 415 systems in the fourth quarter, 12% higher than the 369 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year. In the US, we placed 209 systems in Q4, 28 more than last year, driven by capacity expansion for procedure growth and higher greenfield placements at existing IDN customers. We placed 70 systems in Japan with strengths driven by greenfield placements and customer use of remaining capital budgets. Consistent with last quarter, we have seen delayed tenders and lower system placements in China due to ongoing anti-corruption efforts by the government. We expect system placements in China to be at lower levels at least through the first half of 2024. Globally, there were 51 trading transactions in the quarter as compared to 110 last year. As of the end of Q4, there were approximately 375 SIs remaining in the installed base, 60 of which are in the US. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.93 billion, an increase of 17% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was also 17%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Leasing represented 48% of Q4 placements, compared with 42% last year. The increasing lease mix we have seen over time is primarily driven by customers in the US, particularly those who have acquired systems under usage-based arrangements. These arrangements provide customers greater financial flexibility to expand their robotics programs independent of capital budgets. These arrangements also incorporate technology obsolescence protection for next generation technology. Q4 system average selling prices were $1.42 million as compared to $1.43 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by regional mix, partially offset by lower trade-ins. We recognized $21 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and last year. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800 compared with approximately $1,820 last year. The year-over-year decline in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of procedure mix in the US, given strong growth in cholecystectomy and lower growth in bariatrics and customer ordering patterns, partially offset by the I&A price increase implemented mid-2023. Turning to Ion, there were approximately 16,500 ion procedures in the fourth quarter, an increase of 108% as compared to last year. In Q4, we placed 44 Ion systems compared to 67 in Q4 of 2022 and 55 last quarter. We experienced supply challenges for our Ion catheter and vision probe and limited Ion system placements during the quarter to ensure customers could effectively launch their programs. There is strong customer demand for Ion, which contributed to backlog growth in the quarter. We are working hard and making progress to resolve these supply challenges. The installed base of Ion systems is now 534 systems, of which 214 are under operating lease arrangements. Our SP platform continued to make progress in 2023. Fourth quarter SP procedure growth accelerated to 58%. We placed 19 systems in Q4 and 57 for the year, up from 23 placements in 2022. Fourth quarter placements included five in Korea and two in Japan. Average system utilization for our SP platform grew 15% in 2023, reflecting increased usage by US customers. We continue to make progress in expanding the opportunity for SP, including continued work on regulatory submissions in the US for colorectal and thoracic indications and a system submission in China. In January, we received clearance for SP in Europe across a broad procedure set and are planning for a measured rollout as we build local KOLs and establish local proctoring and training capabilities. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 68% compared with 68.2% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-over-year decline in pro-forma gross margin reflects increased inventory reserves and a higher mix of new platform revenue that currently carry dilutive gross margins, partially offset by the I&A price increase implemented mid last year. With respect to our manufacturing capabilities and capital investment plans, during the quarter we initiated local excise system production in China, allowing us to participate in tenders that require a domestically produced system. We also completed the transfer of X system production to our East Coast hub near Atlanta, Georgia. And during 2024, we are planning to transfer Xi system production from California to our East Coast hub. Over the next 18 months, we expect to open new manufacturing facilities for da Vinci 5 and Ion system manufacturing in California and to complete line transfers for Ion and SP I&A to our Mexicali facility. We believe these activities will position Intuitive to serve our customers with best-in-class supply availability, product quality and product cost. Fourth quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 15% compared with last year, driven by increased headcount and higher variable compensation. In addition, fourth quarter 2023 operating expenses included a $40 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation. We did not make a contribution in 2022. Pro forma other income was $67.1 million for Q4, higher than $57.9 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15.9%, lower than prior quarters, primarily because of the release of certain tax reserves associated with the expiration of related statutes and a favorable earnings mix. Fourth quarter 2023 pro forma net income was $574 million or $1.60 per share compared with $439 million or $1.23 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $606 million or $1.69 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with gap net income of $325 million or $0.91 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter GAAP tax expense reflected one-time benefits of $159 million associated with an increase in deferred tax assets associated with a statutory rate increase in Switzerland and receipt of certain tax benefits associated with our Swiss operations. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. We ended the year with cash investments of $7.3 billion compared with $7.5 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected capital expenditures of $435 million, partially offset by cash generated from operating activities. Let me take a moment to address the new multiple system that Gary highlighted and certain assumptions that may impact 2024 modeling. First, since we have not received FDA clearance for da Vinci 5, we cannot provide specificity on launch timing and pricing. Second, once cleared, we are planning a phased launch period over several quarters. Noting that we are at the end of the Si trading cycle and that da Vinci 5 will be in a phased rollout, we expect total trading volumes to be lower in 2024 than the prior year. Given that, and our procedure guidance of 13% to 16% growth, we also expect total system placements for 2024 to be lower than 2023. As a result of the phased rollout of da Vinci 5, we expect a higher proportion of Gen 4 systems will be leased as customers seek flexibility to upgrade to da Vinci 5 when supply allows. For those customers that prefer to purchase a Gen 4 system, we will offer a future trading right that can be exercised when there is sufficient da Vinci 5 supply. Purchase contracts containing a trading right result in a deferral of a portion of the purchase price negatively impacting systems revenue. Finally, consistent with our experience bringing four generations of platforms to market, new systems typically start at lower gross margins and rise over a multiyear period as we build volume and optimize design, manufacturing and supply chains. Brian will describe our gross margin guidance in more detail later in the call. Before I turn it over to Brian to discuss clinical highlights and our outlook for 2024, let me address operating margins. 2023 pro forma operating margin was 34% of revenue compared to 35% in the prior year. We expect operating margins to be under pressure in 2024, given the anticipated launch of da Vinci 5, increased depreciation expense and an adverse mix impact to gross margin from the growth in new platforms. However, as we look to the medium term, we see opportunity for operating margin expansion based on the following dynamics. One, moving to broad launching da Vinci 5, allowing customers the opportunity to upgrade their existing fleet to the latest technology. Two, improving gross margin. We aspire to be above the 70% level over time. And three, leveraging those functions that can take advantage of scale as we grow. Improvements to gross margin will be driven by the following actions: First, improving the product cost of new platforms, including da Vinci 5. Second, growing into and eventually leveraging the incremental fixed costs from new manufacturing facilities. And third, the return of resources that have been deployed to supply continuity given the impact of the pandemic to returning to routine manufacturing and product cost reduction activities. We have the teams and capability to deliver on these efforts over the next several years. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian.
Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Overall procedure growth for full year 2023 was 22% year-over-year compared to 18% for the full year of 2022. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 19% growth in the US and 27% growth outside of the US. In the US, fourth quarter 2023 procedure growth was 17% year-over-year compared to 18% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 17% last quarter. Fourth quarter growth was led by procedures within general surgery, with strength in cholecystectomy, colon resection and foregut procedures. As Gary noted, bariatric procedures continued to grow year-over-year, but growth moderated into the mid-single digits. Looking outside of the US, over the years, we have made investments in countries and international markets to support customers and their adoption of da Vinci procedures. Looking back over the past decade, OUS procedures have grown 20% on a compound annual growth basis and have consistently been accretive to total procedure growth. OUS procedures have grown from about 20% of total global procedures to now about a third. While market maturity and levels of adoption differ by region and country, broadly, we now see more than half of OUS growth being led by procedures beyond urology, reflecting customers' growing adoption of general surgery, gynecology and thoracic procedures, the results of which I will highlight below. Focusing on the fourth quarter, OUS procedure volume grew 29% compared with 18% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 24% last quarter. Growth was led by strength in colon resection followed by growth in hysterectomy and lung resection procedures. Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. In Europe, fourth quarter growth was led by general surgery and gynecology procedure categories. Germany, the UK and France procedure performance led the region. In Germany, we saw strong growth in colon resection and kidney procedures, in the UK from growth in hysterectomy and rectal resection and in France from growth in colorectal and lung resection procedures. In Asia, growth in the fourth quarter was led by China, reflecting a benefit from lower procedure volumes in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to COVID. In Japan, our third largest market by procedure volume, procedure growth was healthy and led by prostatectomy and colorectal procedures. We placed 70 systems in Japan, reflecting the continued adoption of robotic surgery for a growing number of procedures and the availability of remaining capital budgets. India, while still in the early stage of adoption, saw continued strength in general surgery and gynecology procedures. Now, turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. In the fourth quarter, Dr. Nicola de'Angelis from Beaujon University Hospital, along with multiple colleagues from the French Society of Parietal Surgery, Club Hernie, and French Society of Digestive and Visceral Surgery, published a systematic review and meta-analysis describing robotic surgery for inguinal and ventral hernias in surgical endoscopy. In this analysis, authors reviewed publications between September 2014 and July 2022 and published pooled outcomes comparing the robotic-assisted approach for both inguinal and ventral hernia repairs to both laparoscopy and the open approach. With regards to inguinal hernia, when compared to laparoscopy, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 46% lower risk of hernia recurrence. Furthermore, subjects undergoing a robotic-assisted approach were associated with a 54% lower rate of opioid use relative to the open approach. For ventral hernia repairs, the robotic-assisted approach had a 49% lower risk of conversion to open and 41% lower risk of intraoperative bowel injuries relative to laparoscopy. When comparing to an open repair for ventral hernias, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 3.4-day shorter length of stay, 34% lower risk of 30-day readmissions, 39% lower risk of overall complications, and more specifically, a 53% lower risk of surgical site infections. The authors concluded, “the present systematic review and meta-analysis supports the use of robotic surgery for abdominal wall hernia repair. Pooled data analysis show improved outcomes over laparoscopy and open surgery, particularly for ventral hernia repair. Overall, these results based on 64 studies support robotic surgery as a safe, effective and viable alternative to traditional open and laparoscopic surgery for inguinal and ventral hernia repair. And may contribute to dismiss the residual skepticism and increase the interest towards this minimally invasive surgical technique". I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement earlier this month, total 2023 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 22% year-over-year to over 2,280,000 procedures performed worldwide. For 2024, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 13% and 16%. Our overall procedure guidance range assumes that growth moderates from last year, given the elevated backlog benefit we experienced in 2023. The low end of the range assumes a modest decline in bariatric procedures along with challenges in China from increasing competition and anticorruption activities impacting capital placements, and therefore, procedure growth. We also assume there is no impact from patient backlog in the year. At the high end of the range, we assume bariatrics continues at current growth rates, and factors in China do not have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we assume any backlog of patients would decline throughout the year. Finally, we would expect that procedure seasonality will follow normalized historical patterns, resulting in a tough comparison for the first half of 2024, given the strong procedure growth in the first half of last year. Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2023 pro forma gross profit margin was 68%. In 2024, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 67% and 68% of net revenue. The lower estimate of pro forma gross profit margin in 2024 reflects the impact of growth in our newer products, and the impact of capital investments that will come on to support the growth of our business. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trading mix, impact of new product introductions and pricing. Turning to operating expenses. In 2023, our pro forma operating expenses grew 14%. In 2024, we expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. The operating expense growth reflects increased depreciation expense as we bring on new facilities and investments to drive our growth objectives. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $680 million to $710 million in 2024. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $290 million and $320 million in 2024. With regard to capital expenditures, we expect the range to total between $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, in 2023, our pro forma income tax rate was 20.6%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2024 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Sir, your line is open now.
Larry Biegelsen: Can you hear me?
Gary Guthart: Yeah, Larry.
Larry Biegelsen: You can hear me. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a nice end to the year here. Thanks for all the color on da Vinci 5. So obviously, a few questions on that. I'd love to start with just, Jamie, maybe a framework for how to think about the financial implications of a new system beyond 2024. Is the Xi launch a good analog from a pacing standpoint? And what are the ramifications of leasing? If a customer on the lease upgrade, will the lease get the ASP lift? We assume you'll have. And what will you do with returned Xi? And I had just one follow-up.
Jamie Samath: Yeah. I would say the dynamics are quite different between when we launched Xi in 2014 versus where we are today. And I think the feature sets of da Vinci 5, which we haven't described I think an important context for you all, which we'll do once we have clearance. You look at relative penetration of da Vinci over that period, the extent to which leasing has changed significantly our OUS penetration. I think there are a number of factors, Larry, where I would not use the kind of Xi ramp and progression as a reference point for how da Vinci 5 might progress. But I think that I would make any further comments on that once we get through clearance and are able to talk to you about the feature set.
Larry Biegelsen: Any color…
Jamie Samath: With respect to the lease. So I think there are a number of dynamics that in the end will motivate a customer to look at a trade even if they have an existing system under lease. If I hold everything else equal and just look at the fact that the asset is leased, I do think there is some benefit to the customer insofar as they can avoid a capital budget barrier to executing an upgrade. But I think you have to look at all of the other dynamics that we're yet to describe.
Larry Biegelsen: Okay. And then I guess on the new system, I'll try my luck here. Just lastly, do you expect the same indications on as Xi upon launch? And, Gary, is this more about improving outcomes in existing procedures or expanding addressable procedures? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yeah, we submitted for broad indications and in the IDE trial it was a broad indication trial. What that looks like in the end, we'll come down to how we answer some of the questions that come back and forth. So I'm not telling you what the end point is, but I can tell you what our starting point is. In terms of kind of breadth and depth, we think that it will allow for additional penetration into some of the categories we're in already. And maybe an analogy is you could do some general surgery with Si, the earlier system, we had clearances there, but Xi had some product improvements and some really nice forward progress that allowed us for greater penetration depth. So there's opportunity for depth. We think over time there's opportunity for additional indications. Those are unlikely to occur right out of the gate. And we think that there's some really nice indications to talk about or features to talk about in future calls.
Larry Biegelsen: Thank you.
Operator: Okay, we'll go to the next line. We go to Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Travis Steed: Hey, everybody. Can you hear me okay?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Hi, Travis.
Travis Steed: All right, great. Maybe just high level, just like -- you were talking about da Vinci 5 having hundreds of design changes. When you just think about da Vinci 5 and kind of driving the quad aim, maybe just kind of talk about high level, more what you're trying to solve for with some of those design changes. What's different about da Vinci 5 versus da Vinci 4? And is it possible we could see a system in 2024? Is it more likely in 2025?
Gary Guthart: I laid out in the script kind of what our design methodology was. I am dying to tell you more about da Vinci 5, but I'll wait for clearance and for the final back and forth with FDA so we can do that with a little more care. So that's kind of where we are on that set. We're excited about it. I think it is substantive and I think some of the improvements that we can bring are going to be interesting and exciting. We are submitted and we're in the back and forth with FDA. It is our hope that it is a ‘24 launch. They ultimately are the arbiters of when we get clearance. But what I'd say based on past experience with them is that we're in a constructive conversation that we understand. And if that goes the way we want, then certainly it's something we'd be excited about in ‘24. But I can't guarantee it because I don't have the clearance yet.
Travis Steed: That's helpful. Would you expect some sort of ASP uplift versus da Vinci 4 and maybe also talk about the manufacturing capacity? How long will it take to get to scale on the manufacturing and how would that look kind of versus the Xi launch? Can you do hundreds a year or thousands a year? I'm just kind of curious where, if that's a limiting factor in kind of the availability of these systems going forward. Thanks a lot.
Gary Guthart: Yeah, I'll start with just a little bit of color on ASP and then I'll turn it over to Jamie. We won't call any ASP right now. We want to both get through the final clearances. What I will say is there are some differences relative to X, Xi that make that discussion a little detailed. And it's important for it to be detailed and clear for the customer to understand what they're going to be buying. So we're going to pause that for now. With regard to manufacturing ramp, clearly we're going to be in a phased launch. I think we'll be supply constrained in the early side of that, kind of intentionally as we work through manufacturing process, but in terms of pacing and what that might feel like, Jamie, let me turn it over to you.
Jamie Samath: To some extent, it will obviously depend how that progresses both within our four walls and with our suppliers. Certainly, it’s several quarters. I would take several quarters to be something that's beyond a year, but I think you have to watch us make progress here, and we'll keep you updated.
Travis Steed: All right, great. Thanks a lot and congrats.
Gary Guthart: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to the line of Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Robbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter. I'm going to push my luck again. Gary, one of the things we talked about two weeks ago on stage was big data and the potential to integrate it into your systems. Maybe if we think about just philosophically da Vinci 5, is this something we'll see a lot more software improvements rather than hardware improvements? I realize you're not giving specific details, but is software and the ability to add future software updates something we can be looking forward to?
Gary Guthart: Yeah, one of the things we talked about in the script is the increase in computational capability of the system, the re-baselining of that system. And one of the reasons for that is future programmability. Some of the things that we'll be able to bring out of the gate are pretty exciting, but it also gives us the opportunity to build on that base and sequential software releases. So it's a good pull-through, Robbie. The point you make is a good one, and we do want to pull through software capability. It will not just be software that we bring to market, but it's a starting point. Just to remind everybody back in the Xi launch period, Xi didn't have everything that we could possibly do with it at first year of launch either. It's something that as we build capability and build skill we can add to over time, and we've done that for years, we will do the same in dV 5, it is a platform upon which we can build for many years to come.
Robbie Marcus: Great. And maybe one for Jamie. OpEx stepping up with the new product launch, you talked about in the midterm, seeing operating margin expansion, we're also seeing elevated CapEx this year as you talked about all the manufacturing plants. Maybe addressing them both, how should we think about where all of these expenses are going, particularly in OpEx this year, R&D versus SG&A? And what types of activities in each? And then is three years a good time frame to think about for the midterm when we might see these spending trends moderate? Thanks a lot.
Jamie Samath: Yeah. Let me take CapEx first. In '23 and '24, the majority of those capital investments are for manufacturing facilities and to add manufacturing capacity in particular to our Mexicali factory. So a significant portion of the depreciation that comes with that will show up in cost of sales, and that's reflected in part in the '24 gross margin guidance. Some of it will show up in OpEx, and that will therefore be reflected in SG&A. If I look at the relative growth in R&D and SG&A in '24, I think it's relatively similar. Obviously, innovation in R&D is important to us. But you will have a little bit of an impact in '24 at least for incremental depreciation. We still see opportunity to leverage some of our enabling functions. There are some other functions that also can leverage as we scale and grow, and so we'll look to do that over the next couple of years. With respect to the kind of operating margin expansion opportunity that I described in my prepared remarks. And we said over the medium term, I'd kind of broadly say that's a three- to five-year horizon. We have a specific set of actions and plans that we need to execute. Those teams have those as goals. There's some variability, obviously, in terms of how they get executed and there's some interrelationship between set of actions that need to be completed. So there are dynamics there that can impact the speed at which that gets executed. And of course, we have to run our business in the meantime.
Robbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for the thoughts.
Operator: And we'll go over to the line of Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Good evening everybody, and great to see the Gen 5 announcement. Maybe I'm going to go into a slightly different direction. Maybe we can get some updates and more details, more color on Ion and SP. SP, Gary, the strongest quarter ever. I'm just curious your thoughts about '24 and the next couple of years. What's next? How are you -- what are the team priorities for '24? And on the Ion side, maybe more for Jamie, you gave us some good color about demand strong and supply constraints continue. How are you thinking and what are you dialing into your thinking for '24 about resolution of the catheter and the vision probe limitations? When are you hoping that, that gets largely better result?
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Rick. On the SP front, we're pleased with the step forward they took in '23. It was good. We're seeing more focused efforts in our commercial team in the US, which has been good. We're excited about its entry into Japan, and we're starting to see a build of activity in Japan, too. So that's been good. We expect to see it in Europe in '24, and that's another nice step. And I think that's a broader set of clinical indications as it was in Korea and Japan. So it gives us a little more freedom to operate, which is great. In the US, we have trials that had finished accrual and have been submitted or will be submitted soon in thoracic and colorectal that will give our US customers more opportunity to use SP in a multiplatform -- multispecialty environment. So I think SP continues to be a nice build. So that looks good. And team has their marching orders and is working down that set of processes. We have a breast oncology trial that's ongoing that we're excited about also that will not make a big impact in '24, but starts to open additional opportunity for narrow access surgery thereafter. So that's kind of where we are in SP, so far, so good. I'll turn it over to Jamie and talk about Ion.
Jamie Samath: Not ready to be particularly specific yet on when the supply chain challenges are behind us. For catheter, you have three dynamics. So we had a specific supply constraint that impacted us. We are, at the same time, transferring a number of catheter lines to Mexicali. And we're doing that as the business is effectively doubling, so you're bringing on new staff, you're having to train them. So that's a real effort that takes some time. And I think there's a little bit of variability in terms of when we get to point where that's behind us. So I'm going to let us have another quarter before we talk about when that's resolved. The teams are making clear progress, but there's work still will be done. On the vision probe, I think it's a relatively simpler problem for us to address. There isn't a supplier dependency within that particular area. It's really just us being able to execute, again, a line transfer as the business is doubling and the team are making great progress. But stay tuned.
Rick Wise: Got you. And just one follow-up on Gen 5 and what's next. You said, Jamie, and it makes sense that probably in the next couple of quarters or until you launch, customers probably will lean more toward the leases with an upgrade clause. If I understood you. But I was just reflecting on it, should we imagine that, that could accelerate this sort of leasing approach in the near term for Xi, and as people, I guess, preferentially, potentially possibly maybe line up to get Gen 5 and that puts them in a more favorable position. How does that all -- how are all those dynamics work? Is this good? Better for sales that this transition occurs? Or is it going to be more complicated?
Jamie Samath: Well, I think the first effect is we'll see the operating lease proportion of placements increased from where it's been. And again, that's because customers are motivated to have the protection that's in those clauses so that they can upgrade da Vinci 5 when it becomes more broadly available. So that was the first kind of message we wanted to provide in terms of 2024 modeling. In terms of then how that gets upgraded, it's really a function of when does da Vinci 5 launch, which obviously we can't be specific about right now, and there's some things to work through with FDA. And then what's the period of time over which we then go from a constrained or phased launch to a full launch. And so I don't see that particularly as somehow a revenue benefit in '24. I think what we're saying is you'll have more of the placements that are leased, and therefore, that revenue is spread over time.
Gary Guthart: More likely to be a slight negative than a slight positive. And I think the things we've put in place for customer transparency, the ability to see it, work to mitigate the feeling of having to wait and they'll get a chance to put their hands on it and see it. But I don't see it as an accelerant.
Rick Wise: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Adam Maeder: Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a great year. I wanted to start on China and ask about the quota that went effective last summer as well as the anticorruption campaign. If I heard the commentary correct -- correctly, it sounds like you expect systems to be impacted -- system placements to be impacted through the first half of 2024. Does that mean there's some optimism that placements could get better in the back half of the year? And just any additional color on what you're seeing in that geography regarding anticorruption campaign would be very appreciated. Thank you.
Jamie Samath: Indications so far have been that, that anticorruption effort is a year-long effort which would take us to the middle of '24. And so that's why we indicated that we would expect delayed tenders through the period in which that effort is ongoing. We don't have great visibility, frankly, beyond the first half of '24. And that's why in the prepared remarks, we said at least through the first half of '24. So yes, if that effort was to be resolved, and if things start to normalize in terms of the pace at which tenders occurred, then you could see some opportunity for that to recover. But we're not in a position where we can predict that at this point.
Adam Maeder: That's helpful color, Jamie. Thanks for that. And for the follow-up, I wanted to ask about the procedure growth guidance, the 13% to 16% for this year. Maybe you could flesh that out for a little bit, a little bit by geography, US versus international. How you're thinking about that as well as, I guess, Europe versus Asia specifically. And just any color on quarterly cadence would be appreciated as well. Thanks again.
Jamie Samath: Let me start with seasonality. And I'm not going to be specific on quarterly cadence, but I do think I tried to emphasize in our prepared remarks that we believe that the first half will be a tougher comp versus last year. And so using that, the comparison from last year and then also thinking about our historical sort of cadence throughout the year, I think you can look at that history and just make an assumption on what that growth rate -- what those growth rates could be by quarter. Let's talk about factors in the procedure guidance. So those -- there's really three primary factors, right? You have -- we've called out bariatric growth rates, and that's primarily a US factor. We talked a bit about from an OUS perspective, China, and then also backlog in the system. And so the backlog also being primarily a US factor. But could still be broader. But -- so I'm not going to go into specifics as far as US versus OUS. But I think I'd go back and just really center you on our comments around bariatric growth rates, right? Low end of the range assumes that there's some continued moderation in bariatric procedures and at the high end of the range that it assumes current growth rates. There's some impact in China at the low end of the range just from the discussion that we had right now an anticorruption and how long that actually persists and then the benefit of backlog and how that will persist throughout the year.
Gary Guthart: In soft tissue surgery, I would just say, if you look at '23, the two primary growth drivers that we've called out is general surgery in the US, that grew 25% in 2023. And for OUS, beyond urology that grew 35% in '23. And at the core, we think those continue to be growth drivers for the business.
Adam Maeder: Thanks very much.
Operator: And we'll go to the next line. Go to the line of Drew Ranieri of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Drew Ranieri: Gary, just, maybe just broadly on da Vinci 5 and just the TAM that you kind of updated at the conference earlier this month. How are you -- could you maybe just update us maybe on how you're thinking about penetration today in general surgery, where you are with chole, hernia, colorectal bariatrics, just to help us level set because it sounds like this could be another progression in general surgery for the company? And then I had a follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Sure. Jamie, I'll let you take the kind of characterization of where we are in the adoption curves of general surgery, hernia, benign, chole and so on.
Jamie Samath: If you take a look at the US, and I'm going to put this in quartiles for a second in terms of where we are in the adoption curve, colorectal we're in the second quartile. Bariatrics, also the second quartile. Actually cholecystectomy and hernia all in the second quartile in terms of where they are along the adoption curve. And so that obviously gives us some continuing runway to grow, and that's a driver behind the US general surgery growth rates that we've seen. In the international markets, by the way, just in terms of general surgery, for the most part -- in most of the larger markets, we're in the first quarter of adoption. It's early. What we're seeing is growth start to stick and those don't start to be on early growth rates. Particularly in the cancer procedures, colorectal and beyond general surgery in hysterectomy and thoracic.
Gary Guthart: With regard to dV 5, I won't call out what specific targeting has been. We'll talk about more about dV 5 when we get a chance to talk about clearance. We do think that it's something that can help improve outcomes in multiple places. And we look forward to talking to you about that when we have the opportunity. If you have one follow-up, Drew, I'll take the follow-up. Otherwise, we'll close the call. So Drew, you have one more?
Drew Ranieri: Sure. Yeah. Just on da Vinci 5. Can you maybe just talk about how it might be able to improve access to hospitals? I know that you have many IDNs that have added more systems, but do you see that more as an opportunity? Or do you see just maybe better access for even smaller hospitals with having multiport systems in the portfolio? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Thank you for the question. We think that having a portfolio of choices makes a ton of sense for hospitals. And this will be a part of that portfolio. We talked about it in the prepared script. Got to give people choice. Some of that choice will have to do with how they view their practice. Some of it may have to do with what their site of care looks like and feels like. So that gives us some optionality and gives our customers optionality. I think that's really healthy. So thank you, Drew. Appreciate the question.
Gary Guthart: That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and caregivers in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim. Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost to treat. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and in their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Thank you, everyone, for joining today's conference call. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-19 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you, everyone, for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q3 2023 Earnings Release. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Intuitive Surgical, Brian King. Please go ahead.
Brian King: Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; Jamie Samath, our CFO; and Dr. Myriam Curet, our Chief Medical Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2023, and Form 10-Q filed on July 24, 2023. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, Myriam will present clinical highlights, and I will discuss procedure details and provide our updated financial outlook for 2023. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. In this third quarter, we saw a strong growth in procedures performed by our customers, solid new system placements and healthy growth in utilization amid market conditions that remain largely consistent with Q2. Our new platforms continue to gain ground with Ion installs and procedure growth continuing, SP installs and procedure growth modestly accelerating and healthy growth in customer use of our digital tools. Turning first to procedures. da Vinci procedure growth in the quarter was 19%. Areas of strength included general surgery for benign conditions, particularly in the United States and broad regional growth with Germany, Japan, the U.K. and India standouts. China procedure growth was in line with our global average in the quarter. U.S. dermal surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and colon resection. Ion procedures showed continued strength with 125% growth in the quarter. SP procedure growth accelerated with 54% global growth in the quarter driven by strength in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 312 systems in Q3 compared with 305 systems in Q3 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands 8,127 multiport da Vinci systems, 490 Ion systems and 158 single-port da Vinci systems. Overall, our capital placement trends reflect demand for additional capacity in multiport, continued greenfield interest in our Ion system and a modest acceleration for placements of SP. The proportion of leases for new capital placements accelerated in the quarter with the U.S. using the highest leasing rates. We think the acceleration in leasing reflects the convenience of our leasing program and the maturity of our Generation 4 multiport systems. While leasing reduces in-quarter revenue relative to capital purchase, total economics are healthy for our customer and for us. Leasing allows our customers to build clinical capacity when and where they need it and provides predefined pathways for our new technology as it enters the market. The growth rate in system utilization, defined as procedures per installed system per quarter was 6%, down from 9% last quarter while still above historical growth rates. Strong procedure growth and increased proportion of use in benign indications shortens average procedure times and needs of scheduling. Higher utilization increases our customers' return on invested capital and is economically healthy for us. Turning to our finances. Our revenue grew 12% in the quarter and our operating expenses were within our spend guidance. Our spending reflects continued investments in research and development to support the growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints and capital amortization. Looking at the broader picture, our fourth-generation da Vinci platform is operating at global scale and embedded in a robust ecosystem of instruments, accessories, training and services. Customer acceptance of our Ion platform is strong. Acceptance of our da Vinci SP is accelerating with new indications in the pipeline, and our digital tools are building momentum through their early stages. We welcome Dr. Myriam Curet, Intuitive's Chief Medical Officer to this call, and she will take us through our clinical perspective and some of the work we're doing to expand indications. Our operations teams did a fantastic job supporting our customers through the supply chain shocks of the past several years. This unavoidable effort diverted resources away from product cost reduction and as supply chain stresses ease, we're now pivoting our attention to once again lowering our product costs. Areas of opportunity include our Ion program, our SP accessories portfolio and our multiport accessories in advanced instrument lines. Given the timing of facilities completion, manufacturing efficiency improvements for new products and other complex projects, we expect variability in gross margin over the coming quarters as we work through these programs. Turning to our digital offerings, customer use of our digital tools and channels is growing nicely. Our SimNow surgical simulators are installed at the majority of our customer sites and subscription renewal rates are outstanding. Routine use of My Intuitive app by over 10,000 da Vinci surgeons grew by 140% year-over-year and is receiving strong Net Promoter Scores that continue improving over time. Our Intuitive Hub media management and telepresence system installations grew 58% in the quarter, and Hub captured surgical cases grew 61%. In closing, core demand is healthy. We're focused on in our ecosystem internationally and driving our product cost down, particularly for our newer platforms. We are dogged in pursuit of significant long-term opportunity to improve the quadruple aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics, and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Core metrics continue to be healthy in Q3, with global procedure growth of 19% and an increase in the installed base of da Vinci systems of 13% and an increase in average system utilization of 6%. Our key financial indicators were also healthy. Third quarter recurring revenue grew 21%. Pro forma operating margin was 36%, and pro forma earnings per share increased 23% over last year. Procedures in the U.S. grew 17%, reflecting a lower benefit from patient backlogs as compared to the first half of 2023. Last quarter, we highlighted that our growth rate in bariatric's procedures in the U.S. had slowed given patient interest in weight loss drugs. In Q3, we continued to see double-digit growth albeit at a modestly lower growth rate as compared to Q2. Bariatric's procedures represent between 4% and 5% of total global procedures. Based on third-party data, we believe we continue to gain market share in the bariatric surgical segment. OUS procedures grew 24% with relative strength in India, Germany, the U.K. and Japan. Procedure growth in China was consistent with our expectations, lower than last quarter due to a strong base period given the recovery from COVID-related lockdowns in the year ago quarter. Consistent with recent trends, growth in non-neurology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 31%. Within the larger cancer categories, our fastest-growing OUS procedure is colon resection, a high-value procedure led by adoption in Japan, Germany and the U.K. With respect to capital performance, we placed 312 systems in the third quarter as compared to 305 systems last year. As a reminder, system placements in Q3 of last year benefit from a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered in June of last year. Late in Q3, we started to see delays in tender processes in China, primarily as a result of anticorruption efforts by the central government, resulting in lower system placements in China in Q3. We expect tender delays to continue to impact system placements in China in Q4. Q3 revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Q3 revenue growth was driven by procedure growth, partially offset by an 11% decline in systems revenue due to the significant increase in the mix of operating lease arrangements. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue growth was also 12%. Given recent movements in exchange rates, at current rates, the U.S. dollar is approximately 3% stronger on a revenue-weighted basis as compared to the average rates realized in Q3. Revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represent approximately 24% of total revenue. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we placed 159 systems in the third quarter compared to 175 systems placed last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 153 systems in Q3 compared with 130 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 60 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 10 into China compared with 54 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 15 into China in Q3 of last year. 62 of the 312 systems placed in Q3 were trading transactions compared to 71 trading transactions in the third quarter of last year. As of the end of Q3, there are approximately 440 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 85 are in the U.S. Operating leases represented 52% of third quarter placements compared with 37% last year. In the U.S., 70% of system placements in Q3 were under operating lease arrangements compared to 48% last year. Of the 163 operating lease placements in the quarter, 93 were usage-based arrangements, an increase compared to 54% last year, reflecting customer preferences, particularly in the U.S. While leasing may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Q3 system average selling prices were $1.4 million as compared to $1.39 million last quarter from $1.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease in system ASPs was primarily driven by lower pricing and geographical mix. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared with $12 million last quarter and $17 million in Q3 of 2022. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure of approximately $1,830, compared with approximately $1,840 last quarter and $1,800 last year. On a sequential basis, lower I&A per procedure reflected the impact of customer ordering patterns, partially offset by a full quarter impact from the I&A price increase that went into effect halfway through last quarter. Turning to our Ion platform. In Q3, we placed 55 Ion systems as compared to 50 in Q3 of 2022. Third quarter Ion procedures of approximately 14,500 increased 125% as compared to last year. 16 of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems, 12 into the U.S. and four into Korea. SP procedures grew by 54%, and average system utilization growth continued to accelerate growing 21% compared to Q3 of last year. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter was 68.8% compared with 68.5% last quarter and 69.8% last year. As a reminder, pro forma gross margin in Q3 of last year included a onetime benefit of approximately 50 basis points related to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. The remaining year-over-year difference in pro forma gross margin is primarily due to a higher mix of the Ion revenue, which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business and lower system ASP, partially offset by the I&A price increase. Inventory increased to approximately 180 days in Q3, higher than historical averages, driven by two factors: first, we have modestly increased our inventory targets given supply chain stresses over the last couple of years; and secondly, given significant capital investments we are making in manufacturing facilities and capacity, we are building bridge inventory to facilitate an elevated number of line transfers to new locations. As a result, we expect higher levels of inventory relative to historical norms into 2025. Third quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount-related costs. During the quarter, our head count increased by 489 employees, of which approximately 275 were for our manufacturing operations in support of revenue growth. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were lower by 100 basis points as compared to Q3 of last year and largely reflected planned leverage in our enabling functions. Pro forma other income in Q3 was $58 million compared to $42 million last quarter and $7 million last year. Other income primarily consists of interest income and the increase as compared to last quarter was driven by higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances. Pro forma other income in Q3 of last year also reflected higher than typical foreign exchange losses resulting from remeasurement of the balance sheet as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $256 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations. Third quarter pro forma net income was $524 million or $1.46 per share compared with $429 million or $1.19 per share for Q3 of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $416 million or $1.16 per share for the third quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $324 million or $0.90 per share for the third quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.5 billion compared with $7.1 billion last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities and proceeds from employee stock exercises partially offset by capital expenditures. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Myriam, who will discuss clinical highlights.
Myriam Curet: Thank you. Now turning to the clinical side for our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. In addition to relaying the results of one of these studies, I'd like to start by describing the status of some important Intuitive research projects underway that support our company's belief in the potential value of da Vinci systems specifically our single-port system for procedures requiring refined access to tight or difficult to reach anatomical areas. In June 2021, Intuitive launched an FDA-approved clinical study focused on complex colorectal procedures, such as low anterior resection or right colectomy, performed using the SP platform. Currently, enrollment is complete with 60 patients across nine sites in the U.S. and Korea. Another FDA-approved trials for rapid procedures in pulmonary lobectomy and thymectomy performed using SP completed enrollment in June of this year with 32 subjects enrolled across six centers in the U.S. We believe that Intuitive single-port technology will enable thoracic surgeons to perform uniportal lobectomy, something that may be difficult using a VATS approach. Intuitive intent to submit data from these two studies to the FDA after the patient follow-up outlined in the study plan and the data analysis has been completed. Now I'll turn to a notable study published in the Annals of Surgery this past August. This study was not sponsored by Intuitive. Dr. Yogita Patel of McMaster University in Canada published early results from the RAVAL trial in a manuscript titled Robotic Lobectomy is cost effective and provides comparable health utility scores to video-assisted lobectomy. This study describes results from a multicenter, multinational, blinded, randomized controlled study comparing the da Vinci and VATS approach to pulmonary lobectomy. It analyzed 164 subjects, 81 in new robotic-assisted group and 82 in the VATS group. And all robotic-assisted lobectomies were performed with a da Vinci multiport platform. Notably, the health utility score was significantly higher in the da Vinci arm at seven weeks and 12 weeks post procedure, which suggests the quality of life for patients who underwent a da Vinci lobectomy was better than for patients undergoing the VATS procedure. Interestingly, and related to quality of life outcomes, the authors analyzed the incremental cost-effective ratio or ICER for the robotic group relative to VATS and reported the robotic group was associated with a gain of approximately $11,000 per quality adjusted life year. In addition, the median number of lymph nodes examined and sampled were significantly higher in the da Vinci Group. To summarize, the authors conclude that, early results from the RAVAL trials suggest that robotic pulmonary lobectomy is a cost-effective intervention, which is associated with comparable patient-reported health utility scores when compared to VATS lobectomy. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian who will discuss additional procedure highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2024.
Brian King: Thank you, Myriam. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was 19% year-over-year compared to 20% for the third quarter of 2022 and 22% last quarter. In the U.S., third quarter 2023 procedure growth was 17% year-over-year compared to 18% for the third quarter of 2022 and 19% last quarter. Q3 growth was led by procedure strength within general surgery, with particular strength in cholecystectomy and colon resection. Outside of the U.S., third quarter procedure volume grew 24% compared with 24% for the third quarter of 2022 and 28% last quarter. OUS growth was led by procedures beyond urology, which now make up approximately 50% of total OUS procedures. General surgery growth was strong, primarily in colorectal procedures followed by growth in gynecology procedures. Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in Germany, the U.K. and Spain. In each of the regions noted, procedure growth was led by general surgery, primarily from colorectal procedures and specifically in Germany and the U.K., hysterectomy procedures also contributed to strong growth. In Asia, growth was led by Japan. More than half of the incremental procedure growth in the country was led by strong growth in general surgery procedures, consisting largely of colorectal and gastrectomy procedures. In China, procedure growth was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Growth was driven primarily in neurology, notably by prostatectomy and kidney procedures. In India, while in the early stage of adoption, saw strong growth in general surgery procedures, namely cholecystectomy and hernia repair and growth in gynecology procedures. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 20% to 22%. We are now raising the low end from 20% to 21% and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 21% to 22%. The low end of the range reflects uncertainty around the duration of elevated procedure volumes with patients returning to health care, a continued slowing of bariatric growth rates in the U.S. and macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending. At the high end of the range, we assume macroeconomic challenges do not have a significant impact on hospital procedure volumes, and bariatric growth rates in the U.S. continue at the rate we experienced in Q3. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. We are now refining our estimate of pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 68.5%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 15%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 14%. We are also refining our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between $600 million to $610 million in 2023, lowering the range from our previous estimates of $600 million to $620 million. We are increasing our estimate for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $190 million and $200 million in 2023, an increase from our previous estimate of $160 million and $180 million. The increase primarily reflects the rise in interest rates. With regard to capital expenditures, we are narrowing our estimate to range between $900 million to $1 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, we are also refining our estimate for the 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 23% of pretax income, reducing the previous estimate of the upper end of the range from 24% to 23%. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We go to the first question from the line of Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Robert Marcus: Great. Congrats on good quarter. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to start, it's hard to escape it. GLP-1 is becoming a very big topic in med tech. And your -- it's impacting bariatric surgery here. It doesn't seem to be impacting anything else, particularly in the pipeline. But just wondering your thoughts overall, could GLP-1s ultimately be a positive as more people try weight loss surgery and come in the funnel? And any other impacts good or bad that you foresee on business?
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Robbie. I'm going to ask Dr. Curet as a bariatric surgeon to go ahead and weigh in on that first part of your question, and we'll talk about the broader implications after that.
Myriam Curet: I think you are correct. I think in the short term, we will see patients who are considering or are in the pipeline for bariatric surgery going to try the drug. However, given compliance issues, costs, side effects, we expect that many of them will not stay on the drug for longer than a year or 2. And at that time, we'll consider bariatric surgery. So I think overall, we'll see an increased interest in bariatric surgery, but that will get delayed in the short term.
Gary Guthart: Robbie, any follow-up you wanted on GLP-1s?
Robert Marcus: No, I had a financial question for Jamie, if that's okay, after.
Gary Guthart: Please.
Robert Marcus: Jamie, it looks like the fourth quarter gross margin is ticking down a bit, and you're talking about the increased depreciation cost and some of these new investments here. I was wondering if you could seize the amount, and I'm really looking for how to think about into next year with depreciation, so we could get our gross margin set based on whatever expansion or contraction we're all forecasting. Thanks a lot.
Jamie Samath: Yes. For Q4, you're not really seeing significant depreciation and expense reflected in the range that we provided. That's really more next year as some of the manufacturing capacity in facilities come online. What you're seeing in Q4 really is a little bit of FX given how the rates have moved, a little bit of slower progress in some of the line transfers and product cost reduction plans that we have, that's not a large delay. It's just slightly slower than we had planned. And then there's some mix dynamics reflected in Q4. They now to be relatively small, but those are the dynamics as to why gross margin range for the year is at the midpoint, slightly lower than what we had previously. With respect to how '24 is shaping up, what I would just say is, as Gary said in his prepared remarks, we'll see some variability in gross margin over the next several quarters is the depreciation expense and the ongoing efforts to improve our product costs, particularly on the Ion side. And frankly, there are some accumulated inefficiencies just in our global manufacturing operations. They built up over COVID and because of the supply chain issues that we encountered that we're addressing. And a number of those will take time for us to resolve. So I'd say let us give you '24 guidance for gross margin when we get to January because I think we still have to work through those plans.
Robert Marcus: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We'll go to the next line, Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Travis Steed: Thanks for taking the question. I guess to follow up on that. I know on the prepared remarks, it sounds like Gary said, manufacturing improvements for new products and other complex projects. So just curious if you could elaborate on some of those new products and complex projects and what those are that's impacting the gross margin.
Gary Guthart: Yes. On the product side, we have real work to do on Ion. Ion is well accepted by the customer base, growing quickly. We need to iterate and drive manufacturability and manufacturing costs on Ion. So that was mainly what I was referring to. Some of the accessories in the SP line are real opportunities. We want to be assertive there. So on the product side, that's most of what the reference is.
Jamie Samath: Just one other element. We are in-sourcing a high-volume accessory on the multiport side as part of in-sourcing that there's some differential automation in the line there. And so ramping that, there's some work to get that to be at our targets.
Travis Steed: Great. Helpful. And coming into this year, on the procedures, some of the swing factors were China, staffing pressures and COVID. And I imagine like going into '24, there's bariatrics in China, some of the swing factors. Maybe you could just talk about some of the swing factors on 2024 procedures, pluses and minuses and do you think China and bariatrics are still going to be growing and adding to the growth in procedures in '24?
Brian King: Travis, this is Brian. I guess thinking of 2024, nothing really to share at this point. Clearly, I think when we get into January, we'll be able to give you a bit more insight. But I guess I'll just leave it at that for now.
Gary Guthart: Let me just pick up two topics you hit. On the China side, I think the procedure demand side remains robust. I think there's some government policy activity that's putting a little bit of a chill in the market. Some of that is economics, so price caps and value-based pricing and some of it is in any corruption probe that is giving hospitals some pause moving forward with other new programs. We'll see. I think the China side is likely to -- some pressure on the China side is likely to persist for several quarters. On the bariatric side, I think we'll find a new normal in the next few quarters. It's hard to predict exactly when that will happen. We'll see that play out in the marketplace.
Travis Steed: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We go to next line, Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, your usage-based leasing program has gotten some scale. Can you talk about the utilization rates on those systems relative to the average? And any other themes you could share?
Gary Guthart: Sure. I will turn to Jamie here on kind of utilization rates. So why don't you kick that off?
Jamie Samath: Yes. There's two ways to look at it, Larry, what is the absolute utilization rate compared to a regular leasing compared to a purchase arrangement. They are very similar. Actually, the tightness on the mean between those three structures is very tight. Within those arrangements, you generally have a target procedure level that reflects success of the program for the customer and the economic objectives that we have. And if you accumulate again, the portfolio they run at slightly above the targeted procedure levels that we have embedded in the contracts. So they have run very well so far, and it's one of the reasons why we and the customer have expanded those so quickly in recent times.
Larry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And leasing in the U.S., where do you see that going? I mean, it was almost -- it was over 70 this quarter and last quarter. Have we plateaued? Or does that continue to go higher?
Jamie Samath: On a global basis, we expect the proportion of placements that are leased to continue to find. U.S. is pretty high, as you pointed out, Larry, 70% this quarter, 78% last quarter. There will be some larger IDNs that just routinely prefer to purchase just because of how that affects the metrics that are important to them. But even in the U.S., I think there's some room for that to continue to creep up a little bit, obviously, running out of room. We found a number of U.S. customers have really appreciate that as a way to manage through what are totally managed capital budgets.
Larry Biegelsen: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have Brandon Vazquez, William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon Vazquez: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe my first one, I wanted to talk a little bit about general surgery, that's obviously been a nice growth path for you here in the U.S. My understanding is it's a little less penetrated international. What do you think needs to happen in the international markets to kind of get on that steep part of the adoption curve for general surgery as well? Are they kind of seeing time lines and catalysts in the U.S?
Gary Guthart: Sure. Thank you for the question. On -- one way to think about it is that general surgery comprises both procedures that are done where cancer is the underlying cause and others that are benign indication. On the cancer as an underlying cause, we're seeing nice early growth in several OUS markets. So there, I think that's healthy, and we're enthused. I think reimbursements are generally in place in many of the places that we are operating. I think that's what good in clinical data coming out has been supportive. I think that as you think about benign indications, we're seeing some of the beginnings of benign indications in some markets, there may be reimbursement work or education of insurers that has to be done for those to progress further. So in that setting, we'll have additional work to do as it plays out.
Brandon Vazquez: Great. And then maybe last one from me as a follow-up, I think last quarter, you guys were talking a little bit about launching, I believe it was called Case Insight, kind of the software AI platform. Any kind of updates on that end? How are things going so far? And maybe what's in the future for that program? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Thank you for the reference. So Case Insights is our machine learning AI program that looks at surgical science. We have our first installs and first case is going that we had talked about it with you last quarter. So far, early feedback, and it's super early. We're really in the early innings here is very good. Case Insights builds on some prior research that we had done with academic centers on something that we have described as a computational observer. So we have some pretty good scientific underpinnings for it. We expect over time that, that program will feed insights into different parts of the hospital's analytic system from giving specific guidance to learning surgeons and care teams about where they might improve their technique and skills to giving suggestions to programmatics, about efficiency and total cost management, to giving other insights for the company about how to improve procedures in the OR. So, we think it's a long-term set of investments around really the science of surgery. We remain extremely excited about it. While we do have some revenue for it, we don't expect it to be a serious revenue driver. We think it is an ecosystem complementary. And we look forward to describing it more to you as time goes on.
Brandon Vazquez: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We'll go next to Matt Miksic, Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matthew Miksic: Hi, thanks so much for taking the questions. So, I had one question on - follow-up on kind of the bariatric trends and one on sort of the system leasing effect on pricing. So bariatric, if you could maybe talk about - you mentioned the global percentage of procedures that bariatric represent maybe - just the growth trajectory of that business in the second quarter and the third quarter. And whether that's something you expect to grow at a similar trajectory or bottom out in your comments on folks getting on the drug for getting off saying a year or two to kind of suggest maybe a longer path to stabilization in that business line within. And then I'll just follow-up briefly with the question on ASPs, if I could? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Jamie, you might speak to kind of what the size or percentage of that business is for us. A little bit of the acceleration or deceleration trend.
Jamie Samath: Yes. And I want to make sure I got it right, Matt. So come back to me if I have the wrong questions. But our total bariatric business represents about 4% to 5% of global procedures. What you saw in Q2 was in the U.S., which is where the majority of our bariatric procedure volumes are, in the U.S., the growth rate declined to about the U.S. average. And then what we saw in Q3 was it modestly decline a little further in Q3. Were those your questions?
Matthew Miksic: Yes. No, that's very helpful. And then I guess, just your expectation - you framed out in terms of your guidance, but I mean, is this - I mentioned it just because one of the other competitors actually saw a decline, I guess, in laparoscopic bariatric or some combination a lot been open in the third quarter, single-digit decline. But it doesn't seem like you're in that zone, right? You're still at or slightly below your average growth rate in the U.S. Is that - am I hearing your answer correctly?
Jamie Samath: Well, if you take our procedure growth in bariatrics relative to market, we're taking share and have been for some time. So the fact that we had double-digit growth in Q3 relative to another company that had a decline, that's just a reflection in part of the fact that we are taking share in bariatrics and continue to do so, even though there's an impact to overall bariatric surgery, because of GLP-1s.
Matthew Miksic: Got it. That's very helpful. And then the other - just ASP, I understand system ASP you give is not - does not - as your U.S. leasing goes up, as I understand it, those leased systems in the U.S. are not included in that ASP calculation. So if you could maybe just speak to - I don't know, the way in which the increased leases have affected ASP or whether this is straight up year-over-year decline that suggested in sort of the overall numbers that you provide, if that's a clear question?
Jamie Samath: So everything you described is correct. Generally, although there can be exceptions for mix effect, generally U.S. system ASPs when purchased are accretive to the global average. So in effect, as leasing has grown significantly in the U.S., that in and of itself has an adverse effect for calculated system ASP. The other thing that you see then with now a greater proportion of systems used to calculate that system ASP being international FX can have an effect. If you look on a two-year horizon. So for example, the exchange rate in Japan based on how the U.S. dollar has strengthened, there's a 30% to 40% impact over a two-year basis on system ASP in Japan as translated. So, there is a geographical effect. And if you look at a long enough horizon, there's an FX effect in what we described in Q3 was in terms of the year-over-year decline in ASP, also a dynamic relative to pricing. And that's really just as we expand our existing customers who are looking for a third, fourth, fifth system, those tend to be slightly lower ASPs than you've seen previously when they were greenfield accounts, I would say that in China, we do see some competitive dynamics with respect to pricing just given the number of lower local players. And so, there's been some competitive effect on system ASPs in China specifically. We don't really see that in other markets to this point.
Matthew Miksic: Thanks so much for the color.
Operator: And we'll go to the next one, Jayson Bedford, Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Jayson Bedford: Hi, good afternoon. Gary, I think you've expressed your views on the role of bariatric surgery in a GLP world. I'm just wondering if these views have changed in any way over the last quarter or two? I know it's not a lot of time, but the adoption of this class of drugs is obviously ramping quickly. And then just as kind of a related follow-up, getting back to Robbie's question on the potential impact of GLPs beyond bariatrics. Do you expect an impact from some of your other procedure categories as GLPs get adopted?
Gary Guthart: Okay. On the first one, I think Myriam described it well. Our position on GLP-1s as it relates to bariatric surgery, I think she hit it well at the start of the call, no reason to reiterate it here. On the issue of potential impact beyond bariatrics, there may be some, although I think as you think through the analysis, I think it will be modest. And here's how we think about it. If you look at obesity and diabetes as risk factors in other domains and other diseases for which surgery is performed, they are sometimes positive correlated risk factors for that disease. In some weird cases, they are negative in cases that it's actually protective against disease. So it's not entirely obvious. In most of the diseases that we treat as we look at it, it is not the dominant risk factor. So as we look out and think about what could it be like in our TAM, we can kind of do a back of the envelope analysis. It is really early. I don't think anybody knows the exact number. What I can say is that it's not the dominant risk factor in most things that we look at. And we have a very large unpenetrated TAM. I think we're still in the early innings of what we're trying to work on. So, if these drugs are highly effective at avoiding other types of diseases, we will cheer. I still think we have a lot of upside opportunity to pursue.
Jayson Bedford: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: And we go to next line, Ryan Zimmerman, BTIG. Please go ahead.
Ryan Zimmerman: Thanks for taking the questions. I think you spoke about some of the new indications in SP. If I'm not mistaken, I think there's a 30-day follow-up on the thoracic trial. But I'm curious if you could expand maybe when complex colorectal and thoracic cases potentially could become growth drivers for SP adoption and when you expect those - not just those trials to wrap up, but potentially clearances in the U.S. with that?
Gary Guthart: Sure. Myriam, I think you're best to answer that.
Myriam Curet: Yes. So, we are hoping to submit everything in the foreseeable future. After that, as you know, there's at least a 90-day turnaround for the IDEs and then - excuse me, for the clearances. And then after that, we will have to put training together - and they'll see launches together. So I can't really give you a time line for when that would be, but we know what the work is that needs to be done, and we are starting and moving forward on that.
Ryan Zimmerman: Okay.
Gary Guthart: Our biggest steps are get the data arranged to get it into the FDA and work with them to get clearances. And then as Myriam says, we'll go through a staged commercialization. So you can expect submissions in the first half of '24 and then response thereafter.
Ryan Zimmerman: Thank you, Gary. One of the other things, and I don't know if it's direct to you, Gary or Jamie, but you did talk about an opportunity to lower product costs as supply chain stresses ease and I know there were some comments earlier about '24 gross margins. But stepping aside from that, can you quantify the opportunity potentially for what that looks like? Have you gotten your arms around - I know Marshall has been kind of shepherd in these processes. But at what point can you give the Street more color on what that opportunity looks like to drive gross margin gains?
Jamie Samath: We have very well detailed plans for each of the areas that we're focused on. The teams have the capability and skill. It's going to take some time. I think the best way I would answer the question is we see a path of overtime probably in the midterm to get back above 70% gross margin.
Ryan Zimmerman: Thank you, Jamie.
Operator: We go to next line, Anthony Petrone, Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.
Anthony Petrone: Maybe one on China and one on pricing on instruments. When we think about the quota size that National Health Commission in China put out, its new quota is 559 systems. Just wondering on anticorruption, could that shift that number over time whether it be that just fewer capital dollars going to projects or just from a timing element, because things are getting elongated. And then the pricing question would be on instruments and accessories. The company put a 5% price increase in their first one in 14 years. Chairman Powell came out and said, look, inflation is going to be persistent and elevated for quite some time. If inflation stays high, could another 5% price increase beyond the table for 2024? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: With regard to the capital side in China, I'll jump into that. I think demand for our systems and for the procedures they support in China, raw demand is really high. So it's really being limited or titrated by policy. I don't see - I haven't heard anything that says people want to go back and revisit or lower the quota, I think that would be resisted by customers who are looking for purchases. So, I think it's more around delay and a kind of a timing thing and how long it is hard to predict, but months, not weeks. On the pricing side, I'll speak to a general principle rather than projecting '24. What we try to do is a couple of things. One is be an outstanding manufacturer, really get high quality at low cost, and make sure that we can invest in manufacturing prowess to do that. I think that's really powerful for us, gives us enormous flexibility to meet the customers' needs, kind of where they are. With regard to pricing, we look at a couple of things, certainly price to us, cost to us, but also price elasticity, what the customer can do and achieve and that varies by market. And I think, we've become increasingly sensitive to and sophisticated at understanding pricing. So raw material pricing and core inflation to us is an input to our pricing. That's why we took price up this last year, but it's not the only thing, and you shouldn't expect us to be purely algorithmic tracking inflation on its own.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Michael Polark of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Polark: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I have big picture one modeling long-term. There's an investor presentation out earlier this year and it - Intuitive identified 6 million procedures globally for multi and single port for which you currently have line of sight. And on that same slide, identified that there's 20 million soft tissue surgery procedures overall. And if I look at where you're today, you're approaching 40% of that 6 million. And so my question is the delta between the 20 and the six to 14 kind of - how do you expand the six towards the 20? And what are the major unlocks that you expect over the next three to five years that will move the six towards the 20 and kind of your feel for the pace of addressing more of the global procedure pie?
Gary Guthart: Yes, it's a good question. I think the general tools that we use to get from six to 20 are kind of three buckets. Some of them are clearances in new markets. So making sure that a market we can address has access to the technologies that we already have. So when you think about something like Ion, for example, Ion is not yet available in all the markets in which we operate as it operates that it starts to open what we can do. That's kind of one bucket. New indications are another one that some of the work that Myriam described earlier. That starts to open a new opportunity for us as we broaden the applicability of our platforms to new types of surgery and intervention. The third bucket or another bucket is reimbursement. There are places where we think additional data, is required to get insurers to engage a little bit differently and open the market. And then lastly, there are new products and technologies that we're working on that we are not yet described, that we think - allow us to provide new solutions that are competitive in the marketplace. Each of those operates on a little bit different time line. So it's not - I can't give you a simple synopsis of how fast each one runs. Some of them take a lot of years, some reimbursement things or long lead. A product development can be long lead. Other types of access can happen more quickly. But that's a set of plans that we lay out. We're pretty disciplined about laying out, what we want to do over time over a multiyear time horizon. And that's how, we start to open that market. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the Quadruple Aim. There are more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision the future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. And that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-20 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Q2 2023 earnings release. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Brian King. Please go ahead, sir. 
Brian King: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. 
 Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2023 and Form 10-Q filed on April 20, 2023. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 
 Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. 
 Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2023. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary. 
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in the second quarter with strong procedure and utilization growth and strong capital placements. Our product operations teams continue to build capacity and deliver in a dynamic supply chain environment as customers increasingly rely upon us for routine use. 
 Our research and development efforts continued to build momentum in the quarter, including positive development milestones for our Intuitive ecosystem, including systems, instruments, accessories, digital tools and new indications. 
 Turning first to procedures, growth in the quarter was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery and gynecology for benign conditions, particularly in the United States. General surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Colon and rectal procedure growth was healthy. Global procedure growth was also strong in the quarter, led by a recovery in China and continued strength in Japan, Germany and the U.K. 
 Ion procedures showed continued strength with 145% growth in Q2 of '23. SP procedure growth was accretive with 40% global growth in the quarter, driven by accelerating growth in the United States. 
 On the capital front, we placed 331 systems in Q2 compared with 279 systems in Q2 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands at 7,900 multiport da Vinci systems, 435 Ion systems and 142 single-port da Vinci systems. Overall, our capital placement trends reflected demand for additional capacity in multiport, strong interest in our Ion system and stable demand for SP as we build our SP indications. 
 System utilization defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter grew 9% globally year-over-year, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems. We believe real-world evidence of improvements across the quadruple aim from better patient outcomes to surgeon satisfaction and lower total cost to treat per patient episode underpin this increasing utilization. 
 Turning to our finances. Our revenue grew 15% in the quarter. Our capital and operating expenses were within our spend guidance, reflecting continued investments in R&D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints and capital amortization. We will continue investing in R&D, manufacturing and commercial operations to serve our global markets at industrial scale. These investments are likely to be lumpy over the next couple of years as significant operations expansions and other projects complete. 
 Taking a step back, we have found that the quadruple aim is the right north star for us, focusing on demonstrable improvements to outcomes across specific procedures and patient populations, increasing patient and care team satisfaction and lowering the total cost to treat per patient episode. 
 As electronic medical records have been adopted, we have partnered with our customers to analyze this data, building real-world evidence and big data approaches to measure quadruple aim improvements within countries, regions and health systems. Paired with our ecosystem investments in training services and products and powered by digital tools that can generate actionable intelligence from surgical data, we can help our customers analyze their programs, recommend and support actions to improve performance and lower total costs. This integrated business system is catalyzing our customers' goal of strong MIS programs by servicing actionable and measurable steps. 
 Our approach is scalable for us too, working for our da Vinci platforms and for Ion and opening the door to future opportunities. 
 Turning to our ecosystem investments. We're making solid progress extending our offerings to new clinical domains and new regions. For da Vinci multiport, we recently obtained NMPA registration for Xi local production in China. This means our da Vinci Xi will be able to compete for the locally sourced tender subset of the recently released updated national quota. 
 Our da Vinci SP team achieved several milestones recently. We completed patient enrollment for our colorectal and Thoracic IDE trials, continued our first phase of launch of SP in Japan and submitted our CE mark dossier for SP in Europe. 
 Turning to Ion. Our team installed their first Ion system in the U.K. and initiated first cases. For our digital tools, we have initiated our Phase I launch of CASE Insights, our name for our computational observer. CASE Insights is a tool that works with the da Vinci system and hospital data to build AI models that find correlations between surgical technique, patient populations and surgical outcomes. Our first phase of launch builds on work over the past few years with our clinical research partners to refine objective performance indicators and link them to actionable changes to improve outcomes, shortened training times and improve surgical program efficiency. 
 We think these computational tools can make a significant impact using real-world and real-time data to improve skills and outcomes and to inform future product and automation opportunities. That said, features can be built quickly but long-term validation is arduous. We're a science-driven organization and will work through validation pathways in pursuit of long-term success. We do not expect material revenue from CASE insights for the next several quarters. 
 In closing, our core business has momentum. We see a significant long-term opportunity to improve the quadruple aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail. 
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. 
 Global procedure growth in Q2 of 22% and reflected U.S. procedure growth of 19% and 28% procedure growth outside of the U.S. Procedures in Q2 benefited from higher patient admissions as hospitals, particularly in the U.S. catch up with patients whose diagnosis and/or treatment was delayed during the pandemic. 
 Consistent with our comments last quarter, our contributions to procedure growth from surgeons new to the da Vinci platform was strong, reflecting both the strength of our training capabilities and an increasing number of graduates of residency and fellowship programs who are trained on da Vinci. Within one of our target procedure areas, bariatric surgery, our growth rate in the U.S. slowed during the quarter. Some customers have indicated that they are seeing increased patient interest in weight loss drugs. It is too early to conclude if the slowing growth is a temporary pause as patients evaluate these new drug therapies or if it's a trend that continues. 
 We believe that during the quarter, da Vinci continued to gain market share in the bariatric surgical market. Our U.S. procedure growth of 28% reflected strength in China, the U.K., Germany and Japan. Strong procedure growth in China was driven by a continued recovery from more recent COVID-related impacts and a favorable comparison to Q2 last year, which was also impacted by the pandemic. 
 Consistent with our comments last quarter, growth in non-neurology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 35% driven by increases in colorectal, hysterectomy and thoracic procedures. 
 Turning to other key metrics. In Q2, the installed base of da Vinci Systems grew 13% to just over 8,000 systems driven primarily by demand for additional capacity given procedure growth. Average system utilization grew almost 9% year-over-year reflecting an increasing mix of short duration benign procedures in the U.S. and customers prioritizing use of their existing assets given the financial pressures they face. 
 With respect to capital performance, we placed 331 systems in the second quarter ahead of our expectations. Capital strength in the quarter included a higher number of placements to our distributors and a higher number of multi-system deals in the U.S. relative to recent trends, reflecting in part, certain placements accelerated into Q2 from future quarters. 
 Despite Q2 system placements being ahead of our expectations, customers, particularly in the U.S. appear to be cautious in their capital spending given ongoing financial pressures. We placed 279 systems in Q2 of last year, which, as a reminder, reflected a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered during the quarter. 
 Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, second quarter revenue grew approximately 17%. Recurring revenue represented 85% of total revenue as compared to 72% for the full year 2019 and grew 20% over last year, driven by procedure growth and an increase in the installed base of systems under operating lease arrangements. 
 Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we placed 157 systems in the second quarter compared to 150 systems placed last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 174 systems in Q2 compared with 129 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 76 into Europe, 33 into Japan and 16 into China compared with 78 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 15 into China in Q2 of last year. 
 During the quarter, the China National Health Commission published the 14th 5-year quota of 559 robotic systems. For those systems awarded to our JV under the new quota, we expect a significant majority to be placed in 2024 through 2027. We are seeing increasing participation of local competitors in tender processes under the national quota. In addition, during 2023, we have experienced pricing pressure in China as a result of provincial government policy changes and competition. These dynamics create greater variability in the outlook for our procedure, system placement and revenue performance in China. 
 In Q2, 60 of the 331 systems placed were trading transactions compared to 56 trading transactions in the second quarter of last year. As of the end of Q2, there are approximately 500 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 97 are in the U.S. 
 Leasing represented 50% of Q2 placements compared with 42% for both last quarter and last year. In the U.S., 78% of system placements in Q2 were under operating lease arrangements compared to 59% last quarter. The higher rate of operating leases in the U.S. is primarily driven by an increasing customer preference for our usage-based leasing models in part due to capital budget constraints and continuing financial pressures faced by many of our customers. 
 In addition, some customers are choosing leasing structures to preserve flexibility to upgrade to next-generation technology. As a result of these dynamics and the earlier stage of our leasing program with OUS customers, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. 
 Q2 system average selling prices were $1.39 million as compared to $1.47 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in system SPs was primarily driven by a higher mix of X placements for purchase deals and geographical mix. We recognized $12 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $24 million last quarter and $23 million in Q2 of 2022. Da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,840 compared with approximately $1,780 last quarter and $1,900 last year. 
 On a sequential basis, higher [ INA ] per procedure was driven primarily by the [ INA ] price increase we described last quarter and customer ordering patterns. 
 Turning to our Ion platform. In Q2, we placed 59 Ion systems as compared to 41 in Q2 of 2022. Second quarter Ion procedures of approximately 12,700 increased 145% as compared to last year. During the quarter, we placed our first Ion system in the U.K. market and in this early phase of our European launch, we are focused on the collection of clinical data in support of our reimbursement strategy. 12 of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, compared to 10 systems last quarter. SP procedures grew by 40% and average system utilization growth accelerated from last quarter's 12%, increasing by 14% compared to Q2 of last year. 
 Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter was 68.5% compared with 67.2% last quarter and 69.2% last year. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to a higher mix of Ion revenue which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business and lower system SP. 
 As we described last quarter, improving product costs and manufacturing efficiency is a priority for our teams over the medium term. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 12% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased headcount added throughout last year, higher variable compensation, increased prototype expenses and increased expenses associated with customer training in support of procedure growth. 
 Pro forma operating expenses represented 33% of revenue in Q2 compared to 35% of revenue for the full year 2022, reflecting in part planned leverage in our enabling functions. 
 Capital expenditures in Q2 were $178 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.3%, consistent with our expectations. Second quarter pro forma net income was $507 million or $1.42 per share compared with $415 million or $1.14 per share for Q2 of last year. 
 I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $421 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $308 million or $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. 
 We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.1 billion compared with $6.6 billion last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities, proceeds from employee stock exercises partially offset by capital expenditures. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023. 
Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 22% year-over-year compared to 14% for the second quarter of 2022 and 26% last quarter. In the U.S., second quarter 2023 procedure growth was 19% year-over-year compared to 11% for the second quarter of 2022 and 26% last quarter. 
 Q2 growth continued to be driven by strong growth in procedures within general surgery, with particular strength in cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Bariatrics growth was healthy in the quarter but as noted earlier, growth was lower than in prior periods. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure volume grew 28% compared with 22% for the second quarter of 2022 and 28% last quarter. Second quarter 2023 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in general surgery, primarily from strong growth in colorectal procedures, followed by growth in thoracic procedures. 
 Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in the U.K., Germany and Spain. In all the regions noted, procedure growth was driven by colorectal and hysterectomy procedures. 
 In Asia, growth was led by China, where we saw a continuing recovery in procedures that were impacted by COVID and benefiting from a favorable comparison to procedure volume that was impacted in the same quarter a year ago. 
 Procedure growth was led by strong growth in urology, namely prostatectomy and kidney procedures. In Japan, growth was led by general surgery with the largest procedure contributions coming from colorectal and gastrectomy procedures. While still at earlier stages of adoption, India and Taiwan, both demonstrated strong growth in gynecology and general surgery procedures. 
 Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. 
 This past May, [ Dr. Zhang ] from the second affiliated hospital of [ Chongqing ] University in China, published a systematic review in meta-analysis comparing outcomes of robotic right colectomy procedures with outcomes associated with laparoscopic right colectomy. Published in techniques in Coloproctology, this meta analysis evaluated a total of 15,241 patients across 42 studies with over 2,700 subjects in the robotic right colectomy group and over 12,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group and included outcomes associated with the entire population as well as outcomes for both intracorporeal and extracorporeal anastomosis. 
 Looking at the population overall, the authors reported among other outcomes, an approximately half day shorter length of hospital stay, 51% lower risk of conversion to laparotomy and a 12% lower risk of complications with a robotic approach. Notably, in the subgroup specifically comparing outcomes for procedures within Intracorporeal anastomosis. The robotic right colectomy group was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay by approximately 16 hours and a 65% lower risk of conversion to laparotomy. Within the extracorporeal anastomosis subgroup, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 40% lower risk of overall complications. 
 The authors concluded in part that, "The safety and efficacy of robotic right colectomy is superior to laparoscopic right colectomy, especially when an Intracorporeal anastomosis has performed". 
 Turning to a clinical study reporting outcomes for robotic-assisted and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, [ Dr. Murai ] from Danbury Hospital in Connecticut, published outcomes comparing lobectomies performed with either approach using the National Cancer database. This study focused on patients with complex etiology, such as non-small cell lung cancer who have received neoadjuvant therapy at [ N1.2 ] disease or had a tumor greater than 5 centimeters and compared 9,500 subjects with over 2,100 in the robotic arm and over 7,000 in the [ bats ] arm. 
 Notably, when analyzing rates of conversions to open, the authors reported a 7.7% lower rate of conversion to open in the robotic arm with an approximately 2x higher risk of conversion associated with the [ bats ] group. The authors concluded, "In summary, our analysis of the National Cancer Database suggests that robotic lobectomy for complex lung resections achieved similar perioperative outcomes and [ R0 ] resections [indiscernible] lobectomy with the exception of a lower rate of conversion to thoracotomy". 
 I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 18% to 21%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 20% to 22%. The low end of the range reflects uncertainty around the duration of elevated procedure volumes with patients returning to healthcare, continued slowing of bariatric growth rates in the U.S. and macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending. At the high end of the range, we assume macroeconomic challenges do not have a significant impact on hospital procedure volumes, and bariatric growth rates in the U.S. continue at the rate we saw in Q2. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints. 
 Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. 
 With respect to operating expenses. On our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 15%. We are also updating our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range $600 million to $620 million in 2023, narrowing the range from our previous estimate of $600 million to $630 million. 
 We are increasing our estimate for other income which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $160 million and $180 million in 2023, an increase from our previous estimate of $140 million and $160 million. The increase primarily reflects the rise in interest rates. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $800 million to $1 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. 
 With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We go through the first question from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. 
Larry Biegelsen: Gary, just two for me. One big picture question on AI and second, on procedure growth. So AI is obviously having its moment in the sun here, Gary. I'm curious, where is Intuitive spending time in applying AI? Is it imaging, movement of the robot, training? I'd love to hear your thoughts, and then I have one follow-up. 
Gary Guthart: Yes. Well, I'll start on AI. Let's talk about what it is. For us, it's a suite of digital tools that rests on a baseline and then can be built upon using various machine learning techniques including computer vision. We've been at it for some time. We started the Internet-of-Things for surgical robots over a decade ago. We built the baseline of cyber secure privacy-compliant pipes that allow us to get access to the data. So there's some foundational work that was important. That's kind of step 1. 
 Step 2 is to collaborate with customers and aggregate data that is meaningful. AI is only as good as the quality of the data that you feed it. And so for us, that has been robot data, some other data in electronic medical record data in partnership with our customer base. We've been doing that for several years now. From that, I think you can start to do analytic inspections. You can do analysis on the data, look for correlations. Sometimes it's pretty simple math. That gets you big data explorations, some simple things that we can do to help our customers become more efficient and to expose variation. 
 Over time, you can invest further in things like computer vision, which we have been doing and into predictive analytics, the idea that you can look at surgical data science, understand the variation of patient populations and what's happening in surgery and start to create tools, digital tools that can help improve outcomes or speed learning curves or lower operating costs and we're going to work on all of those things. 
 So of the things you mentioned, we have our toe in the water in many, and we've had for some time. As I said in the script, the feature content can be moved pretty quickly. I think the validations take real time to do well, particularly outcome-based or interventional validations. And so we're going to go through and do that with real rigor. So I expect us to continue down that pathway. 
Larry Biegelsen: That's very helpful. And then on procedures, I'm just wondering, you talked about some catch-up in Q2. How are you thinking about how much of the backlog of deferred procedures is still left? You talked about the diagnostic procedures on the last call. And any color on what you're assuming for bariatrics here for the rest of the year? And does that mean international will continue to be stronger than the U.S.? 
Gary Guthart: Let me talk a little bit about, I think, the patient population that moved to the sidelines during the pandemic, and then I'll turn the assessment over to Jamie. On the kind of the pandemic response, it's hard to exactly estimate how many folks would have been in diagnostic pipelines that did not get their tests. We do look at the data that's available to do that. I don't think it will clear in just one quarter. I think our past experience on these things is that lower utilization happened over a several year period, and it will probably take many quarters for it to fully recover. How long that is, I think it's very, very hard to estimate. So far, so good. 
 You asked a question about bariatrics, I'm going to turn that over to Jamie. He spoke about it a little bit in his prepared remarks. 
Jamie Samath: Yes. What we saw in Q2 was that growth rate slowed. We have some input from customers that the level of patient interest is such that patients are now considering drugs versus surgery. It's unclear yet based on that set of inputs from customers the duration of that evaluation by parents and patients and obviously, it's layered. So what we did for our guidance was we just said at the high end for the remainder of the year, the bariatrics growth rate in the U.S. is consistent with what we saw in Q2. And at the low end, we said that the growth rate continues to slow a little bit over the course of the year as patients become increasingly educated about the weight loss drugs. And obviously, there's a number of factors that patients have to consider with respect to those drugs, cost, side effects, what happens if they come off the drugs and regain weight, et cetera. But I think from our perspective, we're early in understanding what the longer-term impact will be. 
 Customers have said that they have confidence that there is a role for surgery in weight loss and that will endure over kind of the longer term. What happens in for the rest of the year, I think we'll see. 
Operator: We'll go to the next question. Go to the line of Travis Steed, Bank of America. 
Travis Steed: I did want to ask about China and the China quota and how you think the opportunity is now that there's more local players, but you also have the local version of Xi and on the bariatrics, just a quick follow-up on that, too. Is that around 100,000 procedures. Just trying to think about sizing that their active surgery opportunity or impact? 
Jamie Samath: We've set the market size in the U.S. is about 200,000 procedures annually for what we think is a good mesh for robotics. And in terms of where we are in penetration, we're kind of at the -- if I put it in quartiles, we're at the beginning of the second quartile. What was your first question, Travis? 
Travis Steed: It was on China and the China quota and how to think about that opportunity there versus last quarter, given there's more local players, but now you have the local version of Xi. 
Jamie Samath: Yes. I mean, obviously, there's increased opportunity in the sense that this quota is 559 systems relative to the prior quota of 225 systems, but you also have now 5 local players. There will be government interest in success of local players. We do believe the surgeons care about capability and feature set and so the extent to which da Vinci continues to be differentiated, I think, is to our advantage. 
 In the -- and we are seeing those local players increasingly participate in tenders with respect to how that quota will be allocated. So it gets allocated from the central government to the provinces and then it goes through tender processes. So there is some time before that results in placements and that's why we said in our prepared remarks, we think the bulk of the subset of that quota, our JV wins will be in '24 through '27. 
 I also described some dynamics that create greater variability with respect to pricing pressure and increasing competition. So I think for us, that's something that we're going to watch carefully over the next year or so. 
Travis Steed: Great. And a question for Gary. Just I heard the comment on hospitals leasing more to preserve the upgrade option for the next-gen system. So maybe just talk high level, the pipeline comments on the FDA and kind of supply chain bottlenecks that you saw last year? And then and how you're thinking about incremental upgrade to the Gen 4 versus kind of new platforms? 
Gary Guthart: Sure. On the supply chain health side, we are seeing fewer pockets of challenge, but some pockets nonetheless. So there's been significant focus and attention to make sure that we're supplying our customers what they need as we go through a pretty nice procedure growth curve. So they're calling out improvement in the breadth of supply chain challenge, but cautioning that there are still some pockets that need attention or require attention. 
 We continue to work on multiple things. As you know, we're working on next generations of our platforms, in general, that is a routine activity for us. How we make the decision between upgrading a current generation versus moving it to the next generation really is around customer value of that switch and the convenience and economics of doing an upgrade versus a platform changeover. And we expect to do some of both. We are usually working on the next two generations because of the time it takes to develop a platform, not just the next one, but the next one after that. And current time is really no different. 
 We're pleased with the performance of our engineering teams and prosecuting those upgrades and technologies. What I will say is prioritization wise, what we care about is can we improve patient outcomes in a real way or open a new population of patients to the benefits of [indiscernible] surgery. So we look at that. We look to improve the surgeon and care team experience, whether that's in their ergonomics or their workflow and the like with which they perceive our systems. We work to improve efficiencies of overall programs. We'll work on things that make hospital programs more efficient and we work to lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. 
 And when we find feature sets and technologies that do that, then we get pretty excited about them and drive them hard. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. 
Robert Marcus: Congrats on a really nice quarter. I heard the comment on prototype expenses are increasing. So I figure I'll try my luck here, and I know you're not going to tell us when a next-gen or if the next-gen system is coming. But I want to ask around just implications if and when one does, you have a lot of leases now. Do they have the option to upgrade? And will that come through at higher revenues? And how do we think about the prototyping expense and really what that's for? 
Jamie Samath: Yes, I'm not going to be specific on the prototype expense and it's distributed across a number of programs. Prototype expenses tend to be lumpy within Q2 relative to the comparison point. It just so happened to be a quarter where that was one of the direct drivers of our expenditure. Nothing more than that, I would say. 
 As we've grown the proportion of the installed basis under leases, I think it's about 2,000 systems now that are under lease in the installed base. Generally, they have a technology obsolescence clause. That's kind of in part a reflection of customer feedback from when we launched Xi. So that's routinely in our operating lease arrangements and that cause generally gives customers the opportunity to change that existing lease to the lease of any new next-generation technology. And that is not a specified price, by the way, that's to be negotiated. So I wouldn't say anything more about price. 
Robert Marcus: Great. And maybe, Jamie, one more for you on the financial side. Another nice quarter of cash flow generation, north of $7 billion on the balance sheet. Interest rates, high inflation, high as well. How are you thinking about maximizing the cash here? And how should we think about the priorities? 
Jamie Samath: With respect to capital allocation, I think our priorities are consistent for how they've been for some time now. Our first priority is to invest in the business, both in capital expenditures, which as you've seen by our guidance are relatively high to our history this year and in organically investing in operating expenses. 
 Second is to acquire technology externally that gives us a differentiated capability or accelerate us in the marketplace. That's generally license arrangements, IP acquisition or tuck-in acquisitions. And we continue to look at returning cash to shareholders opportunistically. And I think that's served us well. If you look at kind of the last 18 months, we repurchased 12.6 million shares for $3 billion at an average price of $234 and we did that opportunistically in large part because it reflects kind of the stage of the company. We're relatively early in the robotics space where we look for growth, and I think that's served us well. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Rick Wise, Stifel. 
Frederick Wise: Gary, I recently visited several European hospitals and robotic programs. And frankly, and honestly came way more impressed than ever with Intuitive's European commercial presence reputation. But I was particularly intrigued to hear one particularly high-volume robotic surgeon talk about what's next. And it seemed less focused on systems and very much focused on enabling technologies that make everything better, faster, clearer, et cetera. And they included things like integrated CT image overlays during procedures. That aspect of augmented reality tools that bring CT and surgery together, next generation firefly. He was dreaming of virtual [ rulers ], dual [ SureForm ] 45 and 60 staplers and haptic feedback. I mean that was -- it was fascinating to hear. Are these the kinds of innovations that are priorities for you? And are these the kind of things you want to make docs like that excited about? Is that what you're -- the kind of stuff you're working on? 
Gary Guthart: You had a long list. I think several of those are important and things that we have talked about and have shared with the world. I think the idea of higher confidence ability to identify tissue in real time for the surgeon, and we can do that in a few different ways. So the florescence imaging, that you described and other advanced imaging technologies that give surgeons the ability to see beyond the surface of the tissue and beyond what you can see with normal white-light imaging, we absolutely think that's helping clinical outcomes and we're excited about and investing in image fusion or data fusion, and that's the CT overlay, the segmentation of preoperative MR and CT scans and the ability to use that in real time during the case, we think, can change outcomes and change efficiency in the OR. 
 Other types of analytic and sensing capabilities, we think are really powerful and important. And to the earlier question about AI, machine learning, machine vision, these things work together. So high-definition images that show you things beyond the surface of the tissue plus computer vision, plus AI models can give you some predictive analytics that I think are really powerful and would help surgeons get to better outcomes, reduce complications. So I am like that surgeon, quite excited. 
Frederick Wise: Great. Just a follow-up, quick follow-up. You -- I think, if I remember correctly, took a 5% across-the-board price hike on instrumentation. I don't know if I'm remembering correctly, that was to kick in like June 1. Did that happen? Did it help the quarter? And should I assume that it's going to be a little bit of an offset or a little bit of an instrument tailwind in the second half and beyond? 
Jamie Samath: It was largely implemented in Q2, Rick. It wasn't effective at the beginning of the quarter, I'd say, roughly half of the quarter benefited from the price increase. Our estimate for the impact of the price increase is consistent with what we said last quarter, roughly about $100 million impact to revenue and profit for the year. Again, you get kind of half an impact in Q2 and the full impact in Q3 and Q4. 
Gary Guthart: A reminder, our motivations on that, we've been quite conservative on pricing. Our input pricing in the last few years has gone up in terms of raw material and labor content. We have offset most of that through efficiency and scale advantages, but we felt like it was time to share some of that with our customers, and that was what was behind the price increase. 
Operator: We go to the next line. I have Richard of Truist Security. 
Richard Newitter: Richard Newitter here. Jamie, maybe for you on the guidance, 20% to 22%, very healthy. I'm just curious on thinking about the low end of the range there. You specifically mentioned you contemplate bariatric surgery growth trends, eroding a little bit from the 2Q levels. What's the pace of erosion there that you're thinking about that would get you to the low end? Like how much erosion, how did you establish a baseline for yourself? 
Jamie Samath: Yes, I don't want to get too specific there, Rick, given just the relative size of bariatrics in the U.S. to our overall procedures. We can obviously see the progression between Q1 and Q2, I'd call it a moderate, steady progression in the model in Q3 and Q4. The overall impact on that is obviously a function of the size of the bariatrics business for us. It's not some dramatic falloff. 
Richard Newitter: Okay. That's helpful. And just maybe sticking on the same topic here on bariatrics. Just thinking about the areas that you could offset that as we think of procedure categories geographically or by category that could be nearing an inflection point like Bariatric got to several years ago, what procedure categories or geographies would you call out that you think could lead to overage there to offset any potential incremental slowdown in bariatrics, if any? 
Jamie Samath: I'm not going to answer that in terms of overage, but I'll say where we're seeing healthy growth. If you take our largest 7 markets, which is a focus for us, so China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, U.K. and Italy, what you're seeing in those markets is generally a progression beyond urology into the next set of cancer procedures. It's market by market. But generally, that's hysterectomy, thoracic and colorectal procedures. And we're seeing them on the early stages of an adoption curve, and that's why we've talked about our OUS business now is about half outside of urology or beyond urology. This quarter, it grew 35% that subset. That's consistent with what we saw in Q1. That subset also grew 35%. So I think we're excited in those larger markets where we have that focus and continue to drive the adoption curve in that next set of procedures. 
 If you look at market by market, you have some unique dynamics in China. You see liver and pancreas procedure doing well in Japan, treatment of stomach cancer in Korea, for example, you see thyroid. But it's really that next step procedures. 
Gary Guthart: Just I want to just step back a little bit on bariatrics, we've had a few questions on it and just make a point. As we go out and talk to surgeons, we talk to obesity physicians and pharmacologists, which we do in terms of our diligence. The sense here is that the market is going to adjust to the change in treatment pathway as it relates to drugs. However, it doesn't look like the drugs are a cure and may not be a fast path to cure and a strong consensus among those we speak to, including people who are not surgeons, physicians who are not surgeons is that the surgery and other interventions are going to remain an important part of the interaction. 
 As the -- in the near term, I think the market will adjust to understand what role the drugs will play but they're not cures and the discontinued rate remains pretty high, and the populations of patients who don't get any benefit from the drugs also remain significant. So I think there's an adjustment period here and we should be aware of it. But that may become a tailwind in future quarters as folks work through those sets of pathways and look at long-term and durable solutions into the obesity challenges. 
Operator: We'll go to the next line of Ryan Zimmerman, BTIG. 
Ryan Zimmerman: Maybe one for Jamie. On the expense management standpoint, I mean, procedures are going up a little bit faster than expense -- OpEx guidance by about 50 basis points or so in and so I'm just wondering, Jamie, kind of what your views are on expense management and letting some of that leverage flow through as we think about not just the back half of the year, but into '24 versus maybe reinvesting that in R&D? 
Jamie Samath: Yes. For this year, we have specific objectives with respect to leverage in our enabling functions, which we've described previously. And that's a set of objectives that I think we intend to fulfill. 
 Largely, what you see in the adjustments we've made to our operating expense guidance for this year is a function of our top line performance, both in variable compensation and in the number of reps we need in the field to support a higher procedure base. For the rest of kind of operating expense set of investments, we're holding to -- we're largely holding to our plan for this year. 
 When you project into '24, I'm not going to kind of describe the direction of where spend will go relative to procedural revenue, we'll do that in January. But you have a couple of dynamics. We have a significant CapEx investments this year, $800 million to $1 billion, that will start to create incremental depreciation expense next year. A chunk of that will be in COGS and a chunk of that will be in operating expenses. So you have kind of an operating expense headwind coming there. And those investments being largely facilities, they are planned for the medium term, meaning they're inefficient for a period until you get to full occupancy or full utilization. 
 On the other side, we'll continue to look to leverage our enabling functions into '24, where that shakes out, we'll do in January because we have to complete our planning process in the back half of this year. 
Ryan Zimmerman: Okay. That's very helpful. And then I noticed, and this is kind of directed at Gary, you commented on this a little earlier, but you disclosed for the first time, I believe the proportion of lease agreements that are usage-based versus fixed operating lease agreement. And I'm wondering, Gary, what that says and the trends that we see there about the health of our customers and what their preference is over time? 
Gary Guthart: Yes, it's a good question. I think we see that one size doesn't fit all. There are some folks for whom they still remain happy about capital purchases. They see it as the cheapest way for them to access systems. They have high confidence and they're going to buy. There are some folks for whom capital is tight, scarce and or they're interested in future technology protection clauses, and they would rather lease. And there are some folks who are looking at expansions, are a little bit unsure about how fast volume might ramp and for them, usage-based arrangements give them some protections about ramp timing and speed. 
 Our analytical capabilities are pretty good, and our finance flexibility is pretty good. And as a result, we'll have that conversation pretty direct way, and I think the market starts to settle where it settles. If you ask, do we have a strong preference for one of those models, the answer is not really. 
Jamie Samath: The motivation by the way, for the new disclosure was simply the rate at which those adoption of those models have grown, we felt, okay it was important to be transparent as to what portion of operating leases and placements that structure was. If you kind of assess all of our usage-based arrangements in aggregate life today relative to usage patterns and economic objectives in total, on average, they're slightly above our expectations. So they performed well so far. That's obviously a blend across different customers and systems. Some are overperforming, some are underperforming. But I think part of the way that we've operated the program is to look carefully. Is it actually reducing barriers for accelerated growth of our customers? And is it producing the economic results for us and our customers and as we and customers have gained confidence, that's part of the reason why it's expanded the way it has. 
Operator: And we'll go to the next line. Go to the line of Andrew Ranieri, Morgan Stanley. 
Andrew Ranieri: Maybe just one other follow-up question on bariatrics, but maybe a different angle. I mean, we've talked to some general surgeons too, that mean they're kind of suggesting that these new drugs might even open up potential procedure categories where these patients might not have been suited to have surgery. Gary, kind of like what are your views on this? Do you see some near-term disruption from GLP-1s on the bariatric side but maybe this opening doors for other procedure categories? 
Gary Guthart: Yes. That's a little bit of the narrative we're hearing too. We go out and canvas our customers pretty widely. There may be a role for kind of new adjuvant use of drugs and then as you say, that may condition some patient populations to be beneficiaries of surgery downstream. There may be folks who start the drugs, get the benefits that they were hoping for, but either the side effects or the cost or the change lifestyle that the drugs are implying, make it hard to sustain. There's a fair amount of that in the literature. So that may -- that population may look for other solutions. 
 I think we're just going to have to work through it and see. What we don't see yet is a magic pill, one that cures it and doesn't require behavior change or other lifestyle modification and that -- and it seems unlikely. And as a result, I think we're going to see an adjustment, how long that adjustment period lasts, none of us know. But we know that there will be a role for surgical and mechanical intervention after the fact. And I think we're well positioned. And as Jamie had mentioned, it looks like even in the current environment, the share continues to move our way. So we're going to stay close to it. 
Andrew Ranieri: Is there any procedure categories that are coming up in your conversations that stand the most benefit? 
Gary Guthart: It's a good question. We're probing probably too soon for us to give you a definitive answer. 
 Right. That was our last question, and thank you. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim. Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and, ultimately, a lower total cost to treat. 
 We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that's less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. 
 Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-18 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Quarter 1 2023 earnings release. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. 
 I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Brian King. Please go ahead. 
Brian King: Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. 
 Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2023. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 
 Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. 
 Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results. And I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2023. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. 
 And with that, I will turn it over to Gary. 
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Use of our products grew strongly in the first quarter versus a year ago, helped by positive surgical trends and strong execution by our team. New capital installs were likewise strong as customers built their da Vinci and Ion system capacity to meet demand. Revenue grew 14% on the back of this continued adoption. 
 Some manufacturing and supply challenges this quarter negatively impacted our product margins. This is an opportunity for sharper execution going forward. Our R&D and innovation engines are making good progress with the strength in Ion adoption, progress in our digital efforts and indication expansions for Ion and SP. Overall, our core business remains strong with some near-term procedure and product cost dynamics that we'll discuss today. 
 Starting with procedures, we saw a surprising strength in the quarter led by general surgery in the United States and procedure growth beyond urology outside the United States. On a procedure basis, cholecystectomy, bariatric surgery and hernia repair led the way. 
 All our major regions performed well. Standouts included India, Spain, U.K., Japan, Germany and Italy. U.S. performance was significantly above trend, and China is recovering from lows in Q4, though not yet meeting our expected 2023 run rate. 
 Given that first quarter of the year exceeded our procedure expectations, we're reviewing underlying drivers. The return of patients to health care providers and diagnostic pipelines post-pandemic continues, with evidence of both an increased patient census and some diagnostic pipelines running above pre-pandemic levels after several years of lag. We also see a commitment by our hospital customers to work through staffing constraints to maintain surgical volume. 
 Lastly, customers are expressing confidence in our products as a clinically and economically sustainable path forward for minimally invasive surgery. Taken together, we see continued share gain from open surgery and laparoscopy in several procedures and in several countries as evidence accumulates in our favor. 
 Strong growth in procedures and a capable product portfolio has supported a healthy capital placement quarter. Worldwide, we placed 312 da Vinci systems and 55 Ion systems in Q1 compared with 311 da Vinci systems and 34 Ion systems in Q1 2022. 
 Capital placements were healthy in the United States, our distribution markets, the U.K. and in India in the quarter. Our product portfolio and our teams are competing effectively with the offerings of a growing set of competitors, notably in OUS markets where customers have had more time to evaluate the relative strengths of our offerings. 
 Procedures per system per quarter grew 13% during Q1 versus a year ago. Systems are being used more hours per operating day, and customers are increasing the mix of shorter-duration procedures. Both trends are good, long-term indicators for our business. Customers are finding more value in their systems and are moving more of their procedure volume onto our devices compared to other surgical approaches. 
 Turning to our finances. Our revenue growth of 14% reflects the strength of our procedures and capital placements, while average selling prices remained stable. Our margins were pressured primarily by charges taken in our stapling line due to a raw material lot non-conformance that necessitated scrapping instruments. We also experienced lower manufacturing yields during the bring-up of new production lines in our high-volume production facilities to support multiport accessory and Ion catheter growth. Customer availability was briefly impacted for stapling but has since recovered, and we're working on bringing customer stocking levels back to their prior levels. For our Ion catheters and our multiport accessories, we're investing in capabilities to increase yield and robustness in the face of rising demand. We have worked through the issues that drove the bulk of these scrap charges in the quarter.
 Finally, in SG&A and R&D, we're spending roughly to plan while continuing to pursue productivity improvements post-pandemic. Jamie and Brian will take you through our finances and forward outlook in more detail shortly. 
 On new products and indications, we've had a productive quarter. We received our CE mark for Ion, and we expect to launch in the U.K. as our first entry into the European region. As we focus on scaling Ion, we initiated our first high-volume production lines in our Mexicali facility, increasing production volume 50% over just the prior quarter. 
 In digital, our simulation subscription installed base grew 36% year-over-year as virtual reality training becomes more deeply embedded in the training pathway. Our intuitive hub installed base grew 41% year-over-year and utilization during da Vinci cases grew 80% year-over-year as customers use our Intuitive Hub computing system to record and analyze procedures more routinely. 
 Turning to SP. We received new indications for SP in the United States through a 510(k) clearance in urology, covering simple prostatectomy, removal of a noncancerous prostate for treatment of advanced benign prostate hyperplasia. We also installed our first da Vinci SP system in Japan, and they completed their first set of cases. 
 For 2023, our priorities are as follows. First, we're focused on increased adoption for our priority procedures in countries through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution. Second, we're pursuing expanded indications and launches for our new platforms. Third, we're focused on excellence and continuity of supply, product quality and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses. And finally, we're pursuing increased productivity in our functions that benefit from scale. You can see from our first quarter results the relevance of these priorities and our urgency in pursuing them. 
 I'll now turn the time over to Jamie who will take you through our finances in greater detail. 
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. 
 Before I dive into the details of our Q1 results, I will expand on the 2 areas of note in the quarter, and as Gary highlighted, procedure growth and gross margin. 
 Global procedure growth in Q1 of 26% came in well above our expectations with notable strength in the U.S. where procedures also grew by 26%. As a reminder, procedures in Q1 of last year reflected an adverse impact from COVID in the early part of the quarter in the U.S. and the latter part of the quarter in Korea and China. We believe that the return of patients to normalized health care routines, including diagnostics, and improved staffing levels have positively impacted this quarter's procedures. However, it is difficult to precisely characterize or estimate the degree or duration of this impact. 
 Looking at the monthly trends in the U.S., January and February were particularly strong relative to historical seasonality. However, in March, we saw more normalized growth rates. Outside of the U.S. procedure growth of almost 28% was also ahead of our expectations, with growth outperforming expectations across all our major international markets. 
 In the first quarter, non-urology procedures represented roughly half of our total OUS procedures and grew 35% from quarter 1 of last year. Brian will provide additional commentary and our updated procedure outlook later in the call. 
 Pro forma gross margin in Q1 was below our expectations at 67.2%, lower than last quarter's 68.2% and last year's 69.8%. Q1 results reflected onetime adverse impacts of approximately 100 basis points relating to manufacturing-related issues and an increase in inventory reserves, as Gary detailed. While we largely resolved these onetime items in the quarter, we see opportunity to strengthen our manufacturing operations and improve product costs. This is a priority for our business unit and operations teams and aligns with our capital investment plans, as we described on last quarter's call. 
 Turning to other key metrics. In Q1, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew 12% to almost 7,800 systems driven primarily by demand for additional capacity given procedure growth. Average system utilization grew 13% year-over-year, significantly above long-term trends, driven by notable strength in procedure volumes in January and February and by an increasing mix of shorter-duration benign procedures in the U.S. While we do not expect this level of utilization growth to continue, we actively support our customers as they increase utilization of their da Vinci systems which, in turn, lowers their per procedure costs. 
 With respect to capital performance, we placed 312 systems in the first quarter, ahead of our expectations, with notable strength in OUS markets. Current quarter placements were roughly even with the 311 systems we placed in the first quarter of last year. There were 67 trade-in transactions in the quarter as compared to 108 last year. Excluding trade-in transactions, net new system placements increased 21% over the first quarter of last year. As of the end of Q1, there are approximately 560 Sis remaining in the installed base, of which approximately 110 are in the U.S. 
 Q1 revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 14%. On a constant currency basis, first quarter revenue grew approximately 17%. Recurring revenue represented 81% of total revenue and grew 21% over last year driven by procedure growth and an increase in the installed base of systems under operating lease arrangements. Within I&A revenue for our advanced technology categories, stapler and energy, revenue grew a combined 26% over Q1 of last year. 
 Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. In the U.S., we placed 141 systems in the first quarter, lower than the 186 systems we placed last year, reflecting a decline of 51 systems associated with trade-in transactions. Outside the U.S., we placed 171 systems in Q1 compared with 125 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 101 into Europe, 16 into Japan and 18 into China compared with 78 into Europe, 19 into Japan and 9 into China in Q1 of last year. First quarter system placement performance in Europe included 32 placements in the U.K. driven by timing of the NHS budget period, which closes each year at the end of March. We placed 12 systems in India, a quarterly high for us, which, in part, stems from our recent procedure growth there. In Q1, procedures in India grew 55%, albeit from a relatively small base. 
 Reviewing the capital performance in the quarter, we do not expect the strength in U.K. and India to repeat in the remainder of the year. Customers, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, continue to be challenged by staffing, inflation, debt servicing costs and other financial pressures. And as a result, we expect customers to continue to be cautious in their overall capital spending. 
 Leasing represented 42% of Q1 placements compared with 42% last quarter and 35% last year. We are increasingly seeing customers address system access and capital budget barriers by choosing our usage-based leasing models. The proportion of placements under this structure continue to increase, particularly in the U.S. As a result of this trend and the earlier stage of our leasing program with OUS customers, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. 
 Q1 system average selling prices were $1.47 million as compared to $1.43 million last quarter. The sequential increase in system ASPs was primarily driven by a lower mix of trade-ins. We recognized $24 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $16 million in Q1 of 2022. 
 da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,780 compared with approximately $1,820 last quarter and $1,870 last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $40, and ordering patterns in China had a negative impact of approximately $50 per procedure as our channel partners continue to manage their inventory levels in a dynamic environment. On a sequential basis, the primary driver of the decline in I&A per procedure of $40 was customer ordering patterns in the U.S. 
 Turning to our Ion platform. In Q1, we placed 55 Ion systems as compared to 34 in Q1 of 2022. First quarter Ion procedures of approximately 10,200 increased 159% as compared to last year. During the quarter, we received CE mark clearance for our Ion platform in Europe where we will initially focus on the U.K. market and on the collection of clinical data in support of our European reimbursement strategy. Regulatory processes for Ion continue to progress in Korea and China. Ten of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, including our first placement in Japan following clearance last quarter. SP procedures grew by 37% and average system utilization increased by 12% compared to Q1 of last year. 
 Moving on to the rest of the P&L. As previously referenced, pro forma gross margin for Q1 was 67.2%. And in addition to the onetime impacts described earlier, pro forma gross margin reflects the impact of higher component and labor costs and, relative to the year-ago period, a stronger U.S. dollar. Gross margin for our Ion platform is currently considerably below our da Vinci business, resulting in an adverse mix impact to gross margin given the higher growth rates of our Ion business. The key area of focus for our Ion and manufacturing teams over the next 18 months is to improve supply stresses, strengthen manufacturing capabilities and lower our product costs. 
 I&A prices have remained the same for the life of Xi. However, given the durability of component cost increases throughout the pandemic, we are executing an increase to the list price of da Vinci I&A from approximately 5% over the next couple of months. This increase reflects only a portion of the increased component labor costs reflected in our gross margin. We expect the impact of this decision to be an increase in revenue and operating profit of approximately $100 million in 2023. 
 First quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 20% year-over-year driven primarily by increased head count added throughout last year, higher variable compensation, higher travel costs and increased expenses associated with customer training. Operating expenses were moderately above our expectations due to higher variable compensation and training costs related to our procedure performance in the quarter. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up 1%, including the annual reset of certain payroll taxes. Head count increased by approximately 330 in Q1, of which roughly half are in support of revenue growth. 
 Capital expenditures in Q1 were $197 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity, including automation of certain production lines. 
 Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.1%, consistent with our expectations. First quarter pro forma net income was $437 million or $1.23 per share compared with $413 million or $1.13 per share for the first quarter of last year. 
 I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $355 million or $1 per share for the first quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $366 million and also $1 per share for the first quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on strategic investments. 
 We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.6 billion compared with $6.7 billion at the end of last year. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures partially offset by cash from operating activities. 
 During the quarter, we spent $350 million to repurchase 1.5 million of our shares at an average price of $230 per share. From the beginning of 2022 through the end of Q1 this year, we have repurchased 12.6 million shares at an average price of $234 per share and have $1.1 billion remaining under current Board authorization to repurchase our shares. 
 And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023. 
Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 26% year-over-year compared to 19% for the first quarter of 2022 and 18% last quarter. In the U.S., first quarter 2023 procedure growth was 26% year-over-year compared to 16% for the first quarter of 2022 and 18% last quarter. Q1 growth continued to be driven by strong growth in procedures within general surgery. Specifically, growth was led by cholecystectomy, bariatrics, hernia repair and other procedures.
 Outside of the U.S., first quarter procedure volume grew 28% compared with 25% for the first quarter of 2022 and 18% last quarter. First quarter 2023 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in general surgery and gynecology categories, primarily from colon resection and hysterectomy. Growth in urology continued to be solid led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. 
 In Europe, we experienced strong growth in the U.K., Germany, Italy and France. In all the regions noted, procedure growth was driven by strong growth in colorectal and hysterectomy. Urology was also solid, with particular strength in kidney procedures. Outside of those procedures, in Germany, we also saw strong growth in hernia repair. And in France, growth in lung resection was also strong. 
 In Asia, growth beyond urology was also led by general surgery and gynecology procedures. In Japan, growth was led by colon resection, a newly reimbursed procedure in 2022 that provided the most incremental cases this quarter. Growth was also robust in rectal resection and gastrectomy and continued early-stage growth in kidney procedures. In China, procedures started to recover in February from the impact of COVID, exceeding our expectations for the quarter but still below prior averages. Growth in urology was solid, in particular with growth in prostatectomy and kidney procedures. 
 Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. 
 Starting with the clinical study for benign general surgery, Dr. Courtney Collins from Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center published outcomes comparing robotic versus open retromuscular ventral hernia repairs in older adults using prospectively collected data from the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative, a national hernia-specific registry. 
 Published in the Annals of Surgery, over 1,100 patients over the age of 65 were included in a propensity matched analysis, with 350 patients in the robotic arm and approximately 750 patients in the open arm. This study reported the median length of stay associated with the robotic-assisted approach was 1/4 of the length of stay for patients undergoing an open repair, with a 1-day stay in the robotic-assisted arm and a 4-day stay in the open arm. 
 While complication rates were similar between both groups, it was notable that median 1-year quality-of-life scores using the HerQLes quality-of-life survey tool trended favorably for patients in the robotic-assisted arm. The authors concluded, in part, that the results suggest that robotic approach may have at least short-term benefits to appropriate older patients undergoing retromuscular ventral hernia repair, including shorter length of stay with relatively low risk of complications, with the important note that surgeon comfort and knowledge of the likely complexity of a repair should always guide operative approach in any patient. 
 Now turning to a report published in January of this year. Dr. Sameh Emile from the Cleveland Clinic Florida reported outcomes for robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic resection of T4 rectal cancer in the British Journal of Surgery. This study, leveraging data from the National Cancer Database and after a 1:1 propensity score matching, compared 470 patients undergoing a minimally invasive resection for nonmetastatic T4 rectal cancer, with 235 subjects in each of the laparoscopic and robotic-assisted cohorts. 
 Notably, rates of conversions in the robotic-assisted group were approximately half the rate of conversion in the laparoscopic group, with 8.9% in the robotic group versus 17.9% in the laparoscope group. Further analysis demonstrated that risk of conversion to open was 45% lower in the robotic-assisted group when compared to the laparoscopic group. In addition, patients who underwent a robotic-assisted procedure had a 1 day shorter length of stay compared to patients in the laparoscopic arm. The authors concluded, in part, that robotic-assisted resections of T4 rectal cancer were associated with a significantly lower conversion rate and shorter hospital stay than laparoscopic surgery. 
 I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 16%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 18% to 21%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic and macroeconomic risks. 
 The low end of the range still assumes continued choppiness with COVID hospitalizations, uncertainty with the timing of the capital quota in China for the remainder of the year, macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending and a moderation in procedures from elevated levels experienced in January and February this year. 
 At the high end of the range, we assume COVID-related hospitalizations around the world continue to decline throughout 2023, a capital quota in China is available and macroeconomic challenges do not impact hospital procedure volumes. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we experienced at the start of the pandemic. 
 Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. 
 With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 9% and 13%. We are increasing our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. The increased operating expense growth reflects higher variable compensation and other costs related to higher procedure growth performance. 
 We are also updating our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between $600 million to $630 million in 2023, a decrease from our previous estimate of $610 million to $640 million. We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $140 million and $160 million in 2023. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $800 million to $1 billion for planned facility construction activities. 
 With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. 
 That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll first go to Travis Steed with Bank of America. 
Travis Steed: I'll start out with the 26% procedure growth. Can you just comment a little bit on how much of this is just a better hospital environment, better procedure environment, versus maybe some uptick in share gains from robotics? And a little bit more color on the January, February versus the March, just curious if you think this is some kind of temporary catch-up here or some sustained better procedure environment kind of moving forward. 
Jamie Samath: Travis, this is Jamie. I think there are 4 drivers on the 26%. We do think there's a little bit of a soft comp on the base period given some impacts from COVID in Q1 of '22. You have 3 other drivers. We think there is some backlog effect from patients generally returning to more normalized health care routines given the effect of the pandemic over several years. Included within that is diagnostic pipelines, we see the last year or so of diagnostic pipelines being above pre-Covid levels. Second effect, there is some strength in the U.S. in general surgery, particularly behind general surgery. And in our OUS markets, the non-urology side of our procedure categories are growing nicely. .
 We also think that relative to Q4, staffing has improved. It's not where it was pre-COVID, but I think that's allowed for some incremental procedures to be performed. We don't have good estimates as to where the kind of various outperformance is between those categories that we described, market data lags there. Certainly, there's some market share gains, particularly in benign general surgery in the U.S. 
 What was the second part of your question, Travis? 
Travis Steed: Just more about the January, February versus the March and if it was more of an early part of the catch-up, I think you answered part of that, versus some sustained better environment here into April. . 
Jamie Samath: Yes. January, in particular, was very strong. That also probably reflects in part a little bit of the comp. February continues to be strong, and I characterize March as a normalized growth rate. I'm not going to give you the percentages, though, I think that can be misleading. Early part of April, it's difficult to look at just a couple of weeks. But I'd say generally, it's consistent with what we've seen in March. We've seen some third-party data through end of February, just with respect to total U.S. inpatient admissions, and that shows kind of the same trends in terms of a strong January, February. 
Travis Steed: Great. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about the price increase on I&A. Is it like across the board for just the U.S.? I assume, but I wanted to clarify that. And the math I was doing of about 150 basis points on margin but the gross margin guide still staying the same at 68% to 69%, so I just wanted to make sure I understood the moving parts on the margin side and how you're incorporating that into the overall margin guidance. 
Jamie Samath: Yes. So the 5% is in the vast majority of our markets, a couple of smaller markets, where local dynamics are such that we have to take a look at that more carefully. That doesn't go into effect for the full year, that's in the next couple of months that we'll implement that. I think if you look at the gross margin impact of the $100 million, depending on where you're modeling revenue, I think you have to do it with and without revenue and gross margin dollars to do the impact to gross margin percentage. I think it's less than the number that you described. And yes, it is reflected in the gross margin guidance that we provided. So what you have there is the puts and takes of the Q1 performance, our updated outlook for the rest of the year and then you add in the effect of the price increase. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. 
Robert Marcus: Great. I just want to say congrats on a great quarter. Maybe if I could ask on placements, the net placements were well above consensus here in the first quarter, really strong showing, flat with last year pretty much, despite lower trade-ins. But that comes with your comments that it's still a fairly tight capital environment. So in a normal environment, how much better do you think you'd be doing on placements? And are you seeing an improvement at all in the capital equipment environment? It's certainly not holding you back here. But I'm just really curious where you think you could go if the environment was a bit healthier. 
Jamie Samath: Yes. I would say that the environment is still challenging for hospitals. There's no question that they are encountering relatively significant financial pressures. Generally, we see customers, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, prioritizing their capital investment dollars based on where they see the greatest ROIs and where they have opportunities to gain market share. And so us, where we see that evidence is in where they start to have procedure growth, that means they're out of capacity and they look to invest in da Vinci to expand capacity given the economic evidence that they've accumulated with the experience of their programs. 
 Hard to answer your question directly in terms of what would the capital environment be if it were in, let's say, normalized times. For us, I think we're focused on this period on offering customers flexibility in how they acquire capital, meeting them with their financial objectives and serving their objectives in expanding their robotic programs. 
Robert Marcus: Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Jamie, as we think about your OpEx progression through the year, it came in a bit higher than the Street had in first quarter. How should we think about that flowing through the rest of the year? And was there anything or any kind of big quarters that we should be thinking about in our progression through the year? 
Jamie Samath: Yes. I would say roughly, depending on where you are in the range, Q2 and Q3 operating expenses should be roughly similar to Q1, and you start to see a less of effect just from the payroll tax reset in Q2 and Q3 as those max out, and you should see Q4 seasonally higher. 
Operator: Next, we'll go to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. 
Larry Biegelsen: Gary, you've talked about competition potentially lengthening the capital placement cycle. But my question is, if there's an effort by a competitor to discount I&A by 30% or so, how would this impact your procedures? And secondly, Gary, why is this the right time to increase price in I&A? And I had one follow-up. 
Gary Guthart: Yes. On the first question of what's real pricing out there, there's a few competitors out there, a couple are trumpeting marketing claims about how much they're going to reduce I&A pricing. When we see them in tenders, when we actually see what's written down, we don't see the marketing claim. So I don't know that that's been realized yet or if it's something they want to do in the future, if they're really going to deliver, I don't know. .
 But we do have real-world evidence of engagement in our OUS markets with most of these competitors. And what we find is that the reality is we have a very strong portfolio, we can hit multiple price points because we have different systems that can hit it at different places. The other thing that goes on is that it's more than just whatever a company supplies to get to the total price per procedure. So if a new competitor enters and they have a short procedure set, in other words, they don't have everything you need, the customer will have to go to third-parties to fill it out to finish the case. Often in marketing materials, they don't make that clear, "Hey, you got to have more to get the case done." But in a tender, you do, which is, "Hey, this is all the stuff that it really takes to get a procedure done." 
 So we're feeling pretty good about where we are with regard to our ability to deliver economic value that really matters to our customer. I think that we're having real exchanges with them about what that looks like. So that's kind of a baseline. We have been investing in the virtuous cycle, manufacturing capabilities. Some of the capital you hear us investing is both facilities and automation, getting our factories in the right places in the world for logistics and for labor. We're doing those things to be able to lower our product costs, increase our quality as we get volume. That has been lumpy. I wish it was smoother, but it's been a lumpy process for us. 
 So the timing for us in terms of price increase is really not about a specific issue. It's not about a specific competitive issue or scrap. It's really around looking at the input costs that we're seeing over the last couple of years and component supply that comes to us from others and labor content, labor costs, and saying, "Hey, we're going to have to move a little bit here going forward." That doesn't diminish the other programs that we've done to make sure we're bringing value to our customers, extended life instruments and other price points that we can help them with. 
Larry Biegelsen: That's very helpful, Gary. Just one on Ion, we estimate Ion sales exceeded $140 million last year. It could drive a couple of hundred basis points of revenue growth this year. Thank you for giving the procedure numbers on this call. My question is when are you going to start to break out Ion revenues and just maybe talk about the ramp in Europe. 
Gary Guthart: So the first question of kind of breakouts in your estimates, I'll let Jamie answer that, and I'll talk a little bit about Europe. 
Jamie Samath: It's a little early at this point. It's 2% to 3% of procedures and revenue. I think we want to give it a little more time, get a little more experience in the marketplace, execute some of the commercial activities that we have for the year. When it becomes a bigger portion of the total, maybe a year from now, we would look to do some guidance and give greater disclosure. 
Gary Guthart: On Europe, this first year, as we go in, we'll be relatively modest in terms of revenue and installs. I think we'll start the process. We're excited about some of the sites and clinical trial work that we need to do. We do have to do some evidence generation in Europe. We do want to look at some of the reimbursement capabilities that are going to be important for broader market access. So year 1 is really about establishing evidence, having the right conversations and building the database so that reimbursement and broader use can be deployed. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. 
Jayson Bedford: Just a couple of questions. Just on China, I assume there was a backlog built in December and January and part of February. I don't know if you commented on March trends there, but can you comment on procedure growth in China in the quarter? And to the extent that you do believe there is a backlog, do you expect a bolus of growth in that geography over the next quarter or 2? 
Brian King: Jayson, this is Brian. Good to hear from you. If you recall really at the end of last year, we had highlighted that we saw a significant impact from COVID at the end of the quarter to procedure volumes. And what we saw was that, that actually carried over into the beginning of this year. What we were highlighting in our prepared remarks was we definitely saw an impact in China continue through January, started to see a recovery in February and a bit into March. I guess I would say overall, I think procedures in China exceeded our expectations, but it just still was below our overall, say, long-run averages over time. So it's probably all that I could say. Anything beyond that, I couldn't say if there's anything different in March versus February. 
Jamie Samath: I would just add, Jayson, there may be still some unmet backlog in China. If there is, it's probably relatively small, and it's captured within the procedure range that we provided. 
Jayson Bedford: Okay. And just another quick clarification question. The supply challenges impacted margins. Was there an impact on revenue in the quarter? I'm just curious how long it will take to replenish the normal inventory levels at the customer level. 
Jamie Samath: Yes, there was not an impact to revenue that I'd highlight in Q1. It was really just the gross margin impact of about 100 basis points that we highlighted. With respect to inventory, if I just look at the big picture, we've been trying to replenish inventory targets for each of our critical parts for some time. We've been supply constrained for a good portion of the pandemic. Inventory health improved in Q1 relative to Q4, but we still have a number of parts where we have to get to our target levels. And that will probably take us over the course of the rest of the year. 
Gary Guthart: Just a note, supply chain shocks through the last couple of years depleted inventory. Now we're building it back up. And given some of the lack of smoothness, we're probably holding a little more inventory than we would in more smooth times. That little additional inventory increases risk at some point. So we saw that in this quarter, we will work through it this year, but I think that risk still exists a little bit as inventory levels are higher than they were in the last 2, 3 years as we recover. 
Operator: And next, we'll go to Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. 
Richard Newitter: Congrats on the quarter. I have 2 quick ones on SP. I think you had said that FP procedures grew 37% and in the quarter. If you could just remind us kind of how that stacked up for the last 2 quarters. And then the second one on SP, just the new indication there for BPH, how significant is that? And maybe just talk a little bit about how expansive that is for you? And then I have one follow-up. 
Gary Guthart: Yes. I'll let Jamie take the trend data, and I can talk about BPH. 
Jamie Samath: The '22 procedure growth rate for SP, I think... 
Gary Guthart: It looks like Brian is looking it up. I'm going to do the second question first, and then Brian is going to come back and save the day. On BPH, so there are a lot of different treatments for BPH. It's a quite common condition. At smaller prostate sizes, when it's caught earlier, there are pharmacologic approaches. There are some minimally invasive in-office approaches. Those tend to delay further onset. They don't tend to cure. So folks, over time, fail out. And as they fail out of those other procedures, surgery becomes increasingly important. 
 SP, early days, looks to be quite interesting. It's a minimally invasive approach. It can deal with advanced stage disease that we think other approaches are not handling well at all. And so as we get involved, I think that's another arrow in the quiver of an SP urologist. I think that helps them. We're already engaged with those customers, and it may give us a lead to participate in a bigger part of that market as time goes on. 
 Back to the trend data, I'll go back. 
Jamie Samath: Yes. If I just take '22 as a whole, SP procedures grew 38%, so relatively consistent. 
Richard Newitter: Great. And just on the benign procedure commentary, it was such an enormous step-up, particularly in the U.S. I appreciate the easier comps. But were the benign procedures, that potentially saw a little bit of disproportionate lift this quarter, confined just to general surgery benign procedures? Or was it also inclusive of benign GYN? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of where this procedure strength really derived. 
Jamie Samath: Relative to trend lines, we saw benign strength in GYN also. So benign GYN growth rates were higher than we've seen in recent times and higher than long-term trend rates. And we think that speaks to kind of this backlog of patients' return to normal health care routines, et cetera. That's part of what's reflected in those growth rates. 
Gary Guthart: At the risk of being redundant, I think there's 2 concepts that are worth stitching together. One of them is that utilization went up 13% in the quarter procedures per system per year. So folks are using capital more frequently. There was an increase in the benign side. So we're seeing a rotation of mix, putting of those procedures onto systems that they own already. That was a big step-up. I think it speaks to how hospitals are thinking about robotic-assisted surgery programs and how they're thinking about capital. 
 And the simple answer is they're looking to see greater capital productivity out of what they already own and they see through real-world evidence, the ability to look into their own electronic medical record data, that their outcomes are really good with robotic-assisted surgery and their contribution margins are really healthy. So rotations on to those systems are happening. And I think that's been an acceleration at least in this quarter. So we'll see if it holds through the year, but I think it tells you a little bit about the capital environment and it tells you a little bit about the commitment toward robotic-assisted surgery, particularly in higher-volume, shorter-duration procedures. 
Operator: Next, we'll go to Matt Taylor with Jefferies. 
Matthew Taylor: So I just wanted to ask one. Because you had this outperformance in the procedures and talked about increased procedure guidance for the year, could you unpack that at all geographically or just by area? It sounds like general surgery is very strong. But just any more color on expectations for procedure growth in these different geographies with some of the fluctuations that we're seeing or by category would be great. 
Jamie Samath: Yes, I would say our major international markets, so in Europe, Germany, France, U.K., Italy; in Asia, China, Japan, South Korea, they all performed well in the quarter. They all exceeded our expectations. And what we're seeing within those markets is nice growth in non-urology, so hysterectomy, colorectal, thoracic, depending on the market. We're starting to see, albeit at early stages, some of those procedures in those markets starting to get into an adoption curve. So I think that we're relatively optimistic on the outlook for those markets. Our expectations are reflected in the procedure guidance range that Brian provided . 
Matthew Taylor: And just one follow-up on the kind of the China disruption, how are you seeing that come back now? Are there any other geographies where you're still seeing any notable disruption and any recovery expectations you can provide? 
Jamie Samath: So I think Brian described what happened in Q1. We saw an impact in January in China. It started to recover in February and March. I think that the dynamics in China are relatively choppy, and I think it's a relatively dynamic market. So rest of the year, I think, there is relatively hard to predict. With respect to COVID impacts in the other markets, nothing that I would highlight. I do think that the financial pressures, staffing dynamics have as much of an impact in many of the European markets as they do the U.S. 
Gary Guthart: Yes, I'll speak to my perspective on China a little bit. I think it's a little bit different market for us than other places. The earlier questioner asked do we think there'll be a backlog and it will recover. Certainly, as they reopen, there'll be a backlog of patients that need to come back to surgery. We're such a tiny part of the overall surgery market, and we're so small relative to the total market size given the constraints of the quota, that how much of that comes to us and go somewhere else is going to be hard for us to predict. We're just going to have to live through it. So that's kind of number one. .
 The second one is the demand side is really high. The demand for additional systems and for training and patient demand for high-quality MIS is really good. We're waiting on clarity on additional quota, which is throttling the market right now. So those are the 2 things that I think have to clear up. We'll see patients come back at some rate. Whether they wait to get a robotic surgery in queue or they jump out of queue to get it, any way that they need to get it, that's going to be hard for us to know personally. And we'll see as the government responds to release of new quota.. 
Operator: And next, we go to Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. 
Andrew Ranieri: Gary, just maybe on placements for a moment, you touched on this earlier. But can you give us any more context specifically in the U.S. of like what you're seeing in terms of capacity expansion versus new accounts, just adopting robotics after 20 years? I would just like to hear your perspective there. And I have a follow-up. 
Gary Guthart: I'll kick the first part on expansion into greenfields versus accounts that are already owned to Jamie. I ask you, Jamie, to think a little bit about there's corporate ownership IDNs and there's hospital-level ownership within those IDNs as to whether they had a robotics program or not. So perhaps tease those 2 apart a little bit. 
Jamie Samath: If you look at maybe a 5-quarter average, Drew, in the U.S., about 20-ish percent of the persistent placements is for greenfield accounts. But those greenfield accounts are really at hospitals that are part of a regional or national IDN that have not had a robotics program. Generally, they have a higher mix of benign procedures, benign general surgery in particular. And as the IDN at large has seen growing economic and clinical evidence for those procedures, particularly on the economic side, they've started to establish robotics programs in those greenfield accounts, again, as part of an existing IDN that we do business with. If you look at kind of the trend line, last couple of quarters, we've seen a little less greenfield mix in the system placements. I don't know that that's a trend. On a 5- or 6-quarter basis, it's relatively stable. 
Gary Guthart: Just adding a little bit to your perspective, as we sit with our IDN-level customers and talk about this, one of the things that has been really exciting for us is, in the last few years, the ability to analyze carefully with the kind of data we can bring and the kind of data those IDNs have in terms of their electronic medical record to both understand which hospitals would benefit from robotic programs and what the total profitability is in their hands when they do it, that resolution has gotten a lot better. The quality of those conversations is fantastic. The confidence, I think, they have to reinvest because they can see the data in their own hands, even if they don't have it at a particular hospital, somewhere in their network, they have it and they can do that analysis. That has changed the nature of the conversation in the last few quarters, and I think you're starting to see a reflection of that now. 
Andrew Ranieri: And Gary, just with about 4,700 systems in the U.S. right now, as you're thinking about competition eventually entering the U.S., kind of what are your thoughts on robotic practices being multidisciplinary in robotic systems versus standardization, which has been kind of a key effort of yours over the past several years? 
Gary Guthart: Yes. Thank you. I think that not all customers are the same. There are different customers that have a different mission. Some customers view themselves as wanting to be test sites for anything that comes out, and they will do that. Some customers want to be training facilities and, as a result, want to be able to train anybody from any setting in allcomers. So we're going to see some cross-system sites. 
 But I think that's different. I think that's not the majority of the market. I think a lot of the market is going to be interested in great outcomes, high applicability of their systems, so that they can be used across multiple procedure categories and serious dependability. These are now being used more frequently. They're a part of everyday surgery for tens of thousands of surgeons now. And I think in that category, the bulk of the market, repeatability, dependability, outstanding outcomes, great access, great regulatory approvals and a lot of confidence in the company that can deliver it, I think those things are going to be assets. We'll see. I don't have a crystal ball. We'll see how it plays out. But so far, so good. 
 We'll go ahead and close from here. Thank you. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions more broadly. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. 
 We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where disease are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. 
 Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months. 
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude the call for today. Thanks for your participation of using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-24 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Quarter Four 2022 Earnings Release. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode.

Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2023. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in Q4 and for the full year 2022. Procedure growth for the full year approached pre-pandemic levels. Installed base growth was solid, and customers concurrently increase utilization of existing systems. Our investments in product development extended our multi-port, single-port and flexible robotics ecosystems through new instruments, accessories, digital products and indication expansions. Finally, the fine work of our operations teams and supply partners largely mitigated the supply chain challenges that persisted through the year. Turning first to procedures. We saw 18% procedure growth for the quarter and the full year. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States, particularly benign procedures such as bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Colon and rectal procedure growth also continued. Strong growth beyond urology outside the US was accretive to our global performance. We attribute this diversification to the value of our ecosystems and our strategic investments in organization, clinical trials, data products and market access. Regionally, the United States, Japan, Europe and India stood out in the quarter and year. Procedure growth in China was hampered by the COVID wave in Q4, with procedures progressively declining starting in November through the end of 2022. Ion procedures showed continued strength, with 218% growth in 2022 compared with 2021, and SP procedures grew 38% over the same period, with the majority of its growth coming from Korea. Global core procedure areas of urology and gynecology moved toward recovery in the year, both exceeding their three-year compound annual growth rates in 2022. On the capital front, we placed 369 systems in Q4 compared with 385 in Q4 2021. For the full year, we placed 1,264 systems compared with 1,347 in 2021. Our installed base growth rate was 12% for multiport, 149% for Ion and 22% for SP in 2022. Overall, our capital placement trends showed sustained demand for additional capacity in multiport and strong interest in expanding capacity for Ion with several hospitals now operating multiple Ion systems in their programs and variable demand for SP as we continue to pursue our additional indications. System utilization is an important predictor of future demand and utilization grew 5% for multiport in the year and 10% for Ion. Utilization was roughly flat for SP over the year, however, utilization increased by 9% in Q4 measured year-over-year as our organization incorporated learnings. Touching on our finances, revenue grew 9% in 2022. Revenue was impacted by the strength of the dollar in the year and the decline of the trade-in population of third-generation multiport systems. Our expenses landed at the higher end of our spend guidance reflecting continued R&D investments that support the growth of our platforms and digital products, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial capabilities, and capital amortization driven by expansion of our global footprint. Structurally, we have been increasing our own capital expenditures as we continue to build the company to supply the globe at industrial scale. This is an important investment as several procedures using our systems have become the standard of care in several countries. We have been vertically integrating key technologies to develop a more robust supply chain and bring important products to market at attractive price points. These investments include increased ownership of our imaging pipelines, strategic instrument and accessory technologies, and software and digital products that allow us to serve our customers. The investments make our business more capital-intensive than years past, in support of industrial dependability, a more robust supply chain, and lower product costs. I'd also like to take a moment to walk through our platform investments. Intuitive starts with the end in mind. Coordinating our efforts to enable our customers' pursuit of the quadruple aim in specific procedures, for example, those in general surgery. We design all our systems to allow for the addition of new functionality over time. For our multiport platform, this design philosophy has enabled us to continuously strengthen our fourth generation da Vinci Xi by adding new regulatory clearances, a new model with the da Vinci X, new instruments and accessories, new imaging capabilities, and new software products. These products include our stapling lot of instruments as well as our advanced energy instruments, which contributed approximately $890 million in revenue in 2022 with revenue growth of 18% in the year and are a key enabler of the general surgery growth discussed a minute ago. We added 65 representative clinical procedure indications in the United States to our fourth-generation multiport platform since its launch. Our multiport indications now spans six surgical categories and total over 70 procedure indications for multiport platforms in the United States today. We routinely improve our platform operating systems with roughly 10 significant fourth-generation OS releases since launch and dozens of smaller software upgrades. We launched our next-generation Xi visualization, Endoscope Plus, and have been integrating digital products, including virtual reality training Intuitive Hub and the My Intuitive app. We expect to launch additional Gen 4 compatible products and operating system software this year. Concurrently, we invest in new generations of our multiport platform that bring new and significantly enhanced capabilities. For our multi-port system development programs, we prioritize as follows. Our highest priority is the improvement of core surgical capability targeting improved patient outcomes, often through innovation in robot and instrument precision, imaging and sensing while focusing on dependability and product quality. Next, we designed to improve usability, care team's skill acquisition and analytic power, including digital products for the operating room, personalized learning for care teams and efficiency analysis and services for surgical programs. Next, we design platforms and their ecosystems that can lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. And finally, we designed with the flexibility to add future capability to systems post launch. Given the time required to design and validate new architectures at any given moment, we're typically developing more than one system architecture beyond that in the market. In the current global regulatory environment, core technology changes often require human clinical trials and substantial review. These are multiyear investment cycles, and we're making good progress. As we start this year, we do not currently expect a new multi-port system launch in 2023. Turning to Ion. Adoption has been healthy based on its ability to meet an unmet clinical need in lung biopsy. We're focused on improving the manufacturability, cost and robustness of iron products to support its rapid growth in the US. We have also submitted a regulatory dossier for a review in Europe, Korea and in China's green channel. We expect clearance in Europe in 2023. We don't have a firm forecast on the time for Ion clearance in China at this time given pandemic related adjustments ongoing in the Chinese healthcare system. Ion is also a platform with strong opportunities for future clinical applications. We're conducting advanced development and clinical research to extend Ion to other indications in the lung. While our Ion flexible robotics offers an opportunity to provide value in the body outside the lung, our focus is on completing what we started for pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons. Our single-port platform, da Vinci SP, has supported strong adoption in Korea and has recently obtained PMDA clearance with broad indications in Japan. We expect first installs of SP in Japan in the coming months. Next, we plan to submit our dossier on da Vinci SP to our notified body in Europe midyear 2023. So far, customer feedback on the clinical utility for SP has been healthy with strong multi-specialty use of SP in Korea. In the United States, some indications have required prospective clinical trials, and we're currently conducting IDE trials in colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery. We're pursuing additional indications for SP beyond these two, and we'll share more information on these indications in 2023 as the requirements for our regulatory pathway for them are established. We're continuing to invest significant resources in R&D, where the portfolio we have under development is positioned to support leadership in existing categories and expansion into new ones. Our capital investments will increase to support supply chain robustness, product cost reduction and global industrial scale. On the SG&A front, we are making some foundational investments, and we'll turn to pursue leverage in enabling functions. Recognizing economic conditions for 2023 are hard to forecast, we're targeting a deceleration of fixed cost growth rate in 2023 relative to 2022. We expect pro forma operating margins to fluctuate in the next several quarters and then improve over the mid-term. In closing, our priorities for 2023 are as follows; first, increased adoption and focused procedures defined by country through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution; second, pursuit of expanded indications and launches for our new platforms; third, excellent performance in the continuity of supply, product quality and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses; and finally, pursuit of increased productivity and our functions that benefit from scale. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2022 revenue and procedures are in line with our preliminary press release of January 11. I will briefly review full year 2022 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail. 2022 procedures grew by 18% as compared to 2021, or 15% on a three-year compound annual growth rate basis. During the year, we placed 1,264 systems at customers, down 6% year-over-year, driven by a decline in trading volumes of 165 systems due to the declining population of SIs in the field. Recurring revenue, which is correlated to ongoing use of our products represented 79% of total revenue and grew 15% over the prior year. Total revenue of $6.2 billion increased 9% year-over-year and grew approximately 12% on a constant currency basis. Pro forma operating margin was 35% of revenue and reflected the impact of several headwinds, FX, supply chain challenges and inflation together adversely impacted 2022 pro forma operating margin by approximately 1 percentage point. During the year, we repurchased $2.6 billion of our stock or approximately 11.2 million shares, and we have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $1.5 billion. Turning to Q4. With respect to capital performance, we placed 369 systems, 4% lower than the 385 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year. There were 110 trading transactions in the quarter, as compared to 117 last year. 51 of the 110 trading transactions were with OUS customers, higher than recent trends primarily driven by customers in Japan and Brazil. As of the end of Q4, there were approximately 620 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 134 are in the US. Given the continuing decline of older generation systems in the field, we expect trading volumes to decline significantly in 2023. Q4 revenue was $1.66 billion, an increase of 7% from last year. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter revenue grew approximately 10%. For full year 2022, revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represented 24% of total revenue. The US dollar has weakened recently, and as a result, on a revenue-weighted basis, using current rates, the US dollar is approximately 100 basis points stronger than the average rates realized in 2022. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the US we placed 181 systems in the fourth quarter, lower than the 235 systems we placed last year, reflecting cautious capital spending by customers, given the macroeconomic environment and a decline of 21 systems associated with trade-in transactions. Average system utilization in the US increased by 6%, reaching an all-time high. Outside the US we placed 188 systems in Q4 compared with 150 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 70 into Europe, 51 into Japan, and 14 into China compared with 63 into Europe, 37 into Japan, and 14 into China in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of the end of 2022, there were 34 systems remaining under the current quota in China. There are now four local competitors that are registered in China and they're active in tenders under the existing quota. Delays in the granting of a new quota in China will constrain our ability to further grow the installed base and limit capacity for procedure growth. Leasing represented 42% of Q4 placements compared with 37% last quarter and last year. The higher lease mix was primarily driven by the mix of customers in the US who prefer to lease and reflected in part an increase in placements acquired under usage-based arrangements. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Q4 system average selling prices were $1.43 million as compared to $1.45 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by FX, partially offset by a favorable regional mix and a higher mix of Xi jewel placements. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $26 million in Q4 of 2021. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,820 compared with approximately $1,800 last quarter and $1,940 last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $50 and customer ordering patterns had a negative impact of approximately $40 per procedure as customers, particularly in the US and China, reduced their inventory levels. Turning to our Ion platform. In 2022, we tripled procedures to just over 23,000 and double system placements to 192 as compared to 2021. In Q4, we placed 67 Ion systems as compared to 31 in Q4 of 2021. The installed base of Ion systems is now 321 systems, of which 132 are under operating lease arrangements. Fourth quarter Ion procedures of approximately 7,900 increased 169% as compared to last year. Leveraging previous investments we have made in our da Vinci ecosystem, during the quarter, we commenced the launch of My Intuitive app for Ion users, providing them real-time access and insights to their Ion usage statistics. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 68.2% compared with 70.1% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 69.8% last quarter. As a reminder, last quarter's gross margin included a one-time benefit of approximately 50 basis points relating to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to increased fixed costs relative to revenue, the stronger US dollar and higher component pricing. The supply chain environment was challenging in Q4 and indicators of supply and inventory health did not improve as compared to last quarter. Higher fixed costs relative to revenue reflect a combination of manufacturing related inefficiencies given the environment and investments for future growth. Fourth quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 19% compared with last year, driven by increased headcount, higher travel costs, increased customer training activities and higher R&D related project costs. Fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses included a $30 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation, which can support their efforts for the next couple of years and did not repeat in 2022. The pace at which we are increasing headcount continued to moderate in Q4 with net additions of about 330 employees in the quarter compared to a net increase of approximately 530 employees last quarter. More than half of the employees we added in Q4 were production staff in our instrument factory in Mexico to support procedure growth. While we are slowing our hiring pace and pursuing leverage in our enabling functions, we are planning for balanced growth in operating expenses in 2023 given the opportunity to advance our next-generation robotics capabilities and the relatively earlier stage of our investments in Ion, SP and digital. In 2023, we expect a significant increase in expenses related to clinical trials. Brian will provide our outlook for operating expenses later in this call. As we look forward to our growth plans over the next several years, we are planning to make significant capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2022 were $532 million, and we expect 2023 capital expenditures in a range of $800 million to $1 billion, of which approximately two-thirds will be for facilities to expand our manufacturing capacity. Our manufacturing investment plans include advanced proprietary facilities for production of new products and the Ion platform in California and da Vinci systems in Georgia. Internationally, we are increasing our product development capacity in Germany, building a new low-cost endoscope manufacturing facility in Bulgaria and establishing manufacturing capacity for domestic Xi production in China. We will also be expanding the footprint of our high-volume, low-cost instrument site in Mexico to support procedure growth across all of our platforms. These investments allow us to consolidate our manufacturing into larger centralized hubs, such as our headquarter campus in Sunnyvale, California and our East Coast hub just outside of Atlanta, while we will co-locate surgeon training, technology development and manufacturing capacity. These are multiyear investments. And as a result, we expect depreciation expense to increase in 2023 and increase more significantly in 2024. Pro forma other income was $21.8 million for Q4, higher than $7.2 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses from remeasurement of the balance sheet and higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.2%, lower than prior quarters, primarily as a result of a more favorable geographical earnings mix and a discrete tax benefit of $7 million associated with the foreign tax matter. Fourth quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $439 million, or $1.23 per share compared with $473 million or $1.29 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $325 million or $0.91 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with GAAP net income of $381 million or $1.04 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the year with cash and investments of $6.7 billion compared with $7.4 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases of $1 billion and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our outlook for 2023.
Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Overall procedure growth for the full year 2022 was 18% and increased 15% on a three-year compound annual growth basis. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 16% growth in the US and 22% growth outside of the US. In the US, fourth quarter 2022 procedures grew 18% year-over-year, compared to 16% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 18% last quarter. The US procedure growth rate reflected a favorable comparison to the quarter a year ago, given the impact of the Omicron variant in December of last year. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, US procedure growth was 13%. Outside of the US, fourth quarter procedure volume grew approximately 18% year-over-year, compared to 28% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 24% last quarter. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 19%. Turning to Europe. Procedure growth in the quarter was led by strong growth in UK, Germany and Italy. In the regions noted, procedure growth outside of urology was strong in general surgery and gynecology categories. Specifically in the UK, we experienced strong early-stage growth in colorectal surgery and continued strong growth in hysterectomy. Turning to Asia. Growth outside of China continued to be solid, with notable strength in capital and procedure growth in Japan. Procedure growth in Korea was healthy and India and Taiwan continue to experience strong early-stage growth. In Japan, as Jamie noted earlier, 51 systems were placed in the country, the most in a single quarter. Overall procedure growth in Japan for the quarter was led by general surgery, with strong early stage growth in colon resection and hysterectomy and also in urology with newly reimbursed nephrectomy procedures. In China, midway through the fourth quarter, we observed the decline in procedures. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw a significant decline in procedure volume as hospitals were dealing with increase in COVID cases once the Zero-COVID policy was removed. As a result, China procedures experienced a modest year-over-year decline in Q4. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. While still in the early stages of adoption in the US, robotic-assisted bariatric surgery has been one of the fastest-growing procedures in general surgery for Intuitive. In October 2022, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders released major updates to the 1991 National Institute of Health guidelines that recommended lowering the BMI for metabolic and bariatric surgery, or MBS, from 40 to 35, regardless of the presence, absence or severity of comorbidities. These guidelines note that, 'MBS is now preferably performed using minimally invasive surgical approaches, laparoscopical robotic'. And that 'MBS is the most effective evidence-based treatment for obesity across all BMI classes.' In another bariatric analysis, Dr. Wayne Barley from St. Luke's University Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, recently published a descriptive analysis from the NBA SIP database identifying the proportion of MBS procedures in the US performed between 2015 and 2020. Using a robotic or laparoscopic approach and found up to a threefold difference in the proportion of various robotic-assisted MBS cases per year. We believe our investments in advanced instruments and surgeon training are helping to drive adoption of robotic-assisted surgery in bariatrics. We look forward to continuing to support surgeons and their care teams as they provide high-quality robotic minimally invasive care for an even greater portion of the population under the new guidelines. A recent rectal cancer study by Dr. Fang from Fudan University in Shanghai and on behalf of the RealStudy Group, published short-term outcomes from a multicenter randomized controlled trial in the Lancet. This study impaired robotic-assisted and laparoscopic approaches performed by experienced surgeons for middle and low rectal cancer across 11 hospitals in China, with approximately 580 cases included in each approach. With respect to very operative outcomes, the rate of patients with a positive circumferential margin was 3.2% lower in the robotic-assisted group as well as a 3.6% higher rate of complete macroscopic resection. Furthermore, patient laparoscopic arm experienced a 2.2% higher rate of conversion to open. A 3.3% higher rate of intraoperative complications was also reported in the laparoscopic group. Notably, 5.8% less abdominal perineal resections were performed in the robotic group. Postoperatively, patients in the robotic-assisted arm also had a faster gastrointestinal recovery postoperatively as well as a one-day shorter length of stay an approximately 7% lower rate of postoperative complications with the Clavien-Dindo of 2 or higher. In summary, the authors concluded that short-term outcomes suggests that for middle and low rectal cancer, Robotic surgery by experienced surgeons resulted in better quality resection than conventional laparoscopic surgery with less surgical trauma and better postoperative recovery. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. For 2023, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 12% to 16%. The low end of the range assumes continued choppiness with COVID hospitalizations and staffing pressure at hospitals globally throughout the year. In addition, it assumes ongoing staffing, significant challenges with COVID in China and uncertainty with the timing of the new capital quota. At the high end of the range, we assume no new significant impact from COVID throughout 2023, and assume continued growth in general surgery in the US and diversified growth beyond urology outside of the US. The range does not reflect significant material, supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we experienced at the start of the pandemic. Beyond the uncertainty with COVID in China, we expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2023 as we have experienced before the pandemic, with the first quarter being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. With respect to revenue, as we have mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure demand, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including national health care policies, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2022 pro forma gross profit margin was 69.2%. In 2023, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69% of net revenue. The lower estimate of pro forma gross profit margin in 2023 reflects the impact of higher infrastructure investment costs, higher supply chain costs, and a greater mix of new products, in particular, from our Ion platform. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix, procedure mix and volumes, fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the potential impact of competitive pricing. Turning to operating expenses. In 2022, our pro forma operating expenses grew 23%. In 2023, we expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 9% and 13%. The operating expense growth reflects investments to advance our platform capabilities, digital products, along with continued expansion into markets outside of the US and spending to support regulatory clearances and clinical trials. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $610 million to $640 million in 2023. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $140 million and $160 million in 2023. With regard to income tax, in 2022, our pro forma income tax rate was 21.8%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Robbie Marcus, representing JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Robbie Marcus: Great. Appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start, the OpEx guide came in a lot better than expected, but balance that with taking it longer to get through the regulatory cycles and bring to market with a new robot. So maybe you could talk about what exactly is taking longer? Are there certain trials that maybe had to be done in the past that are now being required? And is this global regulatory lengthening of time, or are there specific markets that are taking longer to come with a new robot?
Gary Guthart: All right. Thanks, Robbie. I think, we've been sharing with you over several quarters now. In terms of new technologies and new indications, we've seen in many of the core markets, not every single one, but many of them, additional data requirements. That changed probably four years ago, but has been playing all the way through. So it's not so much that the environment has changed over that period, just the implications of that. And you see that in things like SP, our SP trials, five or six years ago would have come to market differently and they're requiring some prospective human clinical work. That's not unique to SP. It really has to do with what the underlying technologies are and what new indications might be. So I think that is playing through relative to prior iterations of systems and features. That's true. Certainly in the United States, we've seen with the European regulatory changes over the years, increased data requirements in Europe and then it kind of varies by country from there. In terms of OpEx, perhaps I'll let you ask a follow-up question for Jamie on that one.
Robbie Marcus: Yes. And Jamie, maybe to follow up on the OpEx and I'll tie in CapEx here, because there is a good investment there for the future. Maybe talk to where you're seeing the decrease in OpEx, SG&A versus R&D? And where the lower spending growth rate year-over-year is coming from? Thanks.
Jamie Samath: Yes. It's fair, Robbie, that we're investing differentially across the areas of investment and the functions within the company. Our priorities for 2023 with respect to operating expenses to drive growth in the areas of focus, and we're being focused there. We're looking to execute some opportunities to expand markets by gaining additional clinical indications and geographical clearances. And obviously, we want to advance our technology. Within SG&A, what you see in subsets of the G&A functions is us looking to pursue leverage as we've described. And generally, from an R&D perspective, there are some investments that, as Gary has previously referenced were sequencing, and that's partly motivated by the way in which headcount has expanded over, let's say, the last year or two, and we've moderated our headcount growth as described, and that gives us the opportunity to absorb some of that headcount. So there's differential investment within SG&A and R&D. If I look at R&D and SG&A kind of in aggregate, they're likely to grow at relatively similar rates next year.
Robbie Marcus: Great. I appreciate you taking the questions.
Operator: Then we'll go to the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One, on your -- Gary, your new system comments and one on the industrial scale comments that you made today at JPMorgan. So you talked about core technology changes often requiring the clinical trials and that you won't launch a multi-port system in 2023. So Gary, my question is A, will you start a clinical trial and a new system in 2023; and B, if you did start a clinical trial, would you disclose that publicly even if the trial were outside the US, say, in a developing market?
Gary Guthart: Across our systems, we are doing trials in all sorts of places for all sorts of reasons, whether it's SPI or otherwise. And -- so the answer there is we have some places where those are publicly disclosed per normal rules. For competitive reasons, we don't try to detail them too much, and that's the position we'll take going forward.
Larry Biegelsen: Good. Fair enough. And Gary, you talked a lot about -- you used the term industrial scale a lot recently. What does that mean exactly? And what are the implications for Intuitive financially? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: I'll take what does it mean and I'll ask Jamie to help me on detailing on the finance side. One of the things that's going on is that we are becoming well integrated into many surgical practices in several countries. I think that's a great opportunity for us and a serious responsibility. As we've seen in the last couple of years with regard to supply chain robustness and other things, making sure that -- we have supply chain stability that we want vertically integrating where we can. We have been doing that. A lot of the imaging pipeline work that we've done. We think that both gives us higher quality. It allows us to lower cost to the customer and it gives us robustness. We can plan for that robustness. That's true not only in imaging, but in some core technologies and instruments and accessories. And we think those are good long-term investments. So, that's been really positive. There's another place where our digital tools and our digital products, one of the things that's going on that I think is powerful for the company is not just product architecture, but business architecture. And what I mean by that is that our supply chain can support multiple platforms in multiple countries around the world. It can -- by that, I mean, multiport, single-port and Ion, our digital products architecture also is seamless and can integrate and support those platforms. So, that gives us a great quality advantage, it gives us a leverage capability, and allows us to lower the total cost for our customers and the cost to serve for our customers. Those things take some planning and some forward investment and it can be in core technology. For example, in digital, it can be in facilities, in manufacturing base, so we can build our products. But it's that opportunity. It's a global opportunity to help support the standard of care in multiple countries. I think that the customer advantages are quite clear and I think the cost robustness and long-term durability advantages for the company are quite clear. But that takes some play out over time. Jamie, any help you'll give?
Jamie Samath: I would just say industrial operating -- industrial scale is linked to the capital expenditure plans that we've described, the $800 million to $1 billion of investment in 2023. I'd just add the financial ROI calculations on those investments are relatively straightforward. And we think there are real advantages in having large, highly automated factories that run at scale and that's an advantage both for us and for our customers. So, the return calculations are relatively straightforward and they're essentially the incremental gross margin dollars we can drive from growth.
Larry Biegelsen: All right. Thank you very much.
Gary Guthart: Thanks Larry.
Operator: Next we'll go to line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Travis Steed: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just curious, Gary, I mean, you mentioned no new multi-port platform in 2023, but curious how you're thinking about upgrades to Gen 4, but that's mostly just around the software upgrades you mentioned, or if we could see something more material with capability upgrades on hardware, imaging or things that bring the customer procedure down?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. We continue to add capabilities into Gen 4. We expect to do so this year as well. Some of it will be in advanced instrumentation. We are doing some nice work in our energy systems on the -- both on the hardware side and some of the software side, and we think there's some capability improvements that we're going to be developing over time around core imaging capability in Gen 4. So we continue to make progress.
Travis Steed: Okay. But not saying if anything to come to 2023 or not on that front? And then while I have you, just any early comments on the capital funnel in 2023. I think last year, kind of, January, February time frame is when customers are evaluating budget. So I just want to make sure things seem fairly stable with the capital funnel?
Jamie Samath: On the capital funnel side, what I'd say is, given the macro inputs from customers are our sense is that they are still relatively cautious. I think there's quite a bit of uncertainty still in the macro. And while, for example, staffing shortages have improved, they're still quite a bit worse than pre-pandemic levels in terms of labor costs, vacancy rates for hospitals. So they are being careful from a financial perspective and they're cautious given macroeconomic uncertainty. I think our experiences in the second half of 2022 has been where customers are seeing nice growth in their robotics programs. da Vinci stays as a relatively high priority in terms of their capital budgets. But beyond the fact that they're cautious, I wouldn't say there's anything specific I'd highlight in terms of 2023 outlook.
Travis Steed: All right, great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Good afternoon. Hi, Gary. Starting off maybe with the new system, thank you for being so clear about your thoughts about the timing of a new system, i.e., not in 2023. But at a high level, could you talk to us about your thinking about why or why not? I mean, I know obviously, you've -- you're always -- the company -- for your entire history, you're always thinking about what's next and getting ready for it. But how are you -- is it the technology that you wanted to have isn't ready yet, or this is more about competitive positioning or the difficult external environment on capital makes you hesitant to go ahead this year. Just trying to understand your thinking about it and what that might say about the future?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Thank you for the question. We think mostly about what can we do that changes the experience of surgery for the patient in terms of outcomes and the care teams in terms of how they deliver that set of outcomes. And what we can do in terms of technology basis, products and services and training that can help that happen. That is the primary thing. That's the thing that is front and center. And we do design studies, research, usability effort, all the things you would expect for us to make progress. And then we try to advance that as quickly as reasonably we can, given the environment that we're in. We don't do too much perfection of timing about what we think the hospital capital environment is going to be. We don't -- you can imagine somebody doing that, that is not my highest motivation. I think these things are sophisticated enough and complex enough to bring to market, that trying to time it perfectly with regard to the macroeconomic environment is not what we're really driven by. We work closely with our technologists who are, I think, spectacular. We work closely with regulatory bodies around the world to understand what their needs and requirements are. And of course, we work very closely with key customers to understand whether the things we think matter, matter. And those are the things that we really do and once we find a pathway, then we work down that pathway. I have to say that supply chain disruptions that have happened in the last three years have impacted not only production capability, but impact new product development as well, because that puts waves and ripples into what kind of items people can procure for prototypes and other forms of focus. So there's a little bit of that in there, too.
Rick Wise: Thank you. And just as a follow-up, just if you could expand further on your China comments, particularly related to new tender quota expectations. And I just want to make sure I'm understanding carefully or we're all understanding your thoughts or your embedded thoughts about procedure recovery as flow as the year unfolds? Thank you, very much.
Jamie Samath: Yes. I think what we're saying is, we saw China procedures impacted in November. That got more severe in December, has continued so far in the early part of January, and we expect, therefore, procedures in China to be at least impacted in Q1 and perhaps beyond. And I think it's difficult for us to predict, given the relatively unique situation China is in relative to the Zero-COVID policy that they have had. So we're not making any specific predictions as to when and how that might recover. Brian laid out how that's reflected in the procedure guidance that we provided. Separately, on the quota, we're in the third year again of kind of new quota period, the last two quotas have been issued in the third year. We only use that as a historical reference, nothing more. We don't have any particular insight as to when a new quota might come.
Rick Wise: Thank you, Jamie.
Operator: And our next question will be from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please, go ahead.
Matt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one on China. You talked about the uncertainty with refreshing the quota and then some new local competitors that are competing for tenders. I wondered if you could kind of flesh that out a little bit and talk about any insight you have into when and how much the quota could be? And then, could you give us a flavor for how competitive you think the local competitors will be to compete for the tenders in China and beyond?
Jamie Samath: I would just say that, underlying demand for robotic technology in China, if you take a mid- and long-term view, is quite strong. And our experience so far has been that surgeons care about the capability and feature set of the products that they use there. Again, we don't have any particular insight with respect to timing and size of quota. We saw the last quota we received was higher than the previous one, but we have no ability to predict that it will be larger again. So we'd love to be able to give you greater clarity than that. But what's the second part of your question, Matt?
Gary Guthart: Why don't I take that one? That was a little bit about local competition and what kinds of things we're seeing. First, I think the entry of competitors in China is natural and should be expected. I think in some ways, it's probably a net positive in terms of how people think about the quota. That's more people advocating for the value of this in the market, it's probably a net positive over time, therefore, for market development also. In the near-term, early markets, we've seen this everywhere around the world with new systems entering. The very early entry is different than the middle is different than the late. And the early, there tend to be a lot of placements, a lot of things around clinical trials, a lot of things around setting up early capacity that are, in some sense, not indicative of value-based or feature-based competition, and we're going to see some of that early on. And then after that wave goes through putting your clinical trial systems out, then it starts to settle down, and you see a little bit more of what the core competitive dynamics look like. So, we're really, really in the early innings with what we're seeing in China competitors. I expect them to be active and assertive.
Matt Taylor: Okay, clear. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Next we'll go to line of Anthony Petrone, representing the Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks. One, on overall pricing as it relates to just the update here on the multiport system and then a follow-up on procedure volumes, specifically in the US. On pricing, just trying to understand the dynamics here. We have higher input costs as it relates to R&D, there's inflation, and there's a heavy CapEx cycle. So, you can sort of, on the one hand, push that through the higher pricing for NextGen robot. But on the other side, we have, obviously, hospitals somewhat constrained here and Intuitive now has a licensing model. So, when we think about an elongated regulatory cycle, how does that influence the pricing strategy on the next-gen robot? And then just quickly on procedures, the lower BMI threshold, the new guideline, 40 to 35, it seems like a big deal. Is that contemplated in the 12% to 16% procedure guidance? Thanks.
Jamie Samath: Just with respect to pricing, I'll only comment on current products in the portfolio, as you described. What we're seeing is core costs in our supply chain, the prices we pay our suppliers, the wage costs we pay our production staff. They have gone up, and that looks sticky. We have a routine process we use to monitor pricing on an ongoing basis. We'll continue that process. There's nothing that we would highlight at this point with respect to any specific decisions that we've made relative to pricing, but it's something that we're monitoring carefully through the existing processes that we have. With respect to your question on bariatrics and the change in BMI guidelines, I think it's really early to determine what effect, if anything, that might have in terms of the total surgical term for bariatrics. And so therefore, there's nothing reflected in the 12% to 16% guidance that we provided, and I wouldn't expect it to move that quickly. And there are -- by the way, in bariatrics, there are kind of real protocols patients have to go through with respect to a set of activities that they undertake before they become eligible for surgery, even with this change in guidelines.
Gary Guthart: Maybe I'd add a tiny bit on pricing and margin. On the pricing side, we look all the way across the total cost of ownership for our customers and make sure that's matched to value. So what's the value we bring and then what is the pricing that does that. We do that, as Jamie said, routinely, and we do it by country. It's a global look. With regard to some of the pressures on margin, whether they're inflationary or what have you, Jamie's point, some of those are sticky. We understand the levers that we have, whether it's in design or scale or production or other opportunities. And we're in pursuit of those. I don't think we're confused about where to go from here. Some of them take a little while. So some of the investments we're making, some of the automation that we talked about, some of the factory automation we’re talking about those are things that give us better control of cost over time. And so I don't think we're confused or really caught off guard by some of the changes of the cost influence.
Anthony Petrone: Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from the line of Shagun Singh with RBC. Please go ahead.
Shagun Singh: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Just a clarification and then one on Ion. On the new system, you said not 2023, but could we expect something in 2024, or if you have to initiate a clinical trial and depending on the size of fed et cetera, are we looking at a launch beyond the 2024 time line? Just any preliminary color would be helpful. And then you did talk about the lowering the total cost to treat, as well as expansion in different kinds of procedures. Any color beyond what you provided on the call on what, kind of, advancements or any look into what could allow you to achieve that in the new system? And then on Ion, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the expected impact of the full set of the PRECIsE two-year results. And also any progress that you're making on indication expansion and the ablation technology? Thank you for taking the questions.
Gary Guthart: Okay. Nothing further to detail on multi-port beyond what we've discussed already. With regard to opportunities for our platforms period, we have opportunities across our set. We'll -- I talked to you a little bit about what we're doing in SP already. We'll detail that more as it unfolds in 2023 as to where we see opportunity for SP to create indication expansions and to open new procedure markets for us, which we're excited about. On the Ion front, you asked a little bit about the PRECIsE tier data. I don't have anything more to detail on that. Feedback from the field we have outside of that specific study has been that it's delivering on the promise. Folks are finding that it's usable that it is supplying the outcome that they had hoped and we're seeing that reflected in the adoption. So we're pleased with that. With regard to ablation, we are -- as we said last quarter, we're just at the early innings of engaging customers in Europe and looking at the trial data. We're excited by it. I think there are several indications in the long that we'll pursue over time. We'll detail those more as we get more experience and more time. There are opportunities outside the long too, I want to be clear. We think those are interesting, but they're not areas of current focus. We really think finish the job we started. We have great engagement with pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons. We have opportunity to continue to support them to make our products ever easier, more robust and to move the margin structure where we want it to go. We're going to focus on that. And then we'll move to other indications in the lung. And then from after that, we'll have earned our opportunity to do the next step.
Gary Guthart: So thank you for the questions there. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and, ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Event Services. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-18 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Third Quarter Earnings Release Call. At this time, all participants are in a later -- listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Brian King. Please go ahead.
Brian King: Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive’s third quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call maybe deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2022 and Form 10-Q filed on July 22, 2022. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC’s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today’s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2022, and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our business fundamentals strengthened in Q3 with 20% procedure growth in da Vinci procedures compared with Q3 of last year and solid performance in each of our global regions. Our capital placements reflected 13% growth in our installed base to meet procedure demand accompanied by continued increases in utilization per system per year, healthy indicators for our customers and for us. Ion also experienced increases in installs, procedures performed and annualized system utilization. Supply chain challenges while still present are abating from their pandemic peaks. Looking more closely at procedures, 20% growth is up from 14% last quarter and above our three-year compound annual growth rate of 16% during the pandemic. General surgery, our largest procedure category, is growing at the fastest rate of any category fueled by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy, hernia repair and other foregut procedures in the United States. In Europe, several countries are growing nicely with diversified use beyond urology. Germany, the UK and Ireland, Italy and Spain stood out in the quarter. In Asia, Japanese procedure growth accelerated relative to Q2 and Korean growth remained solid. Procedures in both countries are also diversifying beyond urology. In China, procedure growth was just above our global average, hampered in part by regional rolling lockdowns that continue to impact procedures and utilization. Turning to capital, we placed 305 systems in the quarter compared with 336 in Q3 a year ago and 279 last quarter. Strong procedure demand is supporting da Vinci installed base growth of 13% in the quarter. Per system utilization grew 7% in the quarter, up from our three-year compound annual growth of 5% over the pandemic. Utilization was aided by recovery from a softer U.S. procedure quarter last year, as well as customer performance of more types of procedures and higher volume categories and increases in customer efficiency. SI trade-ins continued to slow given the decline in remaining trade-in opportunity. Ion placements grew to 50 this quarter, up from 28 last year and 41 last quarter, reflecting continued growth in an early market. Overall, our customers are acquiring systems where there is opportunity for procedure growth. On the investment front, we continue to focus on our platforms in multiport endoluminal, single port and digital through indication and regional regulatory expansions, innovation in products and services that meet customer needs and product quality and cost refinements. We expect our new platforms to approach our historical levels of contribution margin over time, progress year-to-date has met our expectations. With regard to our expenses this quarter, we moderated headcount growth to focus on deeply integrating those employees who joined us in the past several quarters. Going into 2023, we expect the rate of growth in fixed expenses to slow as we pursue leverage in our enabling functions and sequence some of our forward investments. We have had a solid quarter achieving product and services milestones. We continue to expand access to our multiport products, training and services globally. Standouts in the quarter include record global quarterly new surgeon training completions to first case and accreditation of our technology training pathway by the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK. For Ion, we submitted our registration application in China, and we obtained German regulatory clinical study approval for ion ablation technology, which start -- which starts our clinical journey towards enabling interventions beyond biopsy. Ion procedures grew 211% in the quarter. Turning to our single-port platform, da Vinci SP, procedures grew 46% year-over-year, with particular strength in Korea, where our SP team launched next-generation SP instruments and our Firefly-enabled endoscope. We also received PMDA clearance in the quarter, market SP in Japan across a broad set of clinical indications similar to the indications SP has in Korea. In our digital portfolio, our My Intuitive app and PORTaL are being adopted broadly in regions in which they are released as the go-to digital portal for da Vinci customers. Installs of our in-room computing platform, Intuitive Hub grew 21% over the third quarter last year and software updates to our Hub installed base improved usability and enabled telepresence. In summary, our core business strengthened in the quarter as acute pandemic impact softened. We are managing spend growth, while investing in core growth opportunities for the future. I will now pass the time over to Jamie to take us through our finances and some persistent macroeconomic issues in greater detail.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. In Q3, growth in procedures, the installed base of da Vinci systems and average system utilization was healthy. The strength of these key business drivers resulted in a pro forma operating margin of 36% and pro forma EPS of $1.19. Simultaneously, we saw headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar, lingering supply chain issues and inflation, which together negatively impacted pro forma operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points compared to the third quarter of last year. I will take you through these details. Q3 procedure growth of 20% reflected an increase in U.S. procedures of 18% and OUS procedure growth of 24%. U.S. procedure growth reflected a favorable comparison to the year ago quarter given the impact of the Delta variant last year. On a three-year compound annual growth rate basis, U.S. procedures grew approximately 13%. In China, our second largest market during the quarter procedures continued to recover from the impact of COVID-related lockdowns that we described on last quarter’s earnings call. However, we continue to see regional lockdowns occur as COVID cases rise. Turning to capital, we placed 305 systems in the third quarter, 9% lower than the 336 systems we placed last year. Third quarter system placements included approximately 15 systems that were delayed at the end of last quarter due to component supply delays. There were 71 trading transactions in the quarter, as compared to 136 in Q3 of 2021, reflecting the decline in the number of SIs remaining in the installed base. As of the end of Q3, there were approximately 739 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 191 are in the U.S. Excluding trade-in transactions global system placements grew 17% from last year. The installed base of da Vinci systems grew approximately 13% year-over-year, consistent with recent trends. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased almost 7% compared to last year. Using a three-year compound annual growth rate, third quarter utilization was consistent with historical averages, increasing almost 5%. Average system utilization in the U.S. grew 6% year-over-year, an improvement from the 1% decline in utilization in Q2. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q3 revenue was $1.56 billion, an increase of 11% from the third quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue grew approximately 15%. In the third quarter, revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represented 22% of total revenue. On a revenue weighted basis, using current exchange rates, net of hedges in place for Q4, the U.S. dollar is approximately 3% stronger than the rates realized in Q3. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows, in the U.S., we placed 175 systems in the third quarter, lower than the 227 in Q3 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 66 systems associated with trade-in transactions and a challenging macroeconomic environment. Outside the U.S., we placed 130 systems in the third quarter, compared with 109 last year. Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 14 into China, compared with 47 into Europe, 20 into Japan and 17 into China in the third quarter of 2021. As of the end of Q3 2022, there were 40 systems remaining under the current quota in China, which is also available to the three domestic competitors that have completed local registration with NMPA. Markets that are served through distributors have represented approximately 10% of system placements so far this year. Our distribution partners purchased product from us in U.S. dollars and sell in their local currencies. While we have not experienced a significant impact so far, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduces distributor margins and may cause delays in capital purchases. Leasing represented 37% of Q3 placements, compared with 42% last quarter and 41% in the third quarter of 2021. The lower lease mix is a function of customer and regional mix, and while leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Third quarter system average selling prices were $1.5 million consistent with last quarter. System ASPs were negatively impacted by a higher trade-in mix and the impact of FX, offset by a higher mix of Xi dual console placements. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter, compared with $22 million last quarter and $25 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800, compared with approximately $1,900 for both last quarter and last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $50. The remainder of the year-over-year reduction was primarily a result of customer ordering patterns. During the quarter, our distributors and customers in certain OUS markets reduced their inventory as supply chain predictability moderately improved. We placed 50 Ion systems in the quarter, as compared to 28 in the third quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 254 systems, of which 112 are under operating lease arrangements. Third quarter Ion procedures of approximately 6,400 increased 211% on a year-over-year basis. Ion is in the new MDR regulatory review process in Europe, and during the quarter, we submitted Ion into the regulatory process in China. As a reminder, regulatory review timelines in China are lengthy. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2022 was 69.8%, compared with 71.3% for the third quarter of 2021 and 69.2% last quarter. Q3 pro forma gross margin included a one-time benefit of approximately 50 basis points relating to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar, manufacturing and logistics inefficiencies as a result of the supply chain environment, higher component pricing and increased fixed costs relative to revenue. Indicators of supply and inventory held modestly improved in the quarter but remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Pro forma operating expenses increased 24% compared with third quarter of 2021, driven by increased headcount, higher R&D related project costs and higher travel costs. Growth in operating expenses has been primarily in support of our Ion platform, next-generation robotics capabilities, our digital capabilities and expansion of our infrastructure to allow us to effectively scale. We are also seeing higher regulatory costs as a result of increased regulatory requirements globally and expansion of our new platforms into OUS markets. As Gary mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we slowed our hiring pace, adding approximately 530 employees lower than the 700-plus employees we have added per quarter in the last three quarters. As we look forward to 2023, we expect our operating expense growth will be lower than the growth for this year. The slowing growth rate of operating expenses reflects the completion of some of our infrastructure and business process improvement investments and planned leverage in our enabling functions. As part of our planning process, we are also conducting a review of our capital expenditure priorities and we will provide an update as to the outcome of this review on the next call. Within this framework, we will continue to invest in our new platforms, Ion and SP, next-generation capabilities and our digital ecosystem, given the return profiles we see for those investments. Pro forma other income was $7.2 million for Q3, lower than $10.4 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange losses from re-measurement of the balance sheet resulting from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.4%, in line with our expectations. Third quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $429 million or $1.19 per share, compared with $435 million and also $1.19 per share for the third quarter of last year. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $153 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $324 million or $0.90 per share for the third quarter of 2022, compared with GAAP net income of $381 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.4 billion, compared with $8.2 billion at the end of Q2. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. During the quarter, we completed a $1 billion ASR in addition to the $607 million of shares repurchased in the first half. Since the end of 2021, our diluted share count has decreased by approximately 7 million shares or 2% and we have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $2.5 billion. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022.
Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Our overall third quarter 2022 procedure growth was 20%, compared to 20% for the third quarter of 2021 and 14% last quarter. The three-year compound annual growth rate between the third quarter of 2019 and third quarter of 2022 was 16%. In the U.S., third quarter 2022 procedures exceeded our expectations with growth at 18% year-over-year, compared to 16% for the third quarter of 2021 and 11% last quarter. Procedure growth reflects a positive impact relative to Q3 last year, which was impacted by the Delta variant. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, U.S. procedure growth was 13%. Third quarter procedure growth continued to be driven by general surgery with strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Trends in malignant procedures, namely colorectal and lobectomy procedures were also strong. Growth in gynecology, our second largest procedure category in the U.S., also experienced double-digit growth, while more mature urologic procedures grew in the high single digits. Outside of the U.S., third quarter procedure volume grew approximately 24% year-over-year, compared to 30% for the third quarter of 2021 and 22% last quarter. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 21%. Turning to Europe, procedure growth was led by strong growth in Germany, U.K., Italy and Spain. In all of the regions noted, procedure growth outside of urology was strong in general surgery and gynecology categories. Specifically in Germany, we experienced early-stage growth in benign hysterectomy and colorectal surgery. In the U.K., growth was led by benign hysterectomy, colorectal and cholecystectomy procedures. While still early-stage, year-over-year procedure growth in these non-urology procedures was almost 4 times higher than urology. Turning to Asia, in Japan, growth in general surgery and gynecology continued to be strong. We experienced robust growth in these categories led by gastrectomy, rectal resection and benign hysterectomy. Further contributing to strong procedure performance was continued early-stage growth in newly reimbursed procedures, namely colon resection and nephrectomy procedures. In China, we continue to see a recovery in the first couple of months of the third quarter as COVID cases began to decline and lockdown restrictions were lifted. Procedure growth was driven by urologic procedures, specifically prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy, along with strong growth in colon resection within general surgery. Later in the quarter, we began to see procedures start to moderate as COVID began to reemerge in various regions and rolling lockdowns were implemented. Korea procedure growth was also solid in the third quarter. Growth in procedures continued to be broad-based with strong growth in SP procedures. Now turning to the clinical side of our business, each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Earlier today at the Annual CHEST conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Dr. Eric Folk from Massachusetts General Hospital presented preliminary performance updates from the PRECIsE study. Results were consistent with data released last year and demonstrated encouraging results for diagnostic yield and sensitivity of malignancy for samples obtained through an Ion procedure with a strong safety profile. We anticipate the final data from PRECIsE to be published in the first part of next year. Continuing with Ion, a group from the Mayo Clinic in both Rochester, Minnesota and Jacksonville, Florida, led by doctors Alejandra Yu Lee-Mateus, Janani Reisenauer and Sebastian Fernandez-Bussy published a retrospective case series in respirology, comparing the performance of the Ion endoluminal system with the CT guided transthoracic approach for pulmonary lesion biopsy. A total of 225 patients were included in this study. 113 who underwent an Ion procedure with a median nodule size of 18 millimeters and 112 who underwent a transthoracic biopsy with a median nodule size of 16 millimeters. Within the Ion group, the overall diagnostic yield and sensitivity for malignancy reported was 87.6% and 82.1%, respectively, which were comparable to the same outcomes from the transthoracic approach. Importantly, the rate of complications was significantly lower for the Ion approach, with a 13% difference relative to the transthoracic approach. Further analysis demonstrated an approximately 80% reduced chance of pneumothorax associated with the Ion procedure. The authors concluded in part that robotic assisted approach with Ion can be as accurate as the transthoracic approach for sampling pulmonary nodules with similar or reduced complications and should be considered as a means for nodule biopsy. Turning to the surgical side, Dr. Leonardo Sandrolini from the University of Bologna and colleagues published a systematic review and meta analysis comparing the robotic-assisted and laparoscopic approaches for left colectomy procedures in the International Journal of Colorectal Disease. Data from 11 different articles, including over 52,000 patients were included in this analysis, with over 13,500 in the robotic arm and over 39,000 in the laparoscopic arm and with no difference in preoperative characteristics reported. With regard to perioperative outcomes, a 4% lower conversion to open rate was reported for the robotic-assisted approach compared to the laparoscopic approach. Further analysis demonstrated the risk of conversion to open for the robotic-assisted approach was approximately half the rest of the laparoscopic approach. In addition, the analysis showed a higher risk of postoperative complications after a laparoscopic left colectomy, as well as a lower rate of superficial wound infections for the robotic-assisted approach. The analysis also showed anastomotic leak was 30% less likely with the robotic-assisted approach compared to the lap group. The authors concluded in part that robotic left colectomy requires less conversion to open surgery than the standard laparoscopic approach and more studies are warranted to highlight possible advantages in using the robotic platform for left colectomy. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022. Starting with procedures, on our last call, we forecast full year 2022 procedure growth within a range of 14% to 16.5%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2022 procedure growth of 17% to 18%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of the range still assumes increasing COVID hospitalizations, regional lockdowns and staffing pressure at hospitals for the remainder of the year. At the high end of the range, we assume COVID-19-related hospitalizations around the world continue to decline throughout the remainder of 2022, and there are no additional significant impacts from further resurgences. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we have experienced at the start of the pandemic. Turning to gross profit, on our last call, we forecast our 2022 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70.5%, expected to be towards the lower end of that range. We are now refining our estimate of pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 69.5% of net revenue, given the ongoing impact of higher input costs related to supply chain and the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on products, regional and trade-in mix, fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the impact of new product introductions. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 25%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 21% and 23%. We are narrowing our estimate for non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $520 million to $530 million in 2022. We are also updating our estimate for other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $40 million and $50 million in 2022, a decrease from our previous estimate of $60 million and $70 million. The decrease primarily reflects lower interest income on cash that was used to repurchase shares and also the net impact of certain foreign exchange gains and losses. On last quarter’s call, we forecast 2022 capital expenditures within a range of $700 million to $800 million. We are now lowering our estimate for capital expenditures for 2022 to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions. Maggie, I think we would like to go ahead and lead the Q&A ahead.
Operator: All right. Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first we have a question from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Travis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the good quarter. Maybe, Gary, on the capital selling funnel, just maybe you could comment how the funnel has changed since at the end of the year when you initially highlighted a slower funnel. And just trying to square away the 13% installed base growth with the slower funnel and if that’s being offset by the 7% higher utilization and how to think about capital in the double placements moving forward?
Gary Guthart: What we are seeing on that side, on the capital side is that, where we see healthy procedure growth, the installed base growth is keeping pace and you are absolutely right in your question to kind of link utilization growth with installed base growth. On the utilization side, the 7% is higher than the norm. It’s got a little artifact in it we think, which is a year ago third quarter was a little bit suppressed because of the Delta variant. So I think it’s hard to keep doing 7% quarterly. If the customers could do that, we would be delighted. It’s -- utilization is good for them, it’s good for us and it’s fine, it’s just hard to move in a durable way because of all the workflow issues in the hospital at large, not just robotics, but just across the system. So we are seeing both. I think the capital side what we have seen here is that capital is available to be competed for if you can become a high priority within the hospital to get it. So it’s not so much that the capital environment is easy as it is competitive and if you can rise on the party list, then we will find that the loop and we are seeing that in installed base growth in greenfields and in Ion.
Operator: Thank you. And next we have a question from the line of Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Thank you. And a couple of questions if that’s okay. First, I think, maybe just to ask about how you are thinking about the pipeline for more mature procedures. If I heard you right, you were urology and gynecology up high-single digits, double digits in the U.S., pretty good numbers, just want to make sure those are clean. And then just kind of the typical question about your own sources, external internal customer discussions, just how you are thinking about the diagnostic pipeline for those slower growing cancer procedures and kind of where we are or where we are heading relative to the trough levels that were observed last year?
Gary Guthart: Okay. On the issue of kind of the quality of growth on urology and gynecology, Brian, I am going to kick that to you.
Brian King: Sure. And I think Gary touched on it on the previous answer, an element of that being just a comparison period from last year, but still seeing really healthy growth in those particular categories. As I called out, growth in gynecology, which is our second largest procedure category, did have, I’d say, double-digit growth, probably in the lower end there and then those more mature urologic procedures being those high-single digits, but it’s really favoring from the comparison from last year, but still doing really well.
Jamie Samath: On the diagnostic pipelines, what we continue to see for the most part is relatively steady in terms of the tests that are occurring, mostly a little below the volumes that we saw pre-pandemic. The one exception that we have seen in the U.S. in kind of recent trends is a tick up in colonoscopies. I wouldn’t say that this evidence that that’s impacted da Vinci procedures yet as that’s a recent trend, obviously, we are encouraged by the fact that more patients are able to get back to having those diagnostic tests and we will see how that plays out in terms of surgery.
Gary Guthart: On just a follow-up point to Brian, your answer, I think, the other thing is that while we are mature in urology and gynecology in the United States, there’s still a little growth there too. But outside the United States and Europe and Asia, we are still relatively early and we think that in those two categories we will continue to see growth. Jamie, just a follow-up point on your answer on the diagnostics side, you were saying it started to come back and we are seeing a little bit of an uptick. It is absolutely clear that there’s been a trough or a bolus of people who stayed out of diagnostic pipelines and that hasn’t fully recovered. And their disease is progressing. That is also absolutely clear in the literature. So how big that is and what that looks like as they come back into the health system in terms of surgery and da Vinci surgery, you are just going to have to wait and see. It’s a hard thing to measure, but I think there’s a bolus out there and it’s unfortunate given disease progression.
Operator: Thank you. And next we have a question from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations. Just two for me, I wanted to start, Gary, with the color commentary you gave on OpEx spending next year. If we look at the last five years, you grew EPS faster than sales or pre-COVID, I am sorry, four years to the five years, this year, it looks like earnings will probably be down. How much of a priority is EPS growth and what would need to happen for you to get back to the algorithm where you grew EPS faster than sales and I have one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: The -- we watch it. We want to make sure that we are efficient stewards of our expenses and our capital and where we see an efficiency we will pursue it. That’s what I have been messaging and that’s what I was talking about here in the script. We think there are opportunities for us to increase our productivity and to do a better job onboarding from the staff we have brought in, helping them become more productive more quickly. We think there are really good opportunities in our new platforms, the things we have been talking to you about. Ion is growing nicely. SP, as we pursue additional indications. I think will be quite strong and we are pleased with multiport currently what’s in the market, the things we are working on, as well as our digital tools. So we think those things are important. We don’t want to starve them. But we will sequence them. So it’s a balanced approach. Some of it is making sure that our growth engines remain intact and we continue to innovate. Other parts are just making sure that we are being efficient with our use of capital and that we are building a lean organization as we grow. Jamie, you can speak a little bit to the expense characterization as you see it.
Jamie Samath: There’s just a couple of framing comments I’d make, Larry. If you look at the midpoint of the procedure guidance we provided, on a three-year CAGR basis, that’s procedure growth of about 15%, just under -- just over 15%. You do the same for our OpEx guidance, that’s just under 15%. So, kind of back to 2019 on a three-year CAGR basis, procedure growth and spending growth relatively in line. Just one other thing I’d highlight to make a point, if you look at the reported revenue growth for Q3 and 11% year-over-year. If you look at our recurring revenue growth, that’s about 80% of our total revenue, 16%. If you adjust that on a constant currency basis, it’s 20% revenue growth and so comparable with the 20% procedure growth. When you look back at 2018, 2019, generally, procedure growth and revenue growth are relatively similar. You are seeing a disconnect right now for the reasons we have described, the lower trade-in volumes, trade-in volumes so far this year are down 40% from the prior year and you are seeing the impact of FX as we have described. And so there are some macro and secular level impacts on what’s happening in the P&L this year. Specifically on spending, we kind of described it in the script. There are some infrastructure investments that we have been making that start to complete and that creates the opportunity for us to spend at a lower growth rate, and given the work that we have done and the investments that we have made, we are going to look for some leverage in our enabling functions, particularly as we get into next year. Final thing that Gary mentioned was as you look at kind of our pipeline, there’s some natural sequencing that you will do with respect to some of our programmatic spending next year and those factors play into the slowing operating expense growth rate that we have described.
Larry Biegelsen: That’s super helpful. If I could sneak one in -- one more in. Gary, you have talked about a huge amount of variation in surgery around the world. You have talked about developing tools to identify best practices to reduce the variation and improve outcomes. Where are you in that process and what are the capabilities you still need to develop to make that a reality? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I love that question. The -- there’s a couple of things. On the kind of the baseline, you need to gather enough of the right data to characterize variability of care teams and variability of patients. So there’s a patient population, it’s got variability and you have got care team or physician variability as well. And getting the right data streams, getting them stored and figuring out how to do the right kind of assessment or analysis on them, curating that data, making sure it’s annotated properly, some basic stuff that you have to do to be able to look for meaningful sources of variation. We are well down that pathway in terms of getting the right data streams, having the right conversations with our customers and starting to do the analysis. So I am excited by it. As we look at how to deliver that, we are still in a I think surgical science discovery phase. We are partnered with many of the top hospitals -- academic hospitals around the world looking at surgical data science, starting to figure out sources of variation and drawing it back to causality, not just correlation. So I think the baseline is there, the ability to collect and gather that data, I think our relationships with top tier researchers are in place and we are starting to see early signals that look really good. Final point I’d make is there are some basic things we can do that are logical and not extraordinarily complicated that can help personalized learning pathways and training pathways, and we are starting to work through that now. That’s kinds of technologies that will come out into the field first. So I think it was a long-term journey. Some of the things we talked to you about Intuitive Hub or some of the baseline capabilities there in terms of the right data collected, annotated the right way and shared with the right hospital customers to get us good outcomes.
Operator: Thank you. Next we have Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Robbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I will add my congratulations on a nice quarter. Maybe just to dial-in a little bit more on the capital equipment environment, you touched on this and it’s great to see procedures driving placement volumes. But are you seeing any changes, whether it’s in the U.S. or Europe as we are in an uncertain economic environment around the world, it’s clearly not showing up in the numbers yet. But just seeing if there’s any rate of change or if the outlook is any different than the current environment? Thanks a lot.
Jamie Samath: Just a couple of things I’d highlight. As we have spoken to customers and this is mostly anecdotal, you do see some input that staffing pressures are easing a little bit, particularly with respect to vacation rates and labor costs. Those two factors are still way above pre-pandemic levels, but you see a little bit of improvement in the quarter, at least based on both those anecdotes and the survey work that we have seen. In Q2 and Q3, you saw customers going through the process of reexamining their capital budgets and that causes some delays in capital investments, and obviously, they reprioritize what they invest in. I think robotic surgery is still an area of potential value for customers. That does cause some delays. On the OUS side, we haven’t seen a significant impact yet so far in terms of capital spending by those customers. Generally, we are at earlier stages of adoption. The payer structures are different and so far at least what we have seen is kind of nice capital numbers in the OUS markets, as you can see from the kind of comparisons. If you look at European placements in Q3, they were up 15%, placements in Asia were up 36% year-over-year. So we haven’t seen anything so far. I would say there are obviously economic risks, particularly in Europe with the energy situation there, the situation with Ukraine and Russia, we haven’t seen those manifest yet.
Operator: Thank you. And next we have a line -- question from the line of Richard Newitter with Truist. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. Just with respect to the spending sequencing comments that you made, what should we be thinking about that with respect to locations or kind of a next-gen console system and some of the other types of iterative technology advancements you have talked about in the pipeline. Is there any implication for a new system if you will or da Vinci next-gen console in the cadence of the spending you are talking about in 2023? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Across the platforms, we work on improvements to the robot system side or full innovation there. We work on instruments and accessories and software updates and sometimes partnered product. In general, we maintain our priority and our cadence on those things that we think are going to have the biggest impact to our customers that allow them to get better outcomes or to address new opportunities that they are not addressing today. We continue to invest and have a high priority on quality improvements and things that will make our customers more satisfied. Some other things that tend to be great ideas, but perhaps are not highly urgent, then those things will sequence out and that’s a conversation we routinely have. What do we have to do at high priority and do it at high quality quickly? What are the things that can sequence after that? So hard to answer your question in detail from a process point of view, if it matters a lot to our customers, if it’s a high dissatisfy or high opportunity, those things get put in line first.
Operator: Thank you. And next we have the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Jayson Bedford: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One topic that I thought was interesting, you mentioned ablation technology with respect to Ion and starting a trial in Germany. Can you talk a bit more about the technology and the size and scope of the trial, and maybe any type of timeline you can offer in the U.S. in terms of starting a trial?
Gary Guthart: Well, I will talk a little bit about the motivation. In terms of the details of the trial, I don’t have them at our fingertips, but our team can respond to that in a future call. Here we know that Ion can navigate in deep into the lung, we know that surgeons and interventional pulmonologists want to treat tissue there. They want to be able to engage with it one way or another. So ablative technology can be used for a couple of different disease states and we have high interest in that, whether it’s inoperable cancer or whether it’s something for emphysema or chronic bronchitis. So being able to navigate there with an energy source will ultimately be important. The first one that we are talking about here, I believe is a microwave energy source. There are some other energy sources that people are interested in. In some cases, we are developing it ourselves and in several other cases we are partnering with others. And we think that will open the door to additional indications for Ion in the lung and elsewhere. We are pretty excited about it. Apologies for not having the details of the trial at our fingertips, but I imagine our team will get that to you in the future.
Operator: Thank you. And next we have the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Matt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to get some updated thoughts, you have been asked a little bit about this in the recent past and on this call. But maybe you could give us some feedback on how you are thinking about capital spending from hospital customers going into recession and thinking about how this one could compare to what you have seen in the past with some of the different cycles that the company has gone through over a longer period of time, maybe do some compare and contrast and talk about the demand environment that you see out there and how you are going to compete for other priorities for capital?
Jamie Samath: Just with respect to prior cycles and this one actually, Matt, is a little interesting in so far as we indicated in Q1, we saw some softness in the capital pipeline in Q1 and Q2, and to some extent, that continued in Q3. If I look back at prior cycles in 2008, you saw three quarters of a year-over-year decline in capital placements, 2013 I think we saw five quarters in a row of declining capital placements and then when COVID hit in 2020, again, three quarters in a row. I only give those as reference points. I don’t think we can say that those are indicative as to what may happen if and when there’s a recession in the U.S. or beyond. So, I think, honestly, if you look at the progression of the economic projections, it’s pretty complex and hard to call at this point. So we just give those historical reference points.
Gary Guthart: Two comments for me, of course, the occurrence, the depth and the shape of a recession, impossible for us sitting at this table to predict. What I can talk about is how the conversations with hospital executives have gone. I think, in general, their perspective is to serve their patient population as best they can with technologies that will get the outcomes they want at the price points they want. I think we have been doing well with that. I think both on the product side and our ability to demonstrate economic viability and contribution margin gains for hospitals has been powerful and I think that gives us some strength going into the future. That said, depending on how hard and deep it is, then it becomes a question of what they want to offer their patient population and what kind of decisions they are going to have to make. I also think that relative to past cycles, Intuitive has a couple of more tools in the toolbox in terms of leasing portfolios and some other things. Hard to predict where it will go. I think our ability to both demonstrate value and adjust to capital placement models it’s a little stronger than it was in past years.
Operator: Thank you. And next we have Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Adam Maeder: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask about Ion, which if I am looking at it correctly, had a record placement for installs with also some very nice volume trends. So Gary or Jamie, can you just talk about kind of what’s driving that inflection in system placements? And then you referenced the PRECIsE data that was presented at CHEST I think earlier today, as well as the journal publication coming next year. Just talk about any potential impact to adoption looking forward.
Gary Guthart: I will jump in and Jamie you can help. I think we are still in the early market. We are pleased with the growth and the customer feedback that we have been getting the -- that -- and when we talk to them and survey our customers their satisfaction levels are very high with the Ion product. I think it’s driven by a couple of things. The preliminary data that’s come out of the PRECIsE trial that’s already been talked out and now the later data I think was attractive to the customer base. I think the other thing going on is that as we have installed additional sites and helped them bring their programs up, I think they are able to replicate that data. I think that it’s being commonly adopted. And I think that is having a compounding effect, the idea that the early publications are being repeated in the hands of new teams that are coming on board gives them confidence and this is a little bit of word of mouth amongst the pulmonology community, gives them confidence that they can get what’s being published and I think that’s been strong for us. Jamie, any comments?
Jamie Samath: I would just say there’s some endorsement of the architectural choices that we made with respect in particular to the diameter of the catheter, which makes a real difference to diagnosis of smaller lesions and you see that in the clinical data. I think that the engineering and the commercial teams have really executed really well through the period since we launched the product. And I do think that there’s a halo effect of kind of word of mouth across IPs and users of the product and I think in combination with clinical data, that’s had a positive effect on our progress so far. I wouldn’t characterize how we have progressed so far as an inflection specifically, I think we have made continued progression.
Operator: Thank you. And next we have the line of Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matt Miksic: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question and right, it’s a impressive quarter, so congrats on that as well. The -- I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things you talked about, one, in terms of the macro factors kind of affecting the market and your customers and your business a little bit. One being kind of the staffing challenges that some of these centers are facing. Curious how that is at all is affecting the way either procedures are coming back or demand for system is evolving here? And then into 2023, just curious some of the costs that you have talked about, everyone’s talked about. What -- I know it’s early to ask this kind of question, but your thoughts at this point as to how we should think about those costs evolving in 2023, it’s either sort of rising and staying or rising and then being able to be managed down or just in terms of your cost structure and how it’s increased, any thoughts you have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
Jamie Samath: Maybe the second part of the question I will take, Matt. So we are not going to give anything specific with respect to 2023 numbers. We will wait until January to do that when we conventionally provide guidance. I think what we have said with respect to operating expenses in 2023 for the reasons Gary described, the growth rate for that spending will be lower than the growth rate that we experienced in 2022 and a significant component of that is the number of people that we will hire next year. And again, what Gary described was, given the employees that we have hired, there’s a period here where we are going to ensure that we effectively onboard those new hires and get them to a state of productivity and this will be a period for us to go through that kind of absorption phase. I will let Gary respond to the first part.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Matt, could you -- I am sorry, I just missed a little bit of that first part of the question. Can you just restate that one?
Matt Miksic: Sure. Just in the context of factors affecting the ebbs and flows recovery, what have you of procedures and system -- new system trends, how staffing -- hospital staffing or challenges there are affecting those trends in your business if at all?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Fair question. It’s interesting. I think there’s a put and a take there. On the tough side, of course, if hospital staffing is really challenged, particularly as it relates to OR staff, that can limit procedures that they will perform. In general, I think, that folks are paying more to get OR staffed, recognizing they want to both treat those patients and it’s important to the revenue line of the hospital. So it’s primarily inflationary pressure as it relates to what’s happening in the OR in our space. The interesting part is that high quality MIS, minimally invasive surgery, of which we enable helps to offset some of the staffing requirements post-surgery. It’s quite clear, actually. So if they can do the procedure then the types of surgeries we do, it will save them some back end costs in staffing. So there’s a little bit of a seesaw there. So far I don’t think it’s improving in terms of staffing constraints very quickly. It does sound like it’s stabilized and maybe on the slight upside of improvement. Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: All right. We have the line of Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Drew Ranieri: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Gary, just maybe on Ion, can you -- I know it’s early days as you are kind of building the cells commercially, but a couple of questions. One is, are you supply constrained at all from meeting demand and then can you just give us a sense of maybe where you are in account penetration for Ion, whether it’s to interventional pulmonologist or at a hospital level? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: On the supply side, we are working extremely hard to meet demand on the capital side. I think we are about there. We are pretty close, pretty close to balanced. I don’t think we are way ahead or way behind. And likewise, on the consumable or per procedure side, we are working extremely hard to meet demand and I think we are slightly behind, not way ahead and not way behind. We are probably running close but pushing hard to keep growing. So on the penetration side, I think, we are a little bit early to go into share mix and things like that, I think we are not quite ready to describe where we are either on the account side or on the pulmonology side. So we will save that for a future call. Anyway, thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T event conferencing. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-21 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Thank you for standing by as today's conference assembled. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Quarter 2 2022 Earnings Release. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations with Intuitive Surgical, Mr. Brian King. Please go ahead.
Brian King: Thank you. So good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2022, and Form 10-Q filed on April 22, 2022. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our Q2 results reflect both environmental and Intuitive's specific headwinds accompanied by underlying business strength. Procedures in the quarter grew 14% over last year despite pressure from COVID-driven lockdowns in China, our second largest market. Capital placements slowed from a year ago due to a combination of factors we described last quarter and which I will review shortly. Overall pressure from COVID lockdowns impacted procedures in the quarter modestly while reduced trade-ins and supply chain timing impacted our capital placements more significantly. The leading indicator of the health of our business, procedure demand, remains healthy. Starting first with procedures. I am encouraged by 14% growth in the quarter, reflecting strength in U.S. general surgery and solid growth extending beyond urology outside the United States. U.S. procedure growth was led by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and colorectal procedures with continued growth in hernia repair. In OUS markets, procedures grew 22% in the quarter in spite of the COVID lockdown in China. Outside the U.S., we are seeing strength in urology now accompanied by diversified growth in other procedures. For example, in Japan, growth was strong in general surgery, including rectal resection. In the UK and Ireland, growth was strong in gynecology and general surgery. And in France, gynecology and general surgery experienced solid growth. System utilization in several OUS countries has been increasing in recent quarters as procedure adoption diversifies increasing value for our customers and for Intuitive. This is a result of the investments we made in key country markets starting several years ago. Turning to da Vinci capital placements. We placed 279 systems in the quarter, down from 328 in Q2 2021. In the da Vinci business, we see three causes for the decline in placements relative to a year ago. As our customers have standardized on generation four da Vinci systems, the installed base of third generation systems has declined, lowering the trade-in population, particularly in the United States. Next, supply chain disruption continued in the quarter with semiconductor component delays impacting the timing of system builds, leaving us challenged to match some customer orders at quarter end. Lastly, we've seen hospital capital spending pressure grow in our part of the capital equipment space over the past two quarters, incenting customers to seek efficiency gains on existing capital before acquiring new capacity. Component supply constraints remain a risk, and our operating teams are working hard to shelter our customers for most of these pressures. Capital placements in more mature markets are a mix of core demand for procedures and trade-in opportunities. The need for high-quality robotic-assisted surgery remains healthy. Incremental capital demand at the customer is a function of system utilization and procedure growth. On the system utilization side, our compound annual growth rate remains at historic levels of 5% over the past three-year period. System utilization in the U.S. over the past year was slightly down as procedure growth rate over the past year roughly matched the system installed base growth. In contrast, system utilization in many OUS markets has been rising as procedures diversify. Overall, we prioritize system utilization growth for customers as it increases the value to them of their investments and is aligned with long-term health for Intuitive. Turning to our innovation engines and new products and services, we placed 41 Ion systems, up from 20 in Q2 of last year. Given its stage of maturity, Ion capital demand procedure growth as hospitals seek to build initial capability. With the Ion clinical installed base now at 204 systems, Ion utilization has been growing nicely along with encouraging early capital replacements. We received 510(k) clearance for our integration of Ion with Siemens Cios Spin cone-beam CT. This combination improves registration and targeting precision for Ion in the lung and is being well received by our customers. We remain focused on strengthening clinical outcomes in lung care, a fantastic customer experience and operational excellence in the Ion program. In our multiport ecosystem, we initiated our first phase U.S. launch of our eight millimeter stapler designed to work in small anatomical spaces, for example, in thoracic surgery. Early customer feedback has been encouraging. In China, we're preparing to launch our SureForm 45 and 60 millimeter staplers and our latest endoscope, Endoscope Plus. All three will continue to support growth in general surgery and thoracic procedures. For da Vinci SP, we have expanded the number of colorectal IDE sites to help accelerate accrual, and we submitted another regulatory package for SP imaging and accessories in Japan, as we work on the necessary clearances to support an SP launch in the country. For our digital tools, Intuitive Hub installs grew nicely again in the quarter, and we're focused on ensuring outstanding customer experiences with data capture and media management, along with increasing utilization over time. On spending, we are committed to our innovation programs because we believe the forward opportunity for our products and services are important to our customers and to the company. We have some natural shock absorbers that decrease some of our variable spending as a result of the slowdown in da Vinci capital placements. We are also planning for decelerating spend growth after we complete some infrastructure projects, we need to support the company's expansion. Given our confidence in the future of our business, we have also returned cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks in the quarter. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie who will take you through our finances in greater detail.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q2 procedure growth of 14% reflected an increase in U.S. procedures of 11% and OUS procedure growth of 22%. As a reminder procedures in the U.S. in the second quarter of last year included a recovery of procedures that were delayed as a result of the significant impact of Omicron variant. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. We placed 279 systems in the second quarter as compared to 328 systems in the second quarter of 2021 and 311 systems last quarter. Q2 system placements were 15% lower than the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to a significant decline in trade-in transactions. There were 56 trade-in transactions in the quarter as compared to 125 in Q2 of 2021, reflecting the decline in the number of SIs remaining in the installed base. The supply chain environment continues to be challenging and during the quarter we experienced delays in the supply of certain semiconductor components that caused manufacturing output of da Vinci systems to be later in the quarter than historical norms. As a result, a number of systems that we would have expected to place in the latter part of June experienced minor delays and were shipped and installed in July. We indicated on last quarter’s call that we had experienced softening in the U.S. capital pipeline. That softness persisted in Q2. Financial pressures have increased on hospitals, given higher inflation, increasing interest rates, supply chain challenges, and continued staffing shortages. Some of the larger IDNs have indicated that as a consequence of the financial pressures they face, they are lowering their capital investment plans and tightening operational budgets. We expected demand for capital, particularly in the U.S., will be impacted while macro conditions remain challenging. Where a particular hospital requires additional da Vinci capacity, given growth in their programs, we will leverage our flexible acquisition models to meet the financial objectives of our customers. Given the system placements in Q2, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew approximately 13% year-over-year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system increased approximately 1% compared to last year. Using a three-year compound annual growth rate second quarter utilization grew almost 5%, which is in line with historical averages. In more mature markets like the U.S. capital demand is sensitive to procedure growth. And therefore we monitor changes in system utilization closely. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q2 revenue was $1.52 billion, an increase of 4% from the second quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis second quarter revenue grew approximately 6% over last year. It is worth highlighting that recurring revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $1.24 billion representing 81% of total revenue. Additional revenue, statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we've placed 150 systems in the second quarter lower than the 213 in Q2 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 59 systems associated with trade-in transactions, a softer demand environment, and the delay of some system placements into July. The remaining installed base of SI systems in the U.S. is approximately 230 systems. Outside the U.S., we placed 129 systems in the second quarter compared with 115 in the second quarter of 2021. Current core assistant placements included 78 into Europe, 18 into Japan, and 15 into China, compared with 63 into Europe, 16 into Japan, and 19 into China in the second quarter of 2021. As of the end of Q2 2022, there were 48 systems remaining under the current quarter in China, which is also available to competitors that have received local regulatory clearance. Globally, trade-in transactions represented 20% of placements in the quarter, compared to 38% for full year 2021 and 48% for full year 2020. As we have previously indicated, given the lower number of older generation systems in the field, we expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022, as compared to last year. Leasing represented 42% of Q2 placements compared with 35% last quarter and 33% in the second quarter of 2021, the higher lease mix primarily reflected an increase in the proportion of O-U.S. customers that lease a system in the quarter versus purchased, driven in particular by customers in Europe. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Second quarter system average selling prices were $1.50 million slightly lower than the $1.54 million last quarter, although system ASPs were roughly flat, lower trade-in volumes benefitted Q2 ASP, offset by an unfavorable impact from the stronger U.S. dollar and a higher mix of lower price Xi systems, primarily driven by customers in Europe. We recognized $22 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $16 million last quarter and $26 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,900 per procedure, compared with $1,870 last quarter and $1,940 in the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q2 of 2021 associated with the launch of our extended use instruments program and an unfavorable FX impact from the stronger U.S. dollar. The sequential increase reflects a higher proportion of stapling and advanced energy revenue. Revenue for these categories combined grew 22% as compared to the second quarter of last year. We placed 41 Ion systems in the quarter as compared to 20 Ion placements in the second quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 204 systems of which 90 are under operating lease arrangements. Second core Ion procedures of approximately 5,200 increased 251% compared to the second core of 2021. Ion is in the new MDR regulatory review process in Europe and our efforts to pursue a submission in China continue to make progress. Five of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, resulting in an installed base of 111. Second core SP procedures grew approximately 28% year-over-year. One of the areas of potential clinical differentiation for SP is in narrow access surgery. For example, in transoral robotic surgical or TORS procedures, for malignant TORS procedures based on the last four quarters, we estimate SP market share in the U.S. to be just under 20%. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the U.S. and Korea. Moving on to the rest of the P&L, pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 69.2% compared with 71.7% for the second quarter of 2021 and 69.8% last quarter. Pro forma gross margin was lower primarily as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar, higher logistics costs, increased component pricing and increased fixed cost relative to revenue. As we invest in our infrastructure and manufacturing capacity to serve our long-term needs. Pro forma operating expenses increased 23% compared with the second quarter of 2021. The increase in second quarter operating expenses from a year ago, reflected an increase in headcount, higher R&D-related project costs and higher travel costs, including the impact of inflation. Given the early stages of our newer platforms, Ion and SP and our digital ecosystem, we expect to continue to invest in R&D, given the return profile of these investments. Spending in SG&A will be more closely linked to our procedure and revenue performance, and we will continue to pursue plans to invest in infrastructure and business process automation to ensure we can efficiently and effectively scale. Pro forma operating margin for Q2 was 35% as compared to 40% for the full year 2021. As compared to the second quarter of last year, the net impact of FX, inflation and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the supply chain environment is a reduction in operating margin of approximately 2%. Our pro forma tax rate – effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.3%, in line with our expectations. Second quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $415 million or $1.14 per share compared with $475 million or $1.30 per share for the second quarter of 2021. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $131 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint, increased manufacturing capacity and automation of certain production lines. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $308 million or $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2022, compared with GAAP net income of $517 million or $1.42 per share for the second quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $8.2 billion, compared with $8.4 billion at the end of Q1. The sequential reduction in cash and investments primarily reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent and are as follows: first, to organically invest in the business, given the significant opportunities we see to develop differentiated technology and drive adoption of our products. Second, to acquire external technology that creates value for our customers and/or accelerate development timelines or acquisitions that accelerate our growth. Third, we return excess cash to shareholders and look to do so efficiently. In Q2, we repurchased 2.2 million of our shares at an average price of $224 per share for a total expenditure of $500 million. Concurrent with today’s earnings release, our Board of Directors have improved an increase to the share repurchase authorization to $3.5 billion. With that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022.
Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Our overall second quarter 2022 procedure growth was 14%, compared to 68% for the second quarter of 2021, which we believe benefited from a number of procedures which had previously been deferred due to COVID-19. The three-year compound annual growth rate was 16% between the second quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2022. In the U.S., second quarter 2022 procedure growth was 11% year-over-year, compared to 77% for the second quarter of 2021 and 16% last quarter. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, U.S. procedure growth was 14%. Q2 procedure growth continued to be driven by general surgery, with particular strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and colorectal, while hernia and foregut were also strong contributors. Growth in mature urology and gynecology procedures also continue but at a moderate pace in the low-single digits. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure volume grew approximately 22%, compared with 51% for the second quarter of 2021 and 25% last quarter. Despite COVID-related restrictions in China, on a three-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 20%. Turning to Europe. Procedure growth was led by strong growth in Italy, UK and Germany. In all three regions noted, procedure growth was strong in general surgery and gynecology. In Italy, growth in these procedures outside of urology was led by general surgery, specifically in colorectal and HPV procedures. In Germany, growth in these categories was led by early stage growth in colorectal surgery and benign hysterectomy. Year-over-year procedure growth in these non-urology procedures was almost 3 times higher than urology. While in the UK, benign hysterectomy and colorectal resection experienced strong early-stage growth. In Asia, we experienced strong growth in Japan, while in China, procedures remain below expectations as government restrictions continued due to COVID infections that persisted throughout most of the quarter. In Japan, growth in general surgery and gynecology continued to be strong with robust growth, specifically in benign hysterectomy, rectal resection and gastrectomy. In addition, prostatectomy continued with solid double-digit growth, reflecting a recovery when compared to the prior year, which was constrained by COVID. Further contributing to procedure strength was early growth in the adoption of newly reimbursed procedures namely colon resection and nephrectomy procedures. In China, second quarter procedure growth continued to be negatively impacted by regional lockdowns due to ongoing COVID infections that affected many large cities throughout most of the quarter. Despite the restrictions, China experienced modest year-over-year growth and began to show signs of a return to normal run rates in June. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Earlier this year, Dr. Sarah Diez and Robert Cleary from St. Joseph Mercy Hospital Ann Arbor, along with Doctors Young Jin Lee and Amira Basara from the Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle, Washington and in collaboration with Intuitive, published a real-world body of evidence comparing health care utilization outcomes and payer/patient expenditures associated with open and minimally invasive colectomy for benign disease. Notably, this analysis also included a comparison of laparoscopic and da Vinci approaches. Utilizing the IBM MarketScan commercial claims and encounter database, this study included over 10,000 adult patients who between January 2013 and December 2018 underwent an elective inpatient colectomy for a benign condition with over 2,500 patients in the open group and over 6,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group and over 1,000 patients in the da Vinci Group. Through an inverse propensity treatment weighted analysis, the minimally invasive approach demonstrated a lower total health care expenditure across all time frames analyzed from the surgical procedure through 365 days post procedure, with lower average total expenditures ranging from $2,300 to $8,100. With regards to resource utilization, the minimally invasive approach demonstrated an approximately two-day lower length of stay with these patients less likely to be readmitted, visit the emergency department or visit the outpatient department within 365 days from the procedure. The reduction in health care use among minimally invasive patients translated to an additional savings over $5,700 and over two fewer days missed from work for health care visits. Within the MIS category when comparing laparoscopic and da Vinci approaches, da Vinci had a 70% lower risk of conversion to open with over a half day shorter length of stay and patients were less likely to have an outpatient hospital visit within one year of the procedure. Of note, patients who had a conversion to open had a longer length of stay, higher hospital payments and were more likely to have a readmission for hospital visit within one year of the procedure. The reduction in conversion is translated to an additional savings of approximately $4,800 and 1.5 fewer days of missed work due to health care visits. The authors concluded in part that minimally invasive colectomy is associated with lower mean health care expenditures and less mean health care resource utilization compared to the open approach for benign disease, with a shorter mean length of stay and conversion to open rate observed with the da Vinci approach. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2022 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 16%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2022 procedure growth of 14% to 16.5%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of the range assumes increasing COVID hospitalization and staffing pressure at hospitals for the remainder of the year. At the high end of the range, we assume COVID-19-related hospitalizations around the world continue to decline throughout the remainder of 2022, and there are no additional significant impacts from further resurgences. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we experienced at the start of the pandemic. While procedure growth so far in the first half of 2022 has been healthy, the capital pipeline in the U.S. has been softer than in prior periods, mainly due to a lower number of SI systems in the installed base available for trade-in and macro-related headwinds creating pressure on the hospital capital spending. Capital placements in more mature markets are a function of procedure demand that is moderated by system utilization growth and trade-in opportunities. While trade-in opportunities have declined, the core demand for procedures continues to be healthy and system utilization has been increasing. With a three-year compound annual growth rate in procedures of 16% from Q2 of 2019 to Q2 of 2022 and installed base growth of 11% over the same period, utilization of installed systems has continued to increase through the pandemic and first half of 2022. This is increasing the value derived from the existing installed base for our customers and for us. As we look ahead, we expect these capital dynamics to continue for the foreseeable future. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2022 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70.5%. We are now refining our estimate of pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70% of net revenue. Given the ongoing impact of higher input costs related to supply chain and the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, we would expect to be towards the lower end of that range. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trading mix, fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the impact of new product introductions. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 27%. We are refining our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 25%. We are refining our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between $520 million to $540 million in 2022. We are also refining our estimate for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $60 million and $70 million in 2022, an increase from our previous estimate of $50 million and $60 million. The increase primarily reflects the continued rise in interest rates. On last quarter’s call, we forecast 2022 capital expenditures within a range of $700 million to $900 million. We are now refining estimated capital expenditures for 2022 to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’re going to begin today with Larry Biegelsen representing Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Gary, maybe if I could start with the supply constraints that you talked about, could you quantify how much you think that negatively impacted Q2? It sounds like they’ve been resolved. And Gary, obviously, people are worried about the impact of a recession. How are you better positioned this time compared to the last recession we saw in 2008, 2009? And I have one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Okay. On the supply constraint side, I’ll give you a qualitative perspective and Jamie you can fill in a little bit of a quantitative perspective. What’s happening is semiconductor suppliers and some other raw material suppliers giving us choppy delivery time lines. So estimates that are sometimes moving around and that can bring product in late in the quarter. When we assemble that product, it can sometimes make it hard at very quarter end to match system configurations to customers and that’s largely what happened in Q2. Jamie, you want to add to that?
Jamie Samath: Think about the impact to Q2 placements roughly in the 5%-ish range in terms of without those supply constraints, those delayed semiconductor components the incremental systems that would have been delivered in Q2.
Gary Guthart: That continues to be choppy, and we expect, certainly for Q3 and perhaps forward that we’ll continue to fight those fights in terms of timing of supply. On the second question – the second part of your question on recession, clearly, our hospital customers are under financial pressure. We have seen that at the end of Q1 and had communicated with you at that time. I think relative to where we were as Intuitive a decade ago, the size and strength of the installed base, the relative position that we have in terms of centrality to surgery and multiple disciplines and the expression of that in recurring revenue, the percentage of our business that’s in recurring revenue, I think gives us a little bit better shock absorption and predictability in terms of a large part of the revenue of the business. And gives us a few more degrees of freedom in terms of how we make our investments and time those investments relative to 2008, 2009. We are close with our customers. I am personally in contact with many. The trends that we’ve been describing to you, I think we understood pretty well the size and duration of those trends in terms of pressure, very hard for any of us to predict. And you had a follow-on.
Larry Biegelsen: Yes, that’s all fair. Again, I’m going to push my luck a little bit here. FDA seems to be requiring clinical data for new systems. We know you have a new system in development. So my question is, do you know yet if FDA is going to require clinical data for your new system before approval? And if so, what can you share? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Looking at two things, I think let me broaden the question. Looking at the regulatory environment globally and in particular, in the United States and Europe, we have seen a trend in medical device and in robotic-assisted surgery for increasing data requirements. Sometimes those are trials, sometimes there are other kind of data. That trend has continued, and it’s impacting all of us in the market, including Intuitive. You can expect that we will improve the Gen 4 product that’s out there. We can get good ideas and technologies into our existing customer base hands and improve their utility, we will do that. We are, of course, working on next generations. And as I’ve said before, generations after that, without answering your question specifically, the deeper the technologic opportunities and the clinical impact, the more likely you have a deeper validation work to do. And we’re not afraid of that work. I’d rather do things that are really clinically meaningful for the customer. And if we have to do the work, then we’ll do the work. I will say for everybody on the call, it’s clear that relative to a decade ago, the investment trough and the time lines for new systems have both increased. The time lines have increased because of the changing regulatory environments in several countries. And as a result, the amount of investment that has to go into that has also changed. It’s also increased. I think, and this is a prediction that it will also extend the useful life of products that we design. So it’s taking a little longer to get to market than it used to, maybe more than a little, it’s costing us more to get there. But that change in environment also means that really well-designed systems probably have longer use for life in the field. And I think we’re starting to see that early evidence of that as well. So thank you for the question, Larry.
Larry Biegelsen: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we’ll go to the line of Amit Hazan representing Goldman Sachs. You’re open.
Amit Hazan: Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe to come back to the supply chain question. I want to maybe ask it lends as kind of a bigger picture here, just given all the challenges you’ve gone through in the past year and a half or so. Do you have plans that change strategically in terms of evolving towards maybe regionalization or domestication of the supply chain? And how do we think about that and incremental costs that might come with that, if that’s the plan? Or do you just plan to kind of ride this out and expect a more normal environment next year?
Gary Guthart: I’ll start, and Jamie, you can lean in. First, I want to acknowledge our operating teams and the supply chain teams. They have done a spectacular job in the number of components that we manage in a robotic surgery system, both on the capital side and on the instruments and accessories side and the management of those supply chains is remarkable, perhaps bigger than most people expect relative to the size of our company. They have been really good at being proactive and thoughtful about supply chain, robustness about strategic reserves and about the ability to pivot into alternative components when we need to. And that has really been a spectacular performance. That’s a long way of saying that they have been proactive. They will continue to be forward-looking and design for supply chain robustness. What that looks like depends a lot on the underlying product, whether it’s creating second sources or using alternatives or thinking about regional deployment. We have been working through regional deployment prior to the pandemic, and we’ve done that work as we’ve gone on. That does incur some costs. We’re thoughtful about it. And Jamie, why don’t you provide your perspective?
Jamie Samath: From a strategic perspective or a long-term perspective, setting aside the current supply chain challenges, some of the things that we consider in our own long-term planning is the size of our business as it grows over time in the various regions that we serve, where you might locate, redundant capacity or incremental capacity. And in terms of the economic equation, you’re trading the potential cost of redundancy with savings on freight and logistics to the extent that you can supply them in region. That economic analysis is relatively straightforward. And really, you’re just looking for the degree of redundancy you want and when does the regional businesses get big enough to warrant the economics. But certainly, what you described is something that we’re looking at carefully and have been.
Amit Hazan: Thanks for that. And maybe just to hit on just earnings and going into the future with the components that you give us, it seems pretty clear this year, we’re probably not going to get earnings growth. You had some interesting comments. It sounds like R&D, you’re going to keep spending and you believe what you’re doing organically that makes sense. And sir, if you have more comments on SG&A, but just thinking through, okay, no earnings this year, in terms of your commitment to shareholders, is it okay for you not to grow earnings next year, too? Would that become a bigger focus for you just given how this year has gone? How do you think about earnings growth after kind of what this year is going to end up looking like? Thanks.
Jamie Samath: Yes. So, we’re not going to get specific about 2023 at this point. You’ll obviously see us provide our outlook on the January call. What we’re doing with respect to R&D currently is investing in multiyear projects and investments. You see that in our newer platforms, Ion and SP. We have obviously investments in digital, many of which are at an early stage. And we do continue to invest in the fourth generation ecosystem. And we look at the returns on those investments carefully and have confidence in them. But in part because of the regulatory time lines that Gary described, they are multiyear investments and we think that the returns there are quite attractive. And so that’s why you see, for example, if you look at the first half, our R&D grew 30% relative to the overall growth of about 25% for OpEx. But if you take a multiyear view, given the growth opportunities that we see, you’d expect us to grow earnings over time. I’m not going to say whether that’s 2023 yet or not. And with respect to operating margins, specifically, what we’ve said is we look to be at the high end of our medtech peer set. And by medtech, that means high-growth companies that have growth opportunities as we see that we do. I'll speak to – for a second on SG&A. We do have some infrastructure that is either needs to be built out to support the growth particularly in manufacturing or we have some processes in IT and in other parts of the business where we're long lived on our pavement and there's some repaving or potholes to fix that we will finish. We do expect to see highly targeted spending in that area going forward. And as we retire, some of that project spend will be thoughtful about where we go next. So we'll start to see some of that expense start to titrate into next year.
Amit Hazan: Thank you.
Operator: Okay. Next in the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Travis Steed: All right. Thanks for taking the questions. Gary, I'd love a little more color just on the overall hospital capital environment. Are you seeing hospitals just being more cautious on the near term or do you think we're in for a longer duration CapEx, slowdown? I'm curious how you think the slowdown could range in terms of outcomes, if it's like, 2008, 2009 or 2013, 2014 or 2020 and also like leases ticked up to 42% this quarter, I'm curious where you think that could peak in the slower CapEx environment?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Hard to predict the depth in duration of hospital pressure. So I won't, I will talk about what the – I think what the inputs are, what they're faced with. Clearly, they're constrained on labor and the labor costs because of that constraint have gone up. That's not something that will resolve quickly. They're also facing inflationary pressure in some of their materials that they purchase, and they don't have enormous flexibility to change pricing on their side. So I would expect profitability constraint on the hospital side to be present. In light of that, one of their first tools in their toolkit is to try to get greater productivity out of existing assets and capital, and Intuitive will help them. If there's more productivity to get out of the products they already owned, we will help them do that. I still think there are hospitals out there that are going to be strategic that are in better financial condition. And if they want to build a new capacity and a new product line says SP or Ion or to branch out into a new region, then they'll do that. And we'll help them do that as well. I don't think this is a one or two quarter resolution. It's certainly going to be something longer than that. With regard to change in lease and how do we think about leases going forward? Jamie, I'll ask you to take that.
Jamie Samath: Yeah. If I split between U.S. and O-U.S., what you've seen in the U.S. is relative maturity in understanding and acceptance use of our leasing program. It's been ticking up slowly over time while it will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on customer preference. I do think that will slowly continue to tick up just based on what we hear from customers. In O-U.S. where we offer leasing, which is not in every market, we’re at an earlier stage. And so you're seeing growing understand and acceptance as leasing as an option as they acquire capital. And so I'd expect that to continue to climb over time.
Travis Steed: Great. Thank you. And I had one other question, Gary, listened to your talk a few weeks ago, and you mentioned the time it takes to get new parts to market is a couple of years longer. I think you said six to eight years before now, eight to 10 years. I'd love to kind of get in a little more detail on that assumption that you went through there. And kind of think is, I guess I assume it's mostly regulatory, but kind of dig into the comment a bit more and see how that's changed your strategic thinking in general of how you think about innovation and your product cycles at the moment?
Gary Guthart: Yeah, it was a kind of a directional comment more about averages than about a particular product line. So I discourage anybody looking at a particular product line and try to infer from it. We have a basket of things we do and on average, it's gotten longer. Strategically I think there are a couple of things that strengths in the business versus a decade ago that help us and give us more flexibility, more freedom. And that is both the deep penetration we have in the market, the large size of the customer base in terms of active users. If we can get them a technology and increments, we’re not as dependent on capital revenue. And as years pass, I think, the recurring revenue side is a strength for us. If that increases productivity for the hospital, that’s great. It turns out that gives them better financial returns on the investments they made. But also our economic profile is stronger in repeat use utilization than it is in capital change. So what that means to us is bring capital change when it really is differentiated, when it really brings incremental clinical value or new market access to our customers. And that’s what we’re focused on. With regard to the regulatory side, our goal is to be really good at it to get the right data we need at the right time to underwrite the first time and take care of it. And those types of requirements ebb and flow over time. And we’re in a particular state where the requirements are quite high and we’ll deal with it.
Travis Steed: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: And we’ll go to the line of Robbie Marcus representing JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Robbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start, a lot of your comments say, it feels like it’s a U.S. comment in terms of the capital equipment. I want to get a sense, is there any difference in geography just given the hospitals, most of them outside the U.S., are dictated by a single payer country networks. And then I’ll just ask the follow-up as well, pretty good OUS procedure number. How do we think about how much of an impact the shutdowns in China had and how should we be thinking about the ramp in second half on China, just given that the country is still not on a strong pathway to a reopening? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Robbie, on that first question, it’s a good one. And I appreciate it. Clearly, the utilization of systems and the posture of hospital acquisition relative to systems differs by country based on the maturity of our markets and the depth of penetration of da Vinci. We tried to call that out a little bit in the script. Jamie, I don’t know if there’s additional color you’d like to apply.
Jamie Samath: Yes, I just say the softness in the U.S. capital pipeline is clear, and it’s been clear for two quarters. What you saw in placements in Q2 was actually OUS placements grew as compared to a year ago. We haven’t seen any clear and specific indications on capital weakness that I call out. Obviously, China had a challenging quarter with respect to procedures. But you look at the macro, you look at what’s happening in Europe. You could imagine that might be a challenge as you look forward, but nothing that I call out at this point.
Gary Guthart: On – you had asked kind of how do we expect China to proceed in procedures in the back half. Of course that’s impossible for us to predict what I might ask Brian is you might just reiterate some of your comments as what’s assumed in the model in terms of [indiscernible].
Brian King: Yes. So we have seen, I’d say at the end of Q2, we did see some improvement or recovery of procedures, I’d say probably closer to more normal levels. Over time, it’s really hard to predict what’s going to happen in China. I think they are our second largest market by procedure volume. It does have an impact when things do slow down, but you can see the procedure growth that we had despite the challenges in China. So I think it’s probably a bit too soon to really give any color and what’s going to happen there because there's just still so much variability and frankly, we were still really early in the quarter.
Robbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: And we have a question from Rick Wise representing Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Good afternoon, guys. Again, reflecting on history a little bit. When I think back to the end of the financial crisis to early last decade, obviously, there were periods of marked capital slowdown and yes, those – the recovery following that was in part of macro recovery. But it was also in 2014, the launch of the Xi, it was procedure volume uptake, expanded instruments. I mean, there were many drivers of the recovery under the umbrella of the macro recovery. As we look ahead and think about the next few years assuming the macro recovery occurs, I was just reflecting that the mix might be different this time, but what’s the – on the procedure side and the system or instrument side, I mean, what are the drivers that get us back to that accelerated growth again? Is it international instruments and yes, inevitably a new system at some point, or how would you talk about the next few years in thinking about a recovery from this period?
Gary Guthart: Appreciate the question. In terms of drivers of growth, first kind of zoom out, we are in the thick part of the adoption curve in the United States in general surgery across multiple sub-procedures and there's real room there. I don't think we're saturated and response has been really good and our training numbers and adoption and the underlying capability of our Gen 4 products has been great; so that's one. Two, we're seeing investments that we've made many years ago in rounded teams, rounded intuitive teams in key countries payback now, and that has been fantastic. So it starts with growth in oncology, oncologic surgical procedures outside of urology – in addition to urology, so we're seeing that but we're also seeing the early indications of adoption in benign surgery in our U.S. markets, which is frankly an exciting green shoot in the sense that that could follow a pathway that mirrors what we saw in the U.S. So I think there's lots of opportunity there and, and that has to do with bringing our instruments, our accessories, our ecosystem, our training capabilities, our data capabilities into our priority country markets over time. So we've got that. We have outstanding innovations that are coming to market. Ion is doing really well in the U.S. Ion will go deeper into other applications. We're trying to bring it to Europe or in that process will bring it to Asia over time. SP, SP is having great success in Korea. We're bringing it to Japan. We're working on additional indications for the United States. SP has differentiated capability, and as those indications get added and it's hard work I think it will bring incremental procedures to our customers and then to us over time. And those are procedures that are either rarely done with daVinci or not done with daVinci at all. And I think that's another leg of opportunity and how many years does that take? Well, they will layer out – those things will layer out over time. In terms of regional performance we have those opportunities in front of us right now. In terms of things like SP and Ion; SP is one of the more mature technologies in new platform. I think its economics are looking increasingly good for intuitive, and as they continue to knock down additional clinical indications I think that'll add strength. Ion has been growing like a weed. It's less mature in terms of its financial profile, but we're working hard on it and so I think those things will contribute as well. So I think we have irons in the fire that we have confidence in.
Rick Wise: Okay. And just one last quick one for me, it's a little bit of a fishing expedition kind of question of just reflecting on your comments about partnering with hospitals. One aspect is financially and with leases, et cetera, but I know you have many initiatives underway in terms of data collection and management, any update in terms of your initiatives there? And is there anything on that side of the house we should be paying attention to? Thank you, Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thanks Rick. On the basics in our more mature daVinci markets, our data facility and in terms of the ability to collect, analyze and share insight with our hospitals has been really good. And they are the things that allow them to compare the efficacy and efficiency of their daVinci program. Relative to others in their own hospital group relative to national and international norms, it allows them to make decisions about where capacity are going, where there are opportunities for improvement within their system? We use that routinely. It is not a new idea; it's starting to become really baked into all the workflows and processes. We're automating a lot of that capability, so that's been fabulous. At the other end of the spectrum we are engaged with hardcore healthcare researchers looking at what AI and our data sets can bring in terms of improved outcomes, personalized training, faster time to competency and the excitement level there is quite high, and we're continuing to invest down that pathway. So in one set, it's used every day and another set, I think, it's in the innovation engines and its informing discovery. And I believe those discoveries, in a few years, will change the nature of surgery and some of the training that we do. So I think there's an opportunity on both sides.
Rick Wise: Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Just one last question, please.
Operator: All right. Our final question today will come from the line of Richard Newitter representing Truist. You’re open.
Richard Newitter: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Gary, just on that last answer. Can you give us any sense as to how if and maybe even when you might look to begin monetizing those types of – I don't want to say new alternative service models, things that might help hospitals become more efficient. Can we expect to see that filter into new sources of revenue streams and when? And are you already exploring that? And then I have one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: I – we've said this before, in our digital efforts in terms of digital tools, some of them are – the way we do our financial analysis, some of them are value creating through efficiency and labor savings on our side or on the hospital side and the investments are really a reduction in our cost to serve. So that's one category. There's another category that is around accelerated time to competency that lowers our cost to serve through having people get through their implementation and programmatic processes more quickly. The third category is direct revenue opportunity. We have things in the field working in all three of those categories. So none of them is empty. In terms of pricing and customer acceptance of our value proposition, we are out in our training opportunities in some of our augmented reality spaces and in our Intuitive Hub starting to explore those. Some of them are very, very early. Some of them are reasonably mature in terms of what our pricing and other models look like. What I would tell you is that relative to other sources of revenue, these should be accretive to our bottom line because of some of the cost savings, but they won't be huge revenue lines in the near term. I would not set the expectation that all of that turns into big time revenue. Our biggest thing and our focus is to help our customers, hospitals get to great, high-functioning, minimally invasive surgery programs using our products. If we do that, then they will find a way to pay us. And so far, that economic engine has worked well for them and it's worked well for us.
Richard Newitter: Great. And just – you guys mentioned TORS, I believe, where SP is gaining traction. You've got 20% penetration. I think you estimated – of U.S. estimated procedures. Just remind us, how big of a category is TORS? Can you quantify that for us? And where do you think something like that could go? Or where are some of your more aggressive users in terms of their penetration already? Thank you.
Jamie Samath: Yes. On the micro question, so that was malignant TORS. It's a small but high-value segment. Roughly TAM number of surgeries performed is in the 10,000 per year range. So a relatively small market. But like I said, for surgeons and patients, really high value. In terms of where it might go, I'll let Gary expand on that.
Gary Guthart: Yes. I think that SP and invasive surgery has opportunities to extend the kinds of procedures that are done robotically and we'll look to Korea as a guide in that they have broad clearances. And they're using it all over the body from gynecology to breast oncology and other things where they see value. And I think that as that clinical evidence comes through and as the clearances expand, you'll see incremental opportunity that is reasonable for us and, I think, exciting for our customer base. We'll detail those things further in future calls as that data starts to publish. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple lane: Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It follows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a care, a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Event Services. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-21 19:04:03) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Intuitive Q1 2022 Earnings Release. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.  And as a reminder your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Brian King, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brian King: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call maybe deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3rd, 2022. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC’s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. And finally we will host a question-and-answer session. With that I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter procedure demand for our products was healthy recovering where COVID receded. Drivers of procedure performance included general surgery in the US and non-urology procedures outside of the US, which are our areas of focus. Regardless of the health of procedure demand we were challenged by environmental stresses including regional waves of COVID, staffing pressure at hospitals, component and raw material availability and logistic delays. While it's difficult to forecast how long these headwinds will persist, our teams are working hard to meet the challenge. In the quarter da Vinci procedures grew 19%, compared to the first quarter 2021. The use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States grew nicely led by bariatric procedures, cholecystectomy, hernia repair and rectal surgery. Lobectomy growth was also healthy. Outside the United States, the UK, China, Japan Germany and Italy grew above our quarterly average growth rate, but I will note that some countries saw the beginnings of COVID slowdowns later in the quarter in particular china and Korea. International use of da Vinci is diversifying beyond urology in several countries with growth in oncologic procedures in thoracic surgery, gynecology and general surgery. In Japan, MHLW increased reimbursement for robotically assisted gastrectomy and added another eight procedures to reimbursement coverage in April, bringing the total number of covered da Vinci procedure types to over 25 in Japan. In our flexible robotics program, Ion procedures grew approximately 350% in Q1, compared with Q1 2021, reflecting continued strength in adoption and utilization of the platform. Turning to capital. Our team installed 311 da Vinci systems in the quarter compared with 298 systems in Q1 2021, bringing our total clinical installed base to 6,920 da Vinci systems. Placements varied by region with the UK standing out with a strong placement quarter. Capital placements have been historically lumpy and after several quarters of capital strength we're seeing some near-term softening of our capital placement pipeline in the US. Contributing factors may include a pull-forward of Q1 2022 demand into Q4 2021 due to customer budget utilization at year end, a reduction in the number of third-generation da Vinci systems available for trade-ins and an overall tightening of hospital finances. With the three-year CAGR and procedures of 15% from Q1 of 2019 to Q1 of 2022 and installed base growth of 11% over the same period utilization of installed systems continue to climb through the pandemic and in the first quarter. This is increasing the value derived from the existing installed base for our customers and for us. Over the mid-term capital demand in mature robotic-assisted surgery segments is a function of procedure demand moderated by utilization growth. Jamie will give regional capital trends and Brian will give a more detailed procedure review later in the call. As we exit the first quarter, we continued to invest in global expansion, innovation initiatives and our business infrastructure. Our spending in the quarter was roughly in line with our target. In instruments and accessories, we received Chinese NMPA clearance for our 45-millimeter and 60-millimeter SureForm staplers, our Vessel Sealer Extend and our Endoscope Plus. These products support the utility of our Xi systems for several procedures, particularly, general and thoracic surgeries. Turning to Ion. We submitted our EU medical device regulation application for the platform to allow the entry of Ion into Europe. Our teams are also building production capability and -- capacity pardon me and making improvements to customer workflow planning software and reprocessing efficiency. In digital products, the My Intuitive app community tripled year-over-year and is now available in the US, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom and Ireland and Switzerland with launches set for Italy, Spain and India in Q2. Building on our Orpheus technology our teams in Israel and the US have created Intuitive Hub, a unified hardware and software solution for the operating room. Intuitive Hub enables OR teams to capture, edit and share video clips from clinical procedures and collaborate virtually using existing workflows and Intuitive systems. In the quarter, we launched an upgraded interface to da Vinci systems that allows for automated video capture with integrated procedure annotation for key events creating convenient video storage and review for each cases. Customer feedback for this integration has been encouraging. Across the installed base the number of procedures in which Intuitive Hub was used grew approximately 60% year-over-year. To our goal of adding Iris anatomical models, we're in conversations with FDA on how best to characterize some of its core AI technology, which will require a resubmission of our 510(k) for the next set of segmented organ models. Finally, the installed base of our virtual reality training simulator SimNow grew 33% in the quarter compared with a year ago. For our single port program da Vinci SP, we began the launch of our next-generation SP endoscope which includes our Firefly Fluorescence Imaging technology and has 65% longer life. We also launched our next-generation core SP instruments that can apply higher forces during surgery and are more durable. Feedback on both has been encouraging. In Japan we submitted our da Vinci SP for clearance to PMDA seeking broad indications. We continue to pursue additional indications for SP in the US, which is important for broader adoption, with an ongoing IDE trial in colorectal surgery, and an approved IDE for thoracic surgery. COVID and some site-specific delays have slowed our progress in our colorectal trial. We're working hard to expand the number of participating sites to accelerate its completion. Stepping back, for 2022, our top priority is to support, supply and train our customers as they navigate a challenging environment. We are also focused on helping general surgeons in the United States adopt our technologies and diversifying our business outside the United States beyond urology and executing on our new platforms and digital tools. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie Samath, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Overall, Q1 results reflected approximately 19% procedure growth as compared to the first quarter of 2021 and system placements of 311 systems, resulting in an expansion of the installed base of da Vinci systems of approximately 13%. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q1 revenue increased by 15% year-over-year. Key business metrics for the first quarter of 2022 were as follows. Within the 19% procedure growth, procedures in the US increased 16% and OUS procedures grew by 25%. Procedures in the US were impacted in January by the significant number of hospitalizations related to the Omicron variant. As rates of COVID-related hospitalizations declined in February and March, da Vinci procedures recovered quickly. On a three-year compound annual growth rate basis, first quarter procedures grew approximately 15%. First quarter system placements of 311 increased 4% from the 298 systems placed last year. The number of systems placed in conjunction with the trade-in of an older generation system declined by 18% from the first quarter of 2021. That decline was entirely driven by the US. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 6% compared to last year. Using a three-year CAGR, first quarter utilization grew 4%. During the quarter, the supply chain environment continued to be challenging and remains dynamic. In Q1, we continued to experience constraints in our ability to meet customer demand, and as a result, on-time delivery performance to our customers was lower than we have experienced so far during the pandemic. In Europe, recently, we have experienced some geographically limited delays in fulfilling orders for some da Vinci instruments and accessories. These delays were due to a combination of the global supply chain and logistics issues, including our freight forwarder's unanticipated shutdown of its computer system. While these constraints did not have a material impact to our Q1 financial results, risks associated with potential disruption to our manufacturing operations and our ability to supply certain products to our customers remain significant. During the quarter, we also experienced higher logistics costs and manufacturing inefficiencies that impacted our gross margin. US procedure growth of 16% over Q1 of 2021 reflected continued relative strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in the UK, reflecting in part the significant adverse impact of COVID in Q1 of 2021. Procedure growth in the UK also reflected strong early-stage growth in hysterectomy, colorectal and thoracic procedures. Procedure growth in Germany and Italy was also strong while procedure growth in France was adversely impacted by COVID-mitigation measures in the first part of the quarter. Overall procedure growth in Asia was solid with growth across a broad set of procedure categories. Q1 procedures in China and Korea were slightly lower than our expectations given the impact of the Omicron variant later in the quarter. Procedure growth in Japan was strong reflecting some recovery in urologic procedures and strong growth in rectal hysterectomy and thoracic, key procedures that were granted da Vinci reimbursement in April of 2020. The impact of the Delta variant in Q3 of last year and the impact of the Omicron variant in this past quarter highlight the continued risk of future COVID waves and the associate significant risks to the number of da Vinci procedures that maybe performed. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. As Gary indicated, during the quarter we experienced a softening in our US capital pipeline, which we expect to impact system placements in the near term. In the US, we placed 186 systems in the first quarter lower than 190 in Q1 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 28 systems associated with trade-in transactions, partially offset by increased placements to greenfield customers. The remaining installed base of SI systems in the US is approximately 268 systems. Outside the US, we placed 125 systems in the first quarter compared with 108 in the first quarter of 2021. Current core assistant placements included 78 into Europe, 19 into Japan and nine into China compared with 59 into Europe, eight into Japan and 23 into China in the first quarter of 2021. We placed 30 systems in the UK in Q1, driven in part by the timing of government budget cycles. We do not expect to place similar levels of systems in the remainder of 2022 in the UK. Capital performance in Japan was driven primarily by greenfield accounts and some existing customers adding capacity in anticipation of the eight additional procedure reimbursements taking effect on April 1. System placements in China were moderately impacted by longer logistics cycle times as a result of lockdowns in response to increased COVID cases. As of the end of Q1 2022, there were 55 systems remaining under the current quota in China, which may also be available to competitors that have received local regulatory clearance. Globally trade-in transactions represented 35% of placements in the quarter compared to 38% for the full year of 2021 and 48% for the full year 2020. Given the lower number of older-generation systems in the field, we expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021. Hospitals continue to experience financial and operational pressures as a result of staffing shortages, the supply chain environment and resulting inflation. Since the start of the pandemic in 2020, the impact of COVID has placed a significant burden on hospitals. The financial pressures our customers have faced have been partially mitigated by government funding, such as the approximately $178 billion of CARES Act and other relief made available to hospitals in the U.S. The rising interest rate environment increases debt servicing costs and may make access to new debt more challenging. To the extent that hospitals continue to face financial pressures, reductions in government funding and higher interest rates, hospital capital spending may be adversely impacted. In addition, as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressure. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total first quarter revenue was $1.49 billion, an increase of 15% from last year. Leasing represented 35% of Q1 placements, compared with 37% last year -- last quarter rather. The slightly lower first quarter lease mix primarily reflected the mix of customers who prefer to purchase systems. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. First quarter system average selling prices were $1.54 million higher than the $1.45 million last quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by a lower mix of bulk by transactions with large customers and a favorable product mix in particular a higher proportion of Xi dual system placements in the quarter. We recognized $16 million of lease buyout revenue in Q1, compared with $26 million last quarter, and $19 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,870 per procedure, compared with $1,940 per procedure in the fourth quarter of 2021, and down 4% from the $1,950 realized in the first quarter of last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q1 of 2021 associated with the launch of our extended use instruments program in the U.S. and Europe, and an unfavorable FX impact from the stronger U.S. dollar. The sequential decline primarily reflects lower stocking orders associated with lower system placements, hospital ordering patterns and a small unfavorable impact from FX. We placed 34 Ion systems in the quarter, as compared to 14 Ion placements in the first quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 163 systems of which 70 are under operating lease arrangements. First quarter Ion procedures of just over 3,900 are up over 4x compared to the first quarter of 2021. Seven of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, including three systems placed at customers in Korea. Our installed base of SP systems is now 106. First quarter SP procedures grew approximately 36% year-over-year with approximately 50% growth in transoral procedures small but high-value segment. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in market beyond the U.S. and Korea. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2022 was 69.8%, compared with 71.8% for the first quarter 2021 and 70.1% last quarter. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last quarter, primarily as a result of higher logistics costs and increased fixed costs relative to revenue, as we invest in our infrastructure and manufacturing capacity to serve our long-term needs. While net inventory grew approximately $66 million quarter-over-quarter, there are still a number of components and products that are below our targeted levels. Pro forma operating expenses increased 26% compared with the first quarter 2021. The increase in first quarter operating expenses from a year ago reflected an, increase in head count increased variable compensation and higher customer-facing costs customer training, travel costs and marketing programs. As of the end of Q1, we had just over 10,500 employees, an increase of 26% from the first quarter of 2021 or an increase of 20% on a three-year CAGR basis. Of the approximately 2,100 employees we have added over the last year approximately 900 are manufacturing employees. Capital expenditures in Q1 were $95 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities' footprint, increase manufacturing capacity and automation of certain production lines. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.3%, slightly above our expectations primarily due to certain discrete tax items. Our pro forma tax rate was above the 22.2% for 2021, primarily due to a previous change in U.S. tax law that became effective on January 1st 2022. Our first quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $413 million or $1.13 per share, compared with $427 million or $1.17 per share for the first quarter of 2021. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $366 million or $1 per share for the first quarter of 2022, compared with GAAP net income of $426 million or $1.17 per share for the first quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $8.4 billion, compared with $8.6 billion as of December 31st 2021. The sequential reduction in cash and investments in the first quarter primarily reflected share repurchases, capital expenditures and unrealized losses on interest-bearing investments classified as available for sale, partially offset by cash from operating activities and proceeds from employee stock plans. During the quarter we repurchased 398,000 shares, at an average price of $268 per share for a total expenditure of $107 million. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022.
Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Our overall first quarter 2022 procedure growth was 19% compared to 16% for the first quarter of 2021. The three-year compound annual growth rate was 15%, between the first quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2022 procedure growth benefited, by 140 basis points from one additional workday in the quarter. In the U.S., first quarter 2022 procedure growth was 16% year-over-year, compared to 14% for the first quarter of 2021 and 16% last quarter. On a three-year compound annual growth basis US procedure growth was 13%. In the US first quarter growth was again driven by growth in procedures within general surgery. Bariatrics cholecystectomy and hernia repair were the largest contributors to procedure growth while growth in forge and rectal recession were also strong contributors. Outside of the US first quarter procedure volume grew approximately 25% compared with 23% for the first quarter of 2021 and 28% last quarter. On a 3-year compound annual growth basis procedure growth was 20%. In Europe we experienced strong growth in the UK, Italy, and Germany, partially reflecting the disruption caused by COVID in the first quarter of 2021. In the UK, procedure growth was strong in general, surgery, and gynecology categories supported by early-stage growth in hysterectomy colorectal and thoracic procedures. Procedure growth in Germany and Italy was also driven by procedures outside of urology with growth driven by colorectal hysterectomy, and thoracic procedures. Capital placements were also strong in the UK with the placement of 30 systems, the highest number of systems placed in the UK in a single quarter, driven in part by government funding and the trade-ins of older-generation systems. In Japan, growth in general surgery gynecology and thoracic continued to be strong with robust growth specifically in benign hysterectomy, gastrectomy, and lobectomy. In addition urologic procedures specifically prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy both experienced solid double-digit growth reflecting a recovery when compared to the prior year which was constrained by COVID. In China and Korea, first quarter procedure growth was solid but slightly below expectations as we saw a resurgence in March of COVID infections regional lockdowns and hospitalizations which negatively impacted procedure volumes. In China, growth in urology was solid in particular with growth in prostatectomy nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy. We continue to see broad-based growth in general surgery thoracic and gynecology as well. As we enter the second quarter this year, we are seeing the negative impact on procedure volume as a result of continued regional lockdowns. Now, turning to Ion, our robotic-assisted and alumina platform focused today on minimally invasive lung biopsy procedures. First quarter 2022 Ion procedures totaled just over 3,900 in Q1 2022, an approximately 350% increase over the prior year and 34% over the prior quarter. Ion system placements were also strong ending Q1 2022 with 163 installed systems growing approximately 225% over the prior year. Now, turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. During the quarter, Dr. Peres Shaw along with colleagues from the Robert I. Grossman School of Medicine at New York University and in collaboration with Intuitive published a real-world body of evidence assessing open conversion rates during minimally invasive surgery using laparoscopic, thoracoscopic, or da Vinci robotic surgery across 10 common procedures for benign or malignant conditions. Utilizing the premier health care database, this study included over 275,000 adult patients who between January 2013 and September 2015 underwent a minimally invasive procedure including hysterectomy, sigmoidectomy, right colectomy, ventral or inguinal hernia repair, partial nephrectomy, lobectomy or low anterior resection. Overall, a 5% conversion to open rate for the MIS approach was observed across all procedures with a range of 1% to 24%. Converted-to-open patients were associated with a 1.8-day longer length of stay, 1.7 times greater risk of readmission within 30 days of the procedure and a significantly higher in-hospital or perioperative 30-day total cost, adding approximately $2,900 to the in-hospital cost and $3,400 to the total 30-day cost. The researchers also compared differences in conversions between the laparoscopic, thoracoscopic and da Vinci cohorts. After performing propensity score matching, conversion rates for da Vinci procedures were significantly lower than LAP or VATS across all procedures. The volume-weighted conversion rate for da Vinci was approximately 2.8%, corresponding to a total relative conversion reduction for all study procedures of 58.5%, compared to the laparoscopic or the thoracoscopic procedures. The researchers concluded in part "From the standpoint of population health or a hospital system, these high-level data indicated that a cumulative effect of conversions can be a significant burden. And that reduction of conversion has major benefits and leads to increased value for the patient, the hospital and society at large. The use of robotic-assisted surgery is associated with a significant decrease in the conversion rate for all 10 operations studied and a multidisciplinary robotic program, encompassing several specialties, could result in significantly decrease conversion rates, with an improved ability to deliver successful minimally invasive surgery to its patients." I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2022 procedure growth within a range of 11% to 15%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2022 procedure growth of 12% to 16%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of the range assumes ongoing COVID and staffing pressure at hospitals and assume some continued choppiness with COVID throughout the year. At the high end of the range, we assume COVID-19-related hospitalizations around the world decline throughout the remainder of 2022 and there are no additional significant impacts from further resurgences. As noted last quarter, the range does not reflect significant supply chain disruptions. The steep increase in infections and subsequent recovery in the quarter from the Omicron variant in the US and the trend in procedure volumes, we have seen exiting the quarter in China, highlight the risk to the number of procedures that may be performed. In the second quarter of 2022, our year-over-year procedure growth rate will likely be lower than recent quarters, as Q2 2021 results reflected a strong recovery in procedures as COVID began to subside. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2022 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69.5% and 70.5%. We are now slightly expanding the range of our pro forma, gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70.5% of net revenue. The lower end of the range was updated to reflect the impact on input costs related to supply chain inflation and some impact from a stronger US dollar. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 21% and 27%. We are refining our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 27%. We continue to expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $510 million and $550 million in 2022. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $50 million and $60 million in 2022. On last quarter's call, we forecast 2022 capital expenditures within a range of $700 million to $1 billion. We are now refining estimated capital expenditures for 2022 to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million, based primarily on the current timing of planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you.  And our first question is, sorry, from the line of Amit Hazan. Please, go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Thank you. Hey, good afternoon. Maybe, I'll ask my first question on your comments on the US systems side and the capital spending environment, would just love to have more color on that. And, obviously, we were focused on the same numbers that you mentioned, which is just the greenfield unit placements. And if we kind of look back, just as context of what we have is, just over the past four or five years, those tend to increase by about 10% a year and it is pretty choppy year-to-year. Just using that as a proxy, how much help can you give us on whether that's a good kind of target for this year for the non-trade-ins in the US? And then just color on what you're seeing here in the near, kind of, just immediate term that you mentioned. It sounded like a lot of risk factors. And I'm wondering if it's risk factors that you're citing or its something that you're actually seeing in your customers delaying planned purchases.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Let me take the second question first and then I'll ask Jamie to step in on a little bit more on the trade-in side. So what we're seeing now, where we're at is, a little bit less delay of planned purchases, a little bit less what we're signaling more around -- Q4 demand looks strong. Q1 in terms of the early parts of the pipeline process and some of the contracting, some of the later parts, we're seeing in the US just a little bit lower volume. It may clear itself. It may entirely be that, this was just a pull-forward of a little bit of demand and some budget flushing, as hospitals got ready for the retirement of some of the government support for COVID. But it's not clear. We don't know yet. We know for sure that we're getting toward the end of the SI trade-in cycle in the United States. So that will soften some of the US capital. The final point I'll -- and then there's forecasted additional pressures on hospitals and finances. The short answer to that is, we're going to have to see. We'll see if those come to fruition or not. So that's a little bit of where that lays out. With regard to kind of what does the trade-in ratio look like, let me turn it to you Jamie. 
Jamie Samath: Yes. If I just look back at last year 2021 there's about 500-ish trade-ins done globally. Of that about 80% were transactions in the US, so you can just kind of get a sense of the degree to which the US has driven the trade-in cycle. As I said in my prepared remarks as of the end of Q1 there's about 268 SIs left in the US in the installed base. And so you can kind of use those two data points to some estimate of how that will play out overtime.  As you start to get towards kind of the end of the tail of remaining SIs, that they probably last for a little longer than kind of the average when you're in the middle of the distribution. But that's what I'd say with respect to trade-ins. I think Amit you had a question on greenfields. The way I would think about it in the US is, you kind of have your procedure estimates that you can take from our range. You can apply the usual model with respect to utilization. That gives you some sense of how the installed base might expand. And so, you can kind of do that calculation. That obviously is a mix of greenfields and incrementals. And I would just reflect in that model then what is the potential risk from what we highlighted with respect to the softening US capital pipeline that we saw in Q1. 
Gary Guthart: Just a capping remark on that. Final thought is, the core driver in a mature multiport market segment in a country like the United States, the core driver is procedure demand. And we feel like procedure demand is healthy. It's healthy in our target areas. Our major focus is making sure that we can supply the customer with what they need in a way that's high quality and timely. So, it's really managing the supply chain. If that goes well and we are successful in closing those gaps, I think capital demand will work itself out. It will play through because it ultimately in those markets is driven by core procedure demand. 
Amit Hazan: Thanks for that color. And the second question I always hate to ask this question but I feel like investors want me to, at this point in time just get you to reflect on it. So we always believe as you stated that you're working on at least one, if not two new platforms. We know you have that in the background. We see your R&D spend. That's obvious to everyone. I think the big question is always about timing.  And for us what we wanted to ask is, is this a situation at this point in time where technology just need more time to incubate whether maybe what we're seeing is more something that's related to FDA in the process that you go through and how that's evolved? How much color can you give us on just the process for getting new technology to market and where you are?
Gary Guthart: Yes. It's a good question. The -- what I'd say here is a couple. One is, as the technologies have matured and the installed base has gotten bigger, we've made an intentional decision to invest a lot in upgrading the capabilities of Gen 4 platforms that are out there. So the first thing has been that the SI that somebody purchases today is more capable than the SI that they had in -- when it was first launched and we keep doing that.  In part that's easier those kind of incremental adds to platform architecture that's pretty mature are easier for the customer base to absorb. And they also compound utilization. They allow them to get more utility out of the capital they have. They get higher throughput through it and they do more procedures with it. And in Gen 4, we're not done with that. We have continued to do it and whether it's instruments and accessories or endoscopy or software.  And we have some things up our sleeves for that too. So that was intentional. We were doing more kind of structural changes early on in that product and we have intentionally moved some things into more incremental changes on Gen 4. We do think that there are bigger structural changes that will make sense. We are working on them. They are interesting. I think they have long-term implications for the surgical market segments we participated and I'm excited about them. Some of those things are around technology development. Some of them are around manufacturing and supply chain development and some of them are around clinical pathways and regulatory pathways. So all of those things play out. I will reinforce what you said. We work on incremental changes. We work on structural changes and we work kind of multiple generations ahead and that remains true. We continue to do that. Timing-wise, sometimes a little bit hard to predict perfectly based on both supply chain readiness, and how FDA thinks about those things. For us, I want to make sure that every time we make a step that the customers value it, that it's done with them in mind rather than with us in mind. And we continue to have that philosophy and we'll pursue it.
Amit Hazan: Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Hi, Gary. Maybe, we could talk about -- you could expand on your comments on Ion. Just a couple of things you said that I'd be curious to hear more about. Submitted for EU approval, maybe you could give us a little more color on the timing of the opportunity and I'm wondering whether it impacts 2022. But maybe you could also talk a little bit about what you've been kind enough to describe in the recent past as sort of an inflection point for Ion. Maybe broadly speaking, what's your early -- what's the feedback you're getting from how the device is using? And maybe talk a little bit about what's next. I mean, it seems more like an execution kind of story at this point.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Rick. On submission for Europe, the -- we just submitted our dossier. Europe has changed over their -- the framing of their medical device regulation. They call it, EU MDR. It's relatively new for the world. As a result, projecting exact timing to get those clearances is a little different relative to historical norms. We don't anticipate it completing in 2022. That's just -- it's a little bit of what's the odds game, but we think it's several quarters to finish, mostly because it's new for the regulators and it's new for us. On the point of how is Ion ongoing, it's being driven right now on the single indication of biopsy and bronchoscopy. I think it's driving well because it meets a need. I think alternate technologies manual and robotic are less capable. And we see a lot of peer-to-peer word of mouth that is driving interest and that's backed by data like the PRECIsE trial. So that's been helpful for us. A lot of our focus here has been developing our manufacturing capacity, continuously improving the product in terms of usability, quality, robustness and efficacy. And the teams are doing a great job and working extremely hard to do all of those things make sure that we can maintain supply and improve. I'm just delighted with what they're up to. They are both increasing capacity and improving robustness and quality simultaneously. So that's been wonderful, and I think we have room. We're seeing the combination of Ion bronchoscopic evaluation combined with robotic surgery thereafter sometimes people do it on the same day. And that has seen some real value for patients. It's not every part of the patient population, but there are some patients for whom that's a good solution. And we see a lot of excitement. So the tie-through of Ion diagnostics with follow-through treatment is creating patient value. It's shortening the time to definitive answers and then a surgery if a surgery is indicated. So that's been great. We think Ion as a platform has multiple future indications that it can provide clinical value that it can bring and we are pursuing them assertively in various places. We are not yet publicly describing what those things are in part because we have some technology to develop in part there's some regulatory pathways in and it's a competitive space. And so we're working down those elements. As we get a little closer have a little bit better visibility into which ones when then we'll be sure to share.
Rick Wise: Got you. Procedure demand, as you clearly stated it was healthy this quarter. It seems like it's – it feels like, it's likely to continue. So hopefully, as hopefully COVID headwinds settle back a little bit around the world. You – Intuitive always used to talk about the – let's see, if I can say this correctly Gary, the percentage of utilization for average utilization for da Vinci systems. And I'm sort of making this up from memory, but it used to be like when you got to 60% or 65% of procedure of da Vinci capacity, it would start to drive new discussions about new systems. Is it – forgetting the specifics of question where do you feel like you are with the current installed base utilization? And is that a consideration that we should reflect on as we think about system placements going forward?
Gary Guthart: There's absolutely a relationship between procedure growth and demand, and increased utilization on capital, right? And it's inversely related. If you have lower utilization, you sell more capital to do the same number of procedures. We have believed and have pursued assertively that while higher utilization decreases the number of systems that we sell, it increases the utility the economic value derived by our customers to get higher throughput. And so we put programs in both in terms of design and workflow, as well as consulting services to help them get higher utilization. We've been doing that for years. It's a number that, you can move in a sustained way but it's hard to move quickly. And I'll turn it over to Jamie shortly, who'll talk a little bit about what the trend line and utilization growth has been. But from an intent point of view, we are happy to see increased utilization, even if that pressures near-term capital because it creates better ROI conditions for our customers. And from a pure marginal economics point of view at Intuitive, the marginal economics work out well for us too. So it's a win-win even though at the top line in placements, it may look like pressure. So then you had asked the question kind of what is peak utilization, and how do you think about that. I'll also turn it over to Jamie. It has a lot to do with mix and operating conditions in the hospital. It's a little bit less a technology question, a little bit more how they use it. So Jamie, perhaps a little bit on utilization.
Jamie Samath: If I just go back to pre-COVID for a second Rick, if you look at 2019 average system utilization grew by 5% over 2018. If I look at recent times and use the CAGR approach to kind of normalize for COVID last year on a two-year CAGR basis in 2021 utilization grew by 4% this past quarter on a three-year CAGR basis. Again back to 2019 grew by 4%. So you can see some relative consistency there. With respect to looking forward, I think that there is some dependency on the institution the procedure mix within the institution. General surgery in combination with Xi gives you the opportunity to drive utilization differently than a different procedure mix particularly given the lower procedure times in some of the benign low-acuity procedures. But it also reflects the number of surgeons that are trained and the commitment of the possible to drive asset utilization. If you look at the distribution of utilization today it's relatively wide. I think there are a number of CFOs and hospitals that on a medium-term basis see opportunities to continue to drive utilization up and we are supportive of that. 
Rick Wise: Thank you so much.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one on China for me and one on inflation and supply constraint. So on China what have you guys seen so far from the lockdowns? And what are your expectations for the second quarter? Do you think you can still grow year-over-year in China? And related to that Gary what's the process and time line for the next quota? You're about to finish this quota. Is it possible the next quota could be larger or eliminated entirely? And I have one follow-up. 
Gary Guthart: I'll turn those both to Jamie. 
Jamie Samath: Yes. With respect to what we saw with -- in procedures in Q1 as you saw the COVID cases rises in places like Shanghai. And as the authorities locked down and they locked down pretty strictly, we saw procedures impacted in March. That's continued so far into April although it's obviously early. I think that there's risk in procedures in Q2 relative to what you would expect without COVID and those lockdowns. China is our second-biggest marketplace, but it's still a relatively small proportion of overall procedures. US is still about 70% of global procedures. But certainly the way things look right now you have some impact in Q2. What that ends up being really depends on how long the lockdowns last and how long COVID persists in China. I think a separate risk is kind of the impact of logistics and supply chains as we deliver product to China and from a more macro perspective just the port closures and the broader impact that we could see in China given the degree of exports they have just generally across the economy. With respect to the China quota difficult to predict. The last couple of times the quota has been issued in the third year of the quota period, which would be next year. We don't have great visibility into when that might be. And we don't have honestly great visibility into what the number would be. I don't think we are expecting or planning on a situation where we are exempt from a quota. But again we don't have great insights to how that will play out. 
Gary Guthart: In general, if the quota…
Larry Biegelsen: Yes.
Gary Guthart: If the quota, is responsive to demand we think demand is high and the question is how responsive to that demand is the central government quota when they do it. Sorry, Larry go ahead. 
Larry Biegelsen: No. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Thank you. Jamie on inflation and supply constraints, are you able to quantify the impact on the gross margin that you're expecting from inflation? And on supply constraints, how are you addressing this? A lot of companies are buying forward inventory. And what are your expectations for when it gets better? I know you've talked about hand-to-hand combat. You've used that phrase almost on the last few calls. So thanks for taking the questions.
Jamie Samath: Yes. I would just maybe ground the impact of inflation a couple of ways. If you look back at history, our gross margin has been in, let's say, the 71%-ish range versus what we just guided 69% to 70.5%. And there's really two drivers in the gap between our history and that range. One are the investments we're making in fixed costs in infrastructure and manufacturing capacity, that's being invested effectively for long-term need. So some of that is ahead of when we will need it. But the lead times require that we put that in place ahead of time. The second impact is this impact from the supply chain and inflation in the form of logistics costs, higher component prices, et cetera. I can't give you perfect kind of delineation between the two. I would say roughly slightly more of that the impact of that gap is on the fixed cost side. The remainder is in inflation supply chain impacts. With respect to how we're managing through the supply chain, there are significant efforts by our operations team just to respond to the whack-a-mole that you described. It's a constant battle of issue resolution. And our number one goal as Gary described is to ensure continuity of supply to customers. So that's where our efforts and focus is. As the supply chain environment rebalances in whatever point that is in the future, certainly, we will kind of refocus our operations teams to focus on cost reductions, getting our manufacturing efficiencies back to our targets. But that's going to really be a question of when will that be. On the inventory side, you saw us actually increase inventories. I referenced in my prepared remarks almost $70 million sequentially. The mix of that though is clearly not perfect. We're replenishing inventory where we can if and as supply lasts. But we have an imbalance currently. Certainly, if you look at the medium to long-term, we're going to look carefully at what levels of inventory we want to hold, as one risk mitigation. I think the other thing we'll look at is, how do we make ourselves less dependent on sole suppliers.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks, Jamie.
Gary Guthart : Just a tiny bit of color on that capping sentence, the current situation -- it's a little bit hard to predict the future, because there's enough moving parts that determining what or forecasting exactly how it will move is probably difficult at this moment. Currently, the number of parts that are under stress has decreased, but the intensity of the stress around a few parts has increased. So, the issue of -- the number of things that are a challenge is narrowing, but the ones that remain are more stubborn. And Jamie, your point of we use various tools whether it's buying ahead, buying safety stock, or redundancy and supply chain. We'll use any and all of those if we can to help mitigate the risk.
Larry Biegelsen: Thank you, Gary.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Drew Ranieri from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Drew Ranieri : Hi, Gary and Jamie. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, just for you. I mean, I think Intuitive has like 2,200 US hospital customers. That's more my guess than I think what you've ever laid out. But can you maybe talk about what it takes to get the remaining 4,000 hospitals really off the sidelines and using robotics? Just maybe how are you thinking about that in the US? I mean, do you necessarily have to go everywhere, or are there really, kind of, still opportunities to get into the high-volume surgery centers hospitals given some of the commentary about the trade-in cycle dynamics and your push for some higher utilization of the systems?
Gary Guthart: The -- I won't speak to the quantitative approach. And perhaps Jamie you have a perspective. But just to give you a little bit of a qualitative view, many of the hospitals out there that are greenfields, while they may not have one of our programs today are part of an integrated delivery network that somewhere in the system they have our products and knowledge. The way we work with that is collaboratively with IDN leadership. As they start to understand what the value of the programs are, they will start to move within their own system our products into locations they care about. And so we've seen a really nice move and collaborative expansion with our customer base into those spaces. Increasingly, we have conversations about moving into different sites of care, especially as benign -- general surgery procedures and some other procedures that are benign and often done in smaller ambulatory environments become more prevalent in our workspace we see that improving over time. So we think we can follow our customers where they want to go. There is the concentrating effect of robotics and capital investment. It is capital investment. When that happens it does concentrate regionally those patients and procedures into Centers of Excellence. We think that's good for our customer to get higher utilization. We think it's good for surgical outcomes because they get more practice. So I think it's a combination of the two. I don't think we just look at it and think we have to go to where every patient is today. We do think consolidation helps and works but it will expand from where it is in this moment. Jamie, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.
Jamie Samath: The only thing I would say is the remaining greenfields tend to be -- this is not always the case, but tend to be more in the rural setting, smaller number of beds. So what I think we've seen over the last three, four quarters as Gary described is actually increases in the number of placements of greenfield accounts. These are hospitals as Gary said that are within existing IDNs. And that's largely a function of the success and experience those IDNs have had with benign procedures particularly in general surgery, which tend to be a higher mix in these rural hospitals. And so they see the opportunity for effective robotics programs in that setting, whereas, before maybe there was more skepticism or the financial picture was more challenging. We'll do that carefully and in conjunction with our IDN partners and it has to be one that makes economic sense for us and for the customer. On the ASC side, we have a relatively small but growing installed base. Our procedure growth at ASCs in the US is accretive, but that's probably because the number of systems that we have at hospitals or ASCs is relatively low. Those ASCs generally are ASCs affiliated in some way with our IDNs. That gives us greater confidence in those accounts.
Gary Guthart: Drew, I'll give you a fast follow-up here at the end.
Drew Ranieri: All right. Thanks. Just on Japan, you talked about adding eight more procedures -- you're getting reimbursement for eight more procedures. Can you maybe just put that in context of how you expect that ramp to maybe look like versus the prior wave of reimbursed procedures in Japan? Thanks.
Brian King: Drew hi, this is Brian. I guess I would say, really the opportunity for adoption on those eight newly reimbursed procedures, it's a bit difficult I'd say, to estimate at this time, right? I mean, if you were to take procedures like colon resection, as an example, it's highly penetrated by lap today. So I think adoption of da Vinci will actually be dependent on, say, demonstrating clinical and economic benefits, which I think it's going to take some time. And I think it's going to take some time to develop our training and proctoring capabilities and really to establish key opinion leaders. So, I think it's just going to take some time. It's really hard to estimate how quickly da Vinci will adopt locally.
Gary Guthart: A little color on that. I think over the mid-term, we're really excited about it. Over the near term, it takes more. Thank you, Drew. That was our last question.
Gary Guthart: In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the Quadruple Aim: better more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately a lower total cost to treat. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly, so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months. This concludes the call.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-20 19:49:05) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Q4 2021 Earnings Release Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. . As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Brian King, Head of Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.
Brian King : Thank you. So good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2021, and Form 10-Q filed on October 20, 2021. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights; Jamie will provide a review of our financial results; and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our financial outlook for 2022. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. 2021 required agility as we drove through significant headwinds to support customers and manage our supply chain. Our teams performed well, helping customers return to surgery when COVID allowed them and maintaining the integrity of our supply chain and workforce. Given our recent press release updating procedures, capital placements and revenues, I'll be brief in describing our full year 2021 results and spend a little more time outlining our plans for 2022 and beyond. Putting 2021 in context, demand for our robotically-assisted interventions has been resilient during COVID. While these interventions get delayed during COVID peaks, they return as COVID wanes, and that is encouraging. Pandemic stresses on health care systems emphasize the need for the kind of high-quality, minimally invasive interventions or products enable. MIS procedures allow greater use of ambulatory surgery, free up resources and ORs relative to other approaches and often enable faster patient return to home and overall recovery. In 2021, da Vinci procedures grew 28% compared to full year 2020, reflecting a partial recovery in surgery after the first wave of the pandemic. Over the 2-year period, 2020 and 2021, the compound annual growth rate in procedures was 14%. Capital installs were healthy in 2021, with our team placing 1,347 da Vinci and 93 Ion systems in the year, driving da Vinci placement growth of 44% over 2020 and at a CAGR of 10% over the past 2 years. With a 2-year CAGR in procedures of 14% and installed base growth of 10% over the same period, utilization of installed systems continue to climb through the pandemic. We think this is good for our customers and good for us. Jamie will give regional capital trends and Brian will give detailed procedure dynamics later in the call. The past 2 years have stressed more than health systems. Our ability to attract, develop and retain outstanding staff remains a key focus for us. Our team has performed well, supporting our customers and each other. In the year, we added approximately 1,700 employees to our team with net headcount growth of approximately 180 in R&D, 920 in operations and 340 in our commercial force. Of the 1,700 net additions, 700 were outside of the United States. Looking out over the next decade, we believe that the method we have developed to identify clinical need, then design a technology-enabled ecosystem for improving the quadruple aim, then deliver and train customers on this ecosystem, can positively impact a broad set of minimally invasive interventions. The opportunity and challenge for Intuitive is to evolve our ecosystem to support our customers and ourselves at scale and to choose procedural opportunities and platform architectures that made sense. Turning to investments in the mid-term. Our priority for use of our capital is to reinvest in the business, to develop new opportunities that improve the quadruple aim and to strengthen our operating capabilities at global scale. We are focused on driving a vital set of initiatives, and I'd like to describe the dynamics for you in a little more detail. In multiport, we believe our Gen 4 architecture is outstanding and we've been adding capability to this product line since launch, including significant expansion and upgrades to energy and stapling product lines, improved endoscopic imaging, the introduction of da Vinci X, the introduction of Extended Use Instruments, training technologies and finally, the introduction of new and upgraded connectivity and data management tools. Given the precision, robustness and overall performance of our Generation 4 robotics architecture, we will continue to innovate on this platform, bringing additional value to those customers who have standardized on Generation 4 fleets. We are also investing in new core capabilities for our multiport systems, both Generation 4 and beyond that we'll describe as they get closer to market. You should expect continued innovation from us here. Turning to Ion. Our first indication addresses a large unmet need in lung cancer biopsy and our focus is fully enabling our production capability and customer ecosystem for this indication. There is strong demand for lung biopsy, and we are working to expand manufacturing capacity of all processes for greater quality and lower costs at scale and run trials and address regulatory requirements that enable global expansion. Over time, we plan for total Ion program profitability to approach that of our corporate average as we execute against our volume, design and process improvement goals. We are pursuing additional applications for Ion, and we'll describe them as we get closer to market. For our single-port system, da Vinci SP has the opportunity to change the standard of care in 2 different types of soft tissue surgery: those that require the extraction of tissue that can be done through a small single port and those procedures that benefit from narrow entry into the body as a whole. Where Ion, at its current stage of launch, has a single indication that represents a large patient population, SP's opportunity is the aggregation of several midsized indications. For example, SP used in Transoral Robotic Surgery is growing steadily in the U.S. To broaden SP's applicability in the U.S. and other markets, we are undertaking clinical trials to support regulatory review. We believe that SP will serve several additional surgical specialties, which will allow our customers and us to leverage capital investments in the program. Like Ion, we plan for SP platform profitability to approach that of historical platforms over time, and we're encouraged by recent progress. Our customer digital efforts now represent roughly 5% of our total operating expenses and drive the business in 4 ways. First, the use of data and digital tools by customers to analyze their operations helps improve outcomes, reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction and retention. Second, digital and internal investments can decrease our cost to serving our customer. Third, some of our digital tools generate revenue themselves and finally, use of data and analytics internally can help our teams make better decisions. Because digital and data tools span our platforms and are used externally and internally, we do not account for them using the same financial models as our platforms, nor do we break them out as stand-alone financial engines. That said, we do evaluate digital and data projects against internal strategic and return analysis. Over the past 5 years, the annual number of instruments we produce has grown roughly 200% and the annual number of systems we produce has more than doubled. The number of customer professionals trained annually has nearly doubled, and our engineering staff has nearly tripled. Our product volume growth has also allowed us to in-source some of our high-volume accessories while investing in automation. This has a threefold benefit: improving supply chain robustness, improving manufacturing quality and lowering unit costs. As our training, R&D and manufacturing efforts move to scale, we're investing in infrastructure, factory builds, training center expansion and automation. These infrastructure investments are lumpy, and our current growth cycle requires building capacity. These projects have been planned over the past couple of years and will start amortizing first moderately in 2022 and more substantially in 2023 and '24, then normalizing over the next few years. For example, over the next 4 years, we'll be growing and consolidating facilities for operations, R&D and customer training space in Atlanta; doubling our Mexicali manufacturing footprint; doubling our R&D design space and operations space as our California headquarters; and finally, consolidating and growing our commercial training operations and R&D space in Germany. In summary, we'll build on our Generation 4 capabilities in multiport while innovating in clinical utility for multiport surgery broadly. We'll continue to bring our flexible endoscopy platform Ion to scale and drive capacity, quality and cost improvements while seeking to broaden access to new markets. In SP, we expect to expand indications in regional markets while driving manufacturing quality and scale. We will invest in regional training, R&D and manufacturing centers globally to support the growth of the business and pursue opportunities for operating leverage given volume, some of which we'll share with customers to catalyze elastic markets. Finally, we will continue to advance our digital efforts to enable fast, accurate and actionable decisions with our customers and for our company. Lastly, for 2022, particularly, we're focused on the following: first, outstanding customer support in the face of continued pandemic disruption; second, execution of our robotic and digital platform expansion in pursuit of new indications and new markets; third, general surgery growth in the United States; and finally, diversified growth outside the U.S. beyond urology. As we turn to our financial report, I'd like to formally thank Marshall Mohr, our outgoing CFO and new Head of Global Business Services, for his outstanding stewardship over the past 15 years, and turn the time over to our incoming CFO, Jamie Samath, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. Reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2021 revenue and procedures are in line with our preliminary press release of January 12. Before I dive into our Q4 results, let me start with a summary of our full year 2021 performance. Given the significant impact of COVID, we believe it's appropriate to review our 2021 results on both a year-over-year and a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. Procedures increased by 28% as compared to 2020 and increased by approximately 14% using a 2-year CAGR. We placed 1,347 systems of customers during the year, an increase of 44% as compared to 2020 and up 10% using a 2-year CAGR. As a result of this procedure and system placement performance, 2021 revenue increased by 31% year-over-year and increased by 13% using a 2-year CAGR. Key business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows: fourth quarter procedures increased approximately 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 and increased approximately 13% using a 2-year CAGR. During the quarter, procedures continued to recover in October and November from the impact of the Delta variant in Q3. However, in December, procedures were adversely impacted by the increase in hospitalizations in the U.S. and parts of Europe as the Omicron variant spread rapidly. This trend has worsened so far into January. Fourth quarter system placements of 385 increased 18% from the 326 systems placed last year. As a result, net of trade-ins and retirements, we expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 12%. On a 2-year CAGR, our installed base is up 10%. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 7% compared to last year and increased approximately 3% using a 2-year CAGR. During the quarter, the supply chain environment became more challenging and remains highly dynamic. Our supply chain teams continue to work tirelessly with our supply chain partners to fulfill customer demand. In Q4, we experienced minor constraints in our ability to meet customer demand. For example, we had some limitations on supply of skill simulators. While these constraints were relatively minor and were immaterial to our overall Q4 financial results, they highlight the risk of potential significant disruption to our manufacturing operations due to the current supply chain challenges. U.S. procedures grew approximately 16% over Q4 of 2020 with relative strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. The December impact of the current wave of COVID on U.S. procedures varied by region, with a greater impact in the Northeast and Midwest. Benign procedures such as benign hysterectomy experienced a more significant impact in December, reflecting the deferrability of certain elective surgeries. In Europe, the impact on COVID on procedures in December was most notable in France and Italy. Despite the fact that hospitals are generally better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared to the outset of the pandemic, COVID-19 resurgences like those currently being experienced in the U.S. and parts of Europe have challenged hospital resources and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. In the U.S., high COVID-related hospitalization rates have been exacerbated by staffing shortages. According to data reported by the Department of Health and Human Services, the proportion of hospitals reporting a critical staffing shortage doubled between July and December. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions have and will also negatively impact da Vinci procedures. Q4 procedures in Asia were not significantly impacted by a resurgence in COVID, and we saw strong procedure growth across multiple specialties in China, Korea and Japan. While it is difficult to predict how long the current wave of COVID will last or the extent to which it will impact additional geographies, we expect that da Vinci procedures will be significantly adversely impacted in Q1. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Overall system placement results in Q4 were solid with U.S. placements of 235, up 20% from 196 in Q4 of 2020. System placements at greenfield customers were strong, up approximately 45% as compared to Q4 of 2020, driven by U.S. IDNs and new customers in OUS markets. Outside the U.S., we placed 150 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 130 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Current quarter system placements included 63 into Europe, 37 into Japan and 14 into China, compared with 54 into Europe, 22 into Japan and 13 into China in the fourth quarter of 2020. Capital strength in Japan was driven primarily by new customers in the private sector. As of the end of 2021, there were 63 systems remaining under the current quarter in China, which may be accessible to competitors should they receive local regulatory clearance. Globally, trade and transactions represented 30% of placements in the quarter, down from 40% last quarter and 49% for 2020. The remaining installed base of SI systems in the U.S. is approximately 343 systems. We expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID, including supply chain constraints and staffing shortages, are challenging and could impact hospital capital spending. In addition, as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressure. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: total fourth quarter revenue was $1.55 billion, an increase of 17% from last year. Leasing represented 37% of Q4 placements compared with 41% last quarter and flat to Q4 of 2020. The lower leasing mix in Q4 relative to last quarter reflected higher multisystem placements with a couple of IDNs who prefer to purchase systems. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will continue to increase over time. Fourth quarter system average selling prices were $1.45 million, similar to $1.43 million last year and lower than $1.57 million last quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by a higher mix of bulk buy transactions with large customers. We recognized $26 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $25 million last quarter and $14 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,940 per procedure compared with $1,900 per procedure in the third quarter of 2021 and down 6% from $2,060 realized in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q4 of 2020 and associated with the launch of our Extended Use Instruments program in the U.S. and Europe. The sequential increase primarily reflects continued growth of our advanced instrument portfolio. As we highlighted recently, revenue for our advanced instrument portfolio has grown over a 5-year period at a compound annual growth rate of 35%, and we are starting to see early and accelerating adoption in OUS markets. 10 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were SP systems, including 3 systems placed at customers in Korea. Our installed base of SP systems is now 99. During the quarter, we further developed our SP ecosystem, receiving 510(k) clearance for our Firefly Imaging Technology. We also received 510(k) clearance for enhancements to our SP instruments, including an extension of lives to 6 of our 8 instruments. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the U.S. and Korea. We placed 31 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 129 systems. Looking at the 93 Ion systems placed in 2021, 54% of those systems were placed under operating lease arrangements. For reference, the list price of our Ion system is $600,000 with ASPs generally a little below that level. As a reminder, Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. The entirety of our Ion installed base is with an existing da Vinci customers, the majority of which have large pulmonary and thoracic departments. Our Ion platform is also installed the majority of accounts that have an IP fellowship program. We continue to be encouraged by customer feedback and look forward to the completion of our next major milestone, the full results from the PRECIsE study, which is expected in the second half of 2022. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 70.1% compared with 69.7% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 71.3% last quarter. The fourth quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last quarter primarily as a result of manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics costs associated with the supply chain environment, lower system ASPs and a higher mix of systems revenue. Pro forma operating expenses increased 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2021 included a $30 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation compared with a $25 million contribution in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in fourth quarter operating expenses from a year ago reflected an increase in headcount, increased variable compensation and higher travel costs. We finished 2021 with almost 9,800 employees, an increase of 21% from the end of 2020. We believe the opportunity in robotic-assisted interventions to be significant and are planning to increase our investments significantly in 2022. We are at the early stages of our newer platforms, SP and Ion, and we will continue to invest in our digital and data capabilities. Brian will provide operating expense guidance later in this call. As Gary described, we are also investing in our infrastructure to support our growth objectives and facilitate our ability to scale. In 2022, we expect a significant increase in capital expenditures in the range of $700 million to $1 billion of capital investment for the year. A significant portion of this investment involves construction of facilities to provide incremental space for growth, to consolidate operations to enhance efficiency and to replace lease spaces with own spaces. These capital investments also expand our OUS footprint in support of opportunities for growth in key international markets, where da Vinci procedures are in earlier stages of adoption. These are multiyear investments. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.5% lower than our expectation, primarily due to a favorable U.S./OUS income mix. We expect that our pro forma tax rate will increase in 2022 and due to a previous change in U.S. tax law that became effective on January 1, 2022. Brian will provide details later in this call. Our fourth quarter 2021 pro forma net income was $477 million or $1.30 per share compared with $434 million or $1.19 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $381 million or $1.04 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of $365 million or $1.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and IP charges, acquisition-related items and legal settlements. We ended the year with cash and investments of $8.6 billion compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in cash in the fourth quarter primarily reflected cash generated from operations. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our outlook for 2022.
Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Overall procedure growth for the full year 2021 was approximately 28% as compared to 1% in 2020 and increased 14% using a 2-year compound annual growth rate. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 27% growth in the U.S. and 32% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., fourth quarter growth was driven by growth in procedures within general surgery. Bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair were the largest contributors to procedure growth within the quarter. Fourth quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 28% compared with 11% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 30% last quarter. In 2021, we non-urology specialties approached half of all OUS procedures and grew faster than urologic procedures. More specifically, at a region and country level, in China, Q4 procedures also had broad-based growth in urology, thoracic, general surgery and gynecology. General surgery, thoracic and gynecology procedures grew faster than urology and combined, made up more than total urology procedures in the fourth quarter. In Japan, da Vinci prostatectomy has emerged as standard of care for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer. We've also gained significant market share in other urologic procedures, including partial nephrectomy and cystectomy. The robust growth that we continue to see in Japan is now attributable to growth in general surgery, thoracic and gynecology procedures that were granted reimbursement status subsequent to urologic procedures. In Europe, procedure performance varied by country, but in procedures outside of urology, growth was driven by colorectal, hysterectomy for cancer and thoracic procedures. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. I'll highlight 2 recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. During the quarter, researchers from the University Hospital of Southern Jutland and the University of Southern Denmark published results from a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the short-term outcomes of robotic-assisted and laparoscopic colon surgery for patients with cancer. This analysis included 20 studies from 2005 to 2020, describing comparing outcomes from over 13,000 subjects with over 1,500 robotic-assisted procedures and over 12,000 laparoscopic procedures. Between the 2 groups, a significant difference favoring the robotic-assisted approach demonstrated a 46% lower risk of anastomotic leakage -- sorry, in addition, robotic-assisted colon surgery showed a 69% lower risk of conversion to open when compared to the laparoscopic approach, while also demonstrating a 15% reduction in the overall complication rate favoring the robotic-assisted approach and a 7-hour reduction in time to regular diet. Interestingly, a subgroup analysis was performed analyzing right-sided hemicolectomies, noting the prevalence of this procedure in the studies analyzed. And with over 850 subjects in the robotic-assisted group and over 3,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group, the robotic-assisted approach was similarly favored with regards to anastomotic leakage, rate of conversion to open and the length of stay. The authors concluded in part, "Robotic-assisted colon surgery showed advantages in colon cancer surgery regarding surgical efficacy and morbidity compared to laparoscopic colon surgery." In November of last year, Christopher Seder from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, published propensity adjusted analysis comparing robotic-assisted and thoracoscopic anatomic lung resection in obese patients. Leveraging data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons general thoracic database, Epithor, a French national database and McMaster University thoracic surgical database, over 8,000 subjects were identified for analysis with over 2,100 robotic-assisted subjects and over 5,900 VATS subjects included. After propensity score adjustments of the populations, the VATS patient showed a 15% rate of conversion to open compared to only 3% in the robotic cohort, which corresponded to risk of conversion 5x higher for the VATS approach. In addition, the robotic-assisted group demonstrated a shorter mean length of stay of approximately 0.7 days, 1% lower risk of respiratory failure and were more likely to be to start home after the procedure. Of note, this analysis is the first propensity-adjusted analysis comparing VATS and robotic-assisted anatomic lung resection in obese patients as well as the first to pull contemporary international patient level data. The authors concluded in part, "Overall, these data suggest that obese patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer undergoing minimally invasive anatomic lung resection with VATS, have a higher rate of conversion to thoracotomy when compared to patients undergoing anatomic loan resection with robotic-assisted surgery." I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement earlier this month, total 2021 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 28% year-over-year and 14% at a 2-year compound annual growth rate to roughly 1,594,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2022, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 11% to 15%. This range reflects the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of this range assumes ongoing COVID pressure and hospital staffing shortages, while the high end assumes no significant new surges after the current wave. In addition, this range does not contemplate any material supply chain disruptions throughout the year. We expect 2022 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedure growth in OUS markets where we are at earlier stages of adoption. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2022 as we have experienced in previous years prior to COVID, with Q1 being seasonally -- the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. We expect Omicron to have a significant adverse impact on procedures in the first quarter. With respect to revenue, as we have mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure demand, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales can vary substantially from period-to-period based upon many factors, including U.S. health care policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Within this framework, we'd expect 2022 capital placement seasonality to generally follow historical patterns by quarter, but could also be impacted by hospital staff shortages and the allocation of resources to managing current care. During Q3 and Q4, 40% and 30%, respectively, of systems placements involve trade-ins of older systems to our da Vinci Xi. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021. Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2021 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.2%. In 2022, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69.5% and 70.5% of net revenue. The slightly lower gross profit margin anticipated in 2022 reflects higher fixed costs from investments to drive growth of the business, strengthen our operating capabilities and also reflects the impact of higher supply chain costs. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses. In 2021, our pro forma operating expenses grew 19%. In 2022, we expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 21% and 27%. The operating expense growth reflects increased investment in R&D for our new product platforms, expanding OUS capabilities and the return of other spending that was previously restricted by COVID. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $510 million to $550 million in 2022 compared to $452 million in 2021. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $45 million and $55 million in 2022. With regard to income tax, in 2021, our pro forma income tax rate was 22.2%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income, with the increase primarily due to a change in U.S. tax treatment of certain expenditures that was enacted in 2017, but became effective on January 1, 2022. Lastly, we'd like to highlight that our Annual Sustainability Report will be available after this call on our Investor Relations website. In the latest report, we provide an overview of the current state of our sustainability strategy, areas of focus, key actions taken over the past year to develop sustainable solutions that meet our customer needs in new ways and our results achieved to date. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: . Our first question is going to come from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
Larry Biegelsen: Two questions for me. Gary, I wanted to start with a high-level question. You started using the slogan at the point of possibility recently, and you've talked about being at the point of possibility to build what's needed next. Can you talk about why you started using this new slogan? And what are the needs you're trying to address? And I had one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: No. I think we have -- thanks, Larry. I think we have a broad opportunity as a company here to take the methods that we have designed around identifying clinical need, doing the design and development of tech-enabled ecosystems to address that need and then working with customers to deliver it and train it. And there's, I think, long term, a lot of opportunity. As we look out there is substantial opportunity in existing markets and in new ones to do better for the quad aim. Doing this set, getting that set of ecosystem investments ready is heavy work. It's a multiyear effort. But we think we've shown that it can be done. And I think that's really what we're talking about here is the ability to start to impact other opportunities in international markets as we go forward. And Ion is such an example.
Larry Biegelsen: And it seems like so far, you've mitigated potential supply constraints well. How are you trying to mitigate them going forward? And would you describe the situation is getting better or worse? And how concerned are you about that?
Gary Guthart: Yes. Kind of -- I'll take the top and then I'll let Jamie take some more. At the very top part, it's kind of 3 big buckets. One of them is specific products themselves, semiconductors come to mind. The second bucket is some raw material constraints and the kinds of things we build. And the third is just logistics and motion of materials. Jamie, I'll let you fill in that perspective.
Jamie Samath: Larry, so I think we said in our prepared remarks, we saw the supply chain environment actually get worse in Q4, and we highlighted that we actually had some, as I call it, minor constraints in our ability to fulfill customer demand. You have a set of metrics there in the supply chain. One example we've given is on-time delivery from our suppliers was worse in Q4 as compared to Q3. As you look forward, I'd say that at this point, visibility is still not great, kind of the best that we have is the Q1 will be similar to Q4, but I think we have to see -- wait and see what the impact of Omicron might be on our suppliers and just broadly. So I think we're continuing to navigate through it. As I said, our supply chain teams are really still in hand-to-hand combat every day working with our partners.
Operator: Our next question now will come from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. 
Tycho Peterson: Gary, you talked about being at the end of the replacement cycle for a little while now. And obviously, you're retiring the S models. I'm curious how we should interpret that comment about being near the end of the replacement cycle. And as we think about maybe where you could be headed from an innovation standpoint, is it all about kind of driving down the line of procedures, making procedures easier with less training and expanding into newer indications? Or maybe just I'm curious from a technology standpoint, if you could talk a little bit about at a high level where you're headed?
Gary Guthart: Yes. Let's talk for a moment about replacement cycles. I think you're referring to the SI, Jamie had mentioned it in his prepared remarks, and Brian had touched on it. I think they were pretty clear, and I won't go through that. I do think that from a business model point of view, we don't think that we need to drive capital upgrades on Intuitive's calendar to have a healthy business. What we look at is where can we drive the quadruple aim and how can we effectively do that for our customers. And in that setting, we have been investing in our Gen 4 platform and expansion, I talked about that in my prepared remarks as well. And it's been great for the customers and for us. That's not the only thing we'll do, but it's an important thing that we do. You had mentioned a little bit on the technology stack, what are the kinds of things we care about. And a lot of what we were driven by are what kinds of things can we do inside the body, in imaging, in informatics that will dramatically change outcomes or the experience of the patients or the care team. And that has -- you can see that in the kinds of things that we've brought to market. We have fantastic teams. We have things that we're working on that we have not yet discussed that we think will drive differences in outcomes. So it's not just working on new indications or just working on ease of use. I think those things are both important, but it's not limited to that. There are other things that are going on that we think can change the nature of our interaction with tissue and drive outcomes again and raise the bar there once more. Jamie, anything you'd want to add on the issue of SR replacement cycle?
Jamie Samath: I would just maybe give you some numbers. In 2021, globally, we did about 510 trade-ins. About 80%-ish of those were in the U.S. U.S. has been driving those trade-ins. And so then if you compare that to the remaining installed base of 343, it's why we provided the commentary that we expect overall trading volume in '22 to be significantly lower than '21 just because the remaining store base is being depleted.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And speaking of innovation, can you touch on some of the SP enhancements? You talked about 510 clearance for extension of life for some of the instruments. Can you just clarify exactly what you got through?
Jamie Samath: Yes. So we've received, obviously, customer feedback along the way since we launched SP and some of our customers have asked for greater ability to do extraction. That's really around the range of motion within the anatomy of our instruments that do extraction and grip strength. As you grasp tissue, we've had customer feedback that we could improve the grip strength. And so along with the extension of lives, we responded to customer feedback and improve the instruments accordingly, as described.
Gary Guthart: We've done some other things, too. We have, as you know, dual console that helps with training of new surgeons and teaching environments. We extended the dual console capability into the SP space. Recently, we've launched and then upgraded some of the accessories that go with SP. So part of the process, for those of you who've been with us for a while, is continuous innovation that these things don't end where they start, and that's been true for SP.
Tycho Peterson: Great. One last one, just on the headcount. You started to call off highlighting all the additions last year. Should we think about a kind of similar magnitude of increase in '22?
Jamie Samath: I think if you look at the OpEx increase range that Brian provided, I think you can kind of draw a correlation between how headcount has kind of correlated to spending increase and I think that's a relevant starting point for '22.
Gary Guthart: We also gave you a mix in the script of kind of where they're headed, how much is R&D, how much is operations, commercial, and that's not a bad guide either as to kind of where the mix is going.
Operator: Our next question then will come from the line of Amit Hazan from Goldman Sachs.
Amit Hazan: I'll start with a shorter-term one, and then a longer-term one for Gary. Shorter term, just on the first quarter, just realizing the moving parts and it's fluid inside of the quarter. But how much help can you give us as to what you've seen so far? How do we model procedures in this environment? You said severely impacted, but we got to -- we have to put a number out there. So I'm curious, how much help you can give us for where the procedures are down at the moment or how much they're down, that would be terrific. And then also, on capital. If you're seeing anything quite yet in terms of delays in capital spending because of everything going on at hospital level and how we should think about '22 for capital spending relative to last year, what you feel the environment is like?
Jamie Samath: I mean I'll give you a couple of data points. So the greatest correlation we've seen historically on procedures is rates of hospitalizations. I believe that currently, U.S. hospitalizations related to COVID are beyond any of the previous ways. So I think you can kind of track how that has progressed so far and what some of the third parties are projecting for the remainder of the quarter. There's some modeling benefit to doing that. What I would point to is if you look at pre-COVID, so 2017, '18, '19, those -- the sequential change between Q4 and Q1 was about even, meaning it was about the same Q1 as Q4. So that's in a normal quarter. Most of the current wave will be in Q1. The impact of Omicron in Q4 was kind of later in the quarter. So I kind of start with a normal quarter would be flat sequentially and then model the rest of Q1 based on just hospitalization rates. With respect to capital, there's nothing at this point that we would call out. I do think that the combination of what's happening right now with COVID, along with staffing shortages, along with the extent to which the supply chain environment broadly could impact hospitals could make it challenging for hospital capital spending. They may manage that more carefully in such an environment. But there's nothing specific that we would call out at this point. What was the third part of your question, Amit?
Amit Hazan: No, that was actually -- I just have a longer-term one for Gary on, just given some of your comments that you made, it just kind of brings up in my mind just to ask you about what your thoughts generally are about a SaaS-type model and more specifically, the SimNow. We've talked to some of your customers over the past year or so. And it seems like some of them are being charged for SimNow software is somewhere around $20,000 a year in the service line. And so I wanted to see how you would frame that specific opportunity inside of kind of thinking about it with your installed base? And then more broadly and more importantly, just to see -- if you could just talk to this kind of SaaS type of model and whether you'll -- we'll be seeing more of these types of offerings from you in the future?
Gary Guthart: Sure. On the issue of kind of recurring revenue or service models versus kind of capital single charge, we have taken a posture of being really flexible with what our customer wants. There are some really nice things about as the transition -- as the company has transitioned to a recurring model that customers can come to choose when they're ready to engage us and it doesn't require large upfront capital expenditures. For some things that are inherently services and if you think about simulation, it's not really about the hardware in the case of simulation. It's really about access to modules and modules that improve over time and modules that get built to be specific to competency-based training. Subscriptions make a lot of sense because you're not really trying to sell a piece of hardware, you're really helping them develop a training program over time. So we think increasingly, as our business in software and analytics and some of the digital tools that we're bringing come up, then subscriptions may make sense. And to the extent that they align with customers, we're happy to do it. I also like the idea of recurring revenue in that it focuses the organization on earning the customer's business every day that it's a lot less lumpy for them and it's a lot less lumpy for us. And if we're bringing value and helping them achieve their quadruple aim goals, then they're happy to stay with us in those events. So I would expect that the recurring revenue portion of our business keeps creeping up as a percentage of total revenue over time. So long as customers are aligned to that, that, that makes sense from their finances point of view, then that's what we'll pursue. And to the extent that they're interested in other models, then we are open-minded.
Operator: Our next question now comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel.
Rick Wise: Gary, I thought I'd follow up on a couple of things. You highlighted very specifically for both Ion and da Vinci SP this concept of margins aren't where they will be. And over time, you're going to bring the business to scale. I was wondering if you could expand on that, maybe give us a flavor for where margins are now? And how do we think about is this 2 years away? Is it 5 years away? How do we think about the trajectory going forward there?
Gary Guthart: Thanks for the question. On the -- kind of where we're headed, we look at those architectures. And we think based on our experiences, understanding our supply chains, understanding what iterations and engineering and manufacturing look like that both of those platforms should be able to hit historical norms in the future years, and not forever in future years. That said, in the early innings here, you're at lower volumes relative to where you're going to be. You're also working through some manufacturing process improvements and doing some of the capital investments that you need to do in order to get unit cost down. I'll look to Jamie in terms of characterizing kind of roughly where they are. SP is a little more mature product line in our hands in terms of manufacturing and our GM and her team over there doing a really nice job identifying those opportunities and sequentially knocking them down over time, feels really good. It's a little earlier, and it's going through a little bit different growth ramp and so it's going to have to work its way down that process. Although we also feel good about kind of the core architectures that would give us some confidence that we can hit those objectives. Jamie, anything that you would want to add?
Jamie Samath: Rick, I would split the question kind of into 2 categories. There's gross margin and then there's, let's call it, the equivalent of operating margin. On a gross margin basis, kind of the actions that we have to take to get both Ion and SP to kind of, let's call it, target gross margins are well understood and it's really about execution over a period of time, a component of that will obviously be building scale. But I think those actions are well defined. They're a multiple-year effort.  On the operating margin side, it's really, what's revenue in relation to the amounts that we're investing. And that's obviously going to be a function of, in the case of Ion, how we adopt in lung cancer biopsy over time. And with SP, it's the additional indications and new geographies in terms of clearances. I don't have a scale for when we might reach those corporate average margins. I would say, though, for '22, given that SP and Ion are newer products, the gross margins there are dilutive as you'd expect.
Rick Wise : Yes. And just a follow-up for me. I mean it's clear you highlighted multi -- multiple ways that Asia from well this quarter, if I understood you correctly, procedures, I think you said were robust. And I'm just thinking about that thought in conjunction with your comments about where you're investing. And it sounds like a lot of the investments were in Asia. And I was just wondering if we should just -- how do I ask this? Does this suggest that you're thinking as we look over the next 3 to 5 years that there's more growth or more growth opportunity for Intuitive in the Asia Pacific region? Or how do we -- how do I think about those 2 facts and those initiatives, if that makes any sense? 
Gary Guthart: I'd characterize it a little bit differently, Rick. The starting point on Asia, it is clearly an interesting market, country by country. We are making investments in Asia. I don't think I'd say that they are the dominant investments, but they're substantial because we think there's substantial opportunity there to make a difference in those markets. So it's a leg of growth, but not the only one. There are opportunities for us in other regions, whether it's Europe or elsewhere. There are also opportunities for us in other clinical indications and some of the clinical trial work we're doing as well as the expansion of platforms and other technologies that we're working on. So I'd characterize it as one of the legs, not necessarily the dominant leg. Jamie, anything you would like to add?
Jamie Samath: I would just say both regions are attractive to us. It's fair to say that at least in the last couple of years, Asia procedure growth has been a little ahead of Europe. But on a strategic view, both of those regions are attractive, and we're investing accordingly. 
Operator: Our next question now comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS.
Matthew Taylor: So I wanted to ask one on innovation and one on competition. So on innovation, I appreciate some of the color that you gave on multiport. And I guess I've also noticed that you've, on your website, you've been hiring a lot of folks in kind of these endoluminal roles and looking at roles around things like node surgery. Could you talk about some of your investments there? Is there anything beyond what you're doing with SP and Ion that we should look out for? And overall, are there any bigger launches that we should expect this year, even if you're not going to tell them what they are, could you characterize what the cadence could look like of any kind of system upgrades or launches?
Gary Guthart: Yes. On the -- with regard to kind of forecasting future launches, of course, we won't give you any detail here. We'll launch them when we're ready to launch. In terms of the framing of your question, we are routinely developing applications for the platforms we have, whether it's bariatric, thoracic surgery in our multiport indications to new indications in SP and we're doing some trials in thoracic surgery and colorectal to new opportunities and flexible robotics and Ion.  And other platform investments that are currently not disclosed, the things that we're working on. So we're going to continue to do that. And some of them will come to fruition and be fantastic. And some of them may be things that we assess and then pivot as we learn more. So there's all of those things going on. And somebody was out scanning what we're hiring and scanning the kinds of patent applications we have, you'll see a great diversity of things we're interested. And it's a little bit like the first question on the call, when we say what are we talking about in terms of possibility. We really scour the acute intervention opportunity from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head and everything in between and start asking questions about whether we think there's a real opportunity for improvements in the quad aim and whether we could design a tech-enabled ecosystem to do something about it. And that's what informs a lot of that hiring. Some of it is near term and existing platforms. And some of it is future-oriented on platforms that may come to pass. So that's kind of how we think about it.
Matthew Taylor: Okay. And maybe just one on competition.
Gary Guthart: Matt, we'll give you one follow-up.
Matthew Taylor: Okay. Just on competition, you mentioned there's a potential for that to prolong selling cycle. It certainly doesn't seem like you're seeing any of that so far. Could you characterize whether there's been any change in the competitive environment to date versus a few quarters ago?
Jamie Samath: Certainly, you can see the competition is active at accounts. I think we've characterized that mostly as kind of reciprocal arrangements with respect to training center investments or reciprocal research investments. I don't think we call out any specific significant impact yet on selling cycles. But certainly, you can see the potential for over time.
Gary Guthart: All right. Well, thank you all. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation for using AT&T Event Services. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-19 20:51:06) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Q3 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will have a question-and-answer session and instructions for queuing up will be provided for you at that time.   And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Senior Vice President of Finance, Jamie Samath. Please go ahead, sir.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive’s third quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our CEO, Marshall Mohr, our CFO, and Brian King, our Treasurer. Before we begin, I would like to let you know that Philip Kim, our Head of Investor Relations for the last couple of years, has moved onto pursue his next opportunity. We appreciate his contributions and wish him well in his next endeavor.  Joining us on the call today is Brian King, who has been our Treasurer for the last seven years. Brian will be expanding his responsibilities to include the role of Head of Investor Relations. Moving on, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call maybe deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties.  These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10th, 2021, and Form 10-Q filed on July 21st, 2021. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC’s website.  Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the latest events section under our Investor Relations page.  Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question and answer session.  Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our financial results, I will discuss procedure, and clinical highlights, and provide an update of our financial outlook, and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our team performed well in the third quarter in the face of pandemic-related headwinds. The rise of the Delta variant and stresses in some hospitals pressured the demand for surgery. Global supply chain disruption has yet to abate, necessitating redirection of internal resources to continue to meet our customers demand.  Despite these challenges, growth in the use of our products continued in the quarter and capital demand remained robust. Our new platforms advanced in their commercialization, in their innovation, and in their clinical programs. Turning first to procedures, the increased COVID burden tempered the recovery we saw in the second quarter, particularly in the month of August.  The impact of the Delta variant drove procedures in the United States below our expectations at the start of the quarter with run rate stabilizing the last couple of weeks of September. Adoption continues in the United States, driven particularly by benign general surgery procedures including bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy, and hernia repair.  A trend in malignant procedures remains solid, including prostatectomy, hysterectomy, lobectomy, and colon resection. Two trends that have emerged over the past few years are the increased use of da Vinci in benign procedures, and rising use of our advanced instrumentation and targeted procedures.  Both are the result of focusing on our customers’ needs and delivering product and economic solutions to match. Outside the United States, procedure performance varied as a function of regional pandemic impact. In China, growths in the quarter were strong and span multiple specialties reflecting continued adoption.  In Japan and Korea, our procedure business remains healthy, with slight sequential procedure growth Q2 to Q3, despite COVID -related surgery disruption. Germany, the UK and France had reasonable year-over-year procedure growth and our customers are having success in diversifying procedure categories beyond urology.  Regarding the capital environment, new system placements continued to be robust. The United States had an outstanding capital quarter with a balanced mix of hospitals new to da Vinci, as well as healthy incremental placements for existing customers, and trade-ins of older technology.  This performance has been driven by collaboration with U.S. integrated delivery networks, as they thoughtfully manage and expand the capacity of their da Vinci fleets. Elsewhere, China, Japan, and Europe had solid placements in the quarter, and our placements in Brazil showed strength. Turning to our newer platforms. Our single-port system da Vinci SP had a solid quarter as we pursue additional indications. Placements of our flexible bronchoscopy platform Ion grew nicely sequentially in Q2 to Q3, powered by continued strong customer experiences in the field. Our finances were strong again this quarter though they followed an unusual path.  System strength and favorable system sales mix drove strong system revenue. Procedures grew at the low end of our expectations as a result of the Delta variant. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure moved down modestly as benign procedures continued to make up more of the procedure mix and our extended-use instrument program reaches equilibrium in the field.  Our spending grew sequentially and year-over-year as we continue to invest in expanding our new platforms and digital programs, as well as builds our go-to-market capabilities globally. Our expense growth was again modestly lower than planned, driven by some increase in time to fill open positions in a tight labor market, lower travel-related spending given the pandemic, and some under-spending in prototypes.  We will continue to invest in programs that fulfill the mission and build the Company. Turning to our innovation efforts, we developed and deployed technology-enabled solutions to support our customer’s pursuit with the : better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. I would like to take a moment to overview the clinical status of our programs.  For our da Vinci system, there are now over 9.7 million lifetime procedures performed with over 28,000 peer-reviewed clinical publications. Da Vinci X and XI now have over 70 representative clinical usages allowing broad use across multiple clinical specialties from urology to gynecology, thoracic surgery, general surgery, and trends oral surgery. Tens of thousands of surgeons routinely use our multi-port systems.  We continue to invest in our multi-port products, instruments, and services to further expand our capabilities and indications. Many surgeons continue to work with us to pursue new learning with several prospective studies ongoing. Our flexible bronchoscopy system, Ion, continues to build momentum clinically and commercially, with several presentations and manuscripts updating Ion clinical progress at the 2021 CHEST conference this weekend.  As described in yesterday's press release, early clinical trial results point to outstanding capability allowing for definitive diagnosis of harder to reach body regions. Our teams are hard at work building our manufacturing and supply capabilities to meet rising demand. Our single-port system SP has a clinical database of 28 peer-reviewed clinical publications.  There are currently several ongoing prospective studies for SP in Korea and the United States, including our IDE trial for colorectal indications. This quarter, we received FDA approval of our unit portal thoracic IDE. Broad SP adoption will be paced by additional regional and clinical clearances, which remain our focus for the SP program.  Our digital solutions provide data-driven insights to surgeons, operative services and hospital administration. For virtual reality training to efficiency insights, to custom comparative outcomes analysis, these tools are now routinely employed by our customers and our teams to improve programs. Our analytics program supported thousands of customers in the quarter.  Turning to machine learning, our teams are at the leading edge of  -based clinical science for surgery through our collaborations with leading academic centers, informing algorithmic and scientific discovery. Taken together, these programs allow our customers to quantify our collective impact on the quadrupling quarter .  Before turning the time over to Marshall, today we announced some changes in responsibilities of our senior executive team. These changes are the result of a structured process over the past few years, and they are driven by our need to support growth in our product lines, commercial reach, operations capabilities and business infrastructure, as we scale to meet the global opportunity to advance minimum invasive care.  Starting January 1st, 2022, our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Dave Rosa, will take on an important new role of Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, leading our efforts to identify and realize long-term business opportunities, continuing to build the value of our integrated product offerings, and ensuring our customers clearly understand the value of our ecosystem in creating successful, minimally-invasive programs.  Henry Charlton, currently General Manager of the U.S. and Europe, will succeed Dave as Chief Commercial Officer overseeing global commercial sales, regional marketing, and commercial enablement. Also, Marshall Mohr will take on an important new position as Executive Vice President Global Business Services, bidding Intuitive 's continued growth in information technology, and our enterprise process, data and systems, and global facilities.  Jamie Samath, we will succeed Marshall as Chief Financial Officer. They are each outstanding proven leader and will report to me. We expect them to spearhead our efforts to achieve our mission and continue to position Intuitive as first choice of our customers in a growing marketplace. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through our financial highlights in greater detail.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I want to describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance, later in my prepared remarks. Reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP result is posted on our website.  The information in our earnings release and within our prepared remarks reflects the 3-for-1 stock split completed earlier in October. Overall, third quarter procedures grew 20% year-over-year and reflect the impact of Delta variant resurgence. COVID also impacted third quarter 2020 procedures, making year-over-year comparisons complicated.  In the U.S., procedures grew 16%, reflecting the impact that COVID resurgence had on hospital resources regionally, the impact of the resurgence was most pronounced in August and early September, and regionally in the south and southeast. Later in the quarter, as COVID cases began to slow, procedures began to recover.  However, it is difficult to estimate the extent to which this resurgence or future resurgences will impact da Vinci procedures. Year-over-year, OUS procedures grew 30% with the impact of COVID varying regionally. In Europe, COVID had a greater impact in Italy and France, and less in UK and Germany.  While there continued to be COVID hotspots within some of our Asia-Pacific markets, overall procedures in the region performed well. China growth in the third quarter continued to be far higher than other regions, primarily reflecting system installation growth over the past year. Relative to the beginning of the pandemic, many hospitals are able to better manage increased COVID patient hospitalization.  However, staffing shortages and hospital supply chain issues are challenging some hospital capacities and could impact deferrable procedures, including da Vinci procedures, going forward. Jamie will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Key business metrics for the third quarter were as follows.  Third quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 20% compared with third quarter 2020 and decreased approximately 3% compared to the last quarter. Compound annual growth between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 13.5%. Third quarter system placements of 336 systems increased 72% compared with 195 systems for the third quarter of 2020, and increased 2% compared with 328 systems last quarter.  We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 11% to approximately 6,525 systems. This growth rate compares with 8% last year and 10% last quarter. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 9% compared with last year, and decreased 6% compared with last quarter.  Compounded annual utilization growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 3%. Moving on to capital placements, system placements in the quarter reflected a continued trend of IDN multi-system purchases and were driven by procedure growth and hospitals upgrading in order to access our standardized and fourth-generation capabilities.  Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets, to the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases. The trading cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline over time.  Leasing and alternative financing arrangements enabled customer access to our systems. While the percentage of systems placed under operating leases fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in the deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods.  Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending, and as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressure. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Third quarter revenue was 1.4 billion, representing a 30% increase from last year and a 4% decrease from last quarter.  The compound annual revenue growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 12%. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected growth in both procedures and system placements. The decrease relative to the second quarter of 2021 reflects lower instrument and accessory revenue associated with lower procedures and increased leasing as a percentage of placements.  Leasing represent 41% of current quarter placements compared with 35% last year and 33% last quarter. Leasing as a percentage of total sales has and will continue to fluctuate with customer and geographic mix. However, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates.  40% of systems placed in the third quarter involve trade-ins, which is consistent with the 40% last year and higher than the 38% last quarter. As customers continue to upgrade to fourth-generation capabilities, the population of installed SI is decreasing, particularly in U.S. where 97 trade-ins were completed in the third quarter, leaving an installed base of SIs of approximately 425 systems.  As a result, we expect lower trade-out transactions over time. Trading activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. Third quarter average selling prices increased to 1.57 million from 1.55 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. Average selling prices will fluctuate with geographic and product mix.  Consistent with historical patterns, we expect a higher mix and systems sold to distributors in the fourth quarter, which carry lower prices. We recognized 25 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared to 17 million last year and 26 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter, and will likely continue to do so.  Instrument accessory revenue per procedure of $1,900 decreased slightly compared with $1,910 per procedure for the third quarter of last year, and decreased compared with $1,940 per procedure in the second quarter. The year-over-year change reflects increased usage of extended-use instruments, mostly offset by increased usage of our advanced instruments.  The decrease from the previous quarter reflects customers continuing to adjust their instrument buying patterns to reflect the additional uses per instrument included in extended-use instruments. Ten of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP Systems. Our installed base of SP Systems is now 89, 10 in Korea, and 79 in the U.S.  We continue our measured roll out of SP as we work on gathering clinical data to gain additional procedure clearances in the U.S. We placed 28 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 98 systems. There were approximately 2,000 Ion procedures completed in the third quarter. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall da Vinci system and procedure counts.  Our rollout of  Progressing well. Outside the U.S. we placed 109 systems in the third quarter compared with 79 in the third quarter of 2020 and 115 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 47 into Europe, 20 into Japan, and 17 into China, compared with 39 into Europe, 15 into Japan, and 12 into China in the third quarter of 2020.  We also placed 9 systems in Brazil in the third quarter and now have placed 23 systems in Brazil over the past four quarters. Moving on to gross margin, and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 71.3% compared with 70.2% for the third quarter of 2020 and 71.7% last quarter.  The third quarter of 2020 included 23 million of service credits issued in conjunction with our customer relief program, higher period costs associated with lower production levels, and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. The decline in gross margin relative to the second quarter primarily reflects product mix.  Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. COVID has impacted global supplier of semiconductors and other materials used in our products. While to date we've been able to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, our teams are expending significant time and effort to bridge future supply with demand.  To date we've experienced immaterial component increase, cost increases, and freight expedition fees. However, global shortages could result in future supply disruptions as well as delayed development and regulatory activities. We also expect supply issues to result in higher production costs.  Pro forma operating expenses increased 21% compared with the third quarter of 2020, and increased 2% compared with last quarter. The increase, compared to the prior year, reflects costs associated with higher headcount, increased variable compensation, and increased spending in areas impacted by COVID.  Third quarter spending was below our expectations due to delays in headcount hiring and lower spending on activities restricted by COVID, including clinical development, marketing events, and travel costs. In addition, COVID delayed some R&D work resulting in under spend on prototypes. We expect spending on activities restricted by COVID to increase as the impacts of the pandemic decline.  We also expect spending to increase as a percentage of revenue as investments in headcount infrastructure and other support area s catch-up to the growth of the business. Finally, we expect to continue to invest in expanding and accelerating our ecosystem of products and capabilities. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%.  We recorded expense of 11 million associated with periods prior to 2020 related to guidance recently provided by the IRS associated with stock-based compensation. We expect our pro forma tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 21.5%. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities, and with the impact of one-time items.  Our third quarter pro forma net income was 435 million, or $1.19 per share, compared with 334 million, or $0.92 per share, for the third quarter of 2020, and 477 million or $1.31 per share for the last quarter. Third quarter 2021 and 2020 included pre -tax gains of approximately 8 million and 62 million associated with investments in companies that resulted from development agreements entered into in prior years. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was 381 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of 314 million or $0.87 per share for the third quarter of 2020 and GAAP net income of 517 million or $1.42 per share for the last quarter.  We ended the quarter with cash and investments of 8.2 billion compared with 7.7 billion last quarter. The increase in cash in the third quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie.
Jamie Samath: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was approximately 20% compared to growth of 7% during the third quarter of 2020. Q3 procedure growth reflected 16% growth in U.S. procedures, and 30% growth in all U.S. markets. In the U.S. procedures in Q3 were adversely impacted by an increase in COVID related hospitalizations due to the Delta variant.  Procedures were particularly impacted in those states with relatively lower vaccination rates. As the number of COVID-related hospitalizations peaked and began to improve in September, we saw U.S. procedures start to recover. Q3 growth reflected relative strength in bariatric procedures, cholecystectomy, and hernia repair.  In the more mature procedure categories, year-over-year growth in prostatectomy was strong relative to historical averages and benign hysterectomy grew in the low single-digits range. Third quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 30% compared with 9% growth for the third quarter of 2020.  Third quarter of 2021 OUS procedures were driven by growth in prostatectomy and earlier stage growth in general surgery, gynecology, kidney cancer procedures, and thoracic surgery. China procedure growth remain strong and broad-based as a result of continued expansion of the installed base under the current quarter and the addition and training of surgeons new to the da Vinci platform.  Growth in Japan was solid, but was impacted by localized lockdowns stemming from ongoing efforts to prevent resurgences of COVID. Growth in Korea was also solid, primarily driven by gynecology, urology, and head and neck procedures. A little more than half of the procedures in these three key Asian markets are outside of urology.  In Europe, procedure growths vary by country based on the relative impact of the Delta variant and the impact of COVID -related mitigation measures. Growth in the UK and Germany was solid, with procedure growth in France and Italy impacted by reduced capacity for surgery as hospitals reserved resources for potential increases in COVID patients.  During Q3, customers in the U.S. and Europe effectively consumed their remaining inventory of 10 life instruments following the launch of extended-use instruments in those regions in Q4 of last year. With this full adoption in the U.S., customers are benefiting from INA per procedure costs that reduce by approximately 10% in lower acuity procedures such as cholecystectomy and hernia repair.  In Europe, customers are benefiting from an even larger reduction in NIA costs for target procedures. While recent procedure trends are confounded by the various waves of the pandemic, we believe based on customer feedback that the adoption of extended-use instruments is having a positive impact on targeted procedures.  In our new platform, Ion procedures increased almost 4 folds as compared to Q3 of 2020, driven by significant expansion of the number of systems of customers and an increase in usage in the existing installed base. Our single-port platform, which is gauged by additional regional and clinical clearances, showed solid performance with almost 50% year-over-year procedure growth.  Now, turning to the clinical side of our business, each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deemed to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive details of scientific studies that have been published over the years.  During the quarter, Dr. Michael Kent from Beth Israel Deaconess Center, Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, published results from a landmark multi-center Pulmonary Open, Robotic and Thoracoscopic Lobectomy or PORTaL study in y the annals of surgery.  This retrospective study sponsored by Intuitive compared lobectomy outcomes associated with open, VATS, and robotic assisted da Vinci surgery with over 6,000 cases included in this analysis. After 1-to-1 propensity score matching, a comparison of open and da Vinci lobectomies with approximately 800 patients in each group, showed a two-day shorter length of stay, and a 9.5% lower rate of prolonged hospital stay associated with da Vinci lobectomies.  The da Vinci cohort also had an approximately 8-minute shortened  time for cases without a concomitant procedure. Post - operative complications were approximately 9% lower with the da Vinci robotic approach.  With regards to the propensity score match comparison of minimally invasive approaches with over 1,700 patients in each group, the da Vinci approach evidenced of 1.1 day shorter mean length of stay, and a 6.1% low rate of conversion to thoracotomy when compared to VATS, with the differences in conversion rates report for each tumor stage in the analysis.  The authors concluded in part, "In this retrospective multi-institutional data analysis, both robotic-assisted and VATS lobectomy were associated with improved peri -operative outcomes compared to open lobectomy. " Robotic-assisted lobectomy was associated with additional differences compared to VATS, such as a reduced length of stay and conversion rate.  In August of this year, Professor Umberto Bracale from the University of Naples Federico II in Naples, Italy published a systematic review with meta-analysis of transversus abdominis release (TAR) for ventral hernia repair, assessing short-term outcomes of the open and robotic-assisted approaches.  The macroanalysis combined six studies, containing over 800 patients, of whom just over 200 patients underwent robotic - assisted da Vinci surgery, and just under 600 patients who underwent the open approach. Results of this macroanalysis found that robotic-assisted approach was associated with a full point 4 day shorter length of stay, 64% lower risk of post-operative complications, and 79% low risk of developing systemic complications.  Readmission and reoperations were comparable between both groups. The office concluded in part, "Based on the data for the metro analysis, the robotic approach for TAR seem safe and feasible, even in more difficult cases. Robotic assisted TAR shows the common advantages of minimally invasive procedures that improve short-term outcomes with significant benefits in the early post-operative period. " Lastly, as noted in yesterday's press release, preliminary results from the precise study evaluating outcomes associated with the Ion endoluminal system will present into the Annual CHEST Conference. This preliminary analysis of 69 subjects showed a diagnostic yield of 83% with a sensitivity of malignancy of 84% to 88% from the biopsy of peripheral pulmonary nodules with a mean size of 17 millimeters.  These initial outcomes regarding the performance of the Ion system are encouraging and we look forward to the full study being published in the second half of 2022. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. During Q3, we experienced a more challenging supply chain environment for the deterioration in on-time delivery performance from our suppliers. We also saw increased supply chain costs.  While this did not have a material impact to our operating results in Q3, the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to supply constraints. Starting with procedures, last quarter we forecast 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 30%. Given Q3 results and the impact of the Delta variant, we are now narrowing our full cost and expect full-year 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 29%.  This procedure outlook does not reflect a significant impact from a  stopping shortages or a resurgence of COVID-19. The high-end of the range assumes the COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the U.S. continued the recovery that began in September, and the COVID -related mitigation measures in OUS markets continued to ease.  Turning to gross profit, on our last call, we forecast our 2021 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70.5% and 71.5% of revenue. We now expect 2021 pro forma gross profit margin to be within 71% and 71.5% of revenue. This range does not reflect any significant disruption associated with the current supply chain challenges.  Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product, regional, and trade-in mix, the impact of product cost reductions in manufacturing efficiencies, and competitive pricing pressure. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast to grow full-year pro forma 2021 operating expenses between 17% and 21% above 2020 levels.  We are refining our estimate and now expect a full-year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 17% and 19%. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between 450 and 460 million in 2021. With regard to pro forma other income which is comprised mostly of interest income, we expect a range of between 50, 55 million in 2021.  Finally, with respect to income tax, we expect our Q4 2021 pro forma tax rate to be approximately 21.5% of pre - tax income. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question . We'll go first to Amit Hassan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Hello. Thanks and good afternoon. I want to come back to the supply chain comment first. Just ask you how visibility looks for componentry now versus maybe a little bit earlier this year, what lead times look like now, it sounds tighter, just a little more color around that and to what extent have you already been able to either double order, for lack of a better term, I guess, or stockpile this year, and how viable of an option does that remain for you?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. I think -- Amit, it's Marshall. The environment, as it relates to supply chain, has deteriorated and got more difficult over time. And as we said, we've dedicated substantial resources to dealing with those shortages. And it has not, to-date, created an issue with us supplying customer demand. But there is a risk, and it's a real risk until we call it out to make sure that everybody is aware of that.  From the perspective of costs, we talked some cost increased material costs last quarter. They were not significant. And we also incurred some expediting fees associated with freight. Again, not material. But going forward, we do expect increased costs, and that will probably hit the margin in Q4 or Q1. It's hard to predict exactly how much until -- I think that summarizes it for you. It's difficult environment right now.
Jamie Samath: I just -- I think our supply chain and manufacturing teams are doing great. I think they're working in a tough macro-environment, and that macro-environment will clear up when it clears up.
Operator: Our next question we go to Larry Biegelstein with Wells Fargo. Go ahead, please.
Lawrence Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two for me: one on Ion, Gary, and then one on procedures. So the precise data look good. Yesterday, I guess the question is do you think the early data suggests your shape sensing technology can lead to better yields and lower pneumothorax rates versus your main competitor, which uses a different technology? And how much of a catalyst do you think the data from yesterday will be for Ion? And I just have one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I think that the architecture as a whole, the shape sensor, the way it works, the design choices about making a soft catheter that's quite and can go deep into the  been really strong for us. And I think the data speaks for itself.  You can compare for yourself the data that focuses and that for Monarch, and we feel great about where we are. I think it is catalyzing. As we speak, I think that those results are helping us in the market. Our customers are giving us really good feedback. And we continue to invest in operations part of that program as well as the innovation side. We feel really good about.
Lawrence Biegelsen: Thanks for that, Gary. And then on procedures, I guess it sounds like most or if not all major markets are moving in the right direction. I'd love to hear a little bit more color, particularly on the U.S. and it sounds like Jamie, and by the way congratulations on the new role, it sounds like we should expect normal seasonality in Q4.  When we look at 2018 and 2019, the sequential procedure growth was very similar worldwide U.S. and OUS, is it possible that it could be a little stronger given that we're seeing a recovery? Thanks for taking the question.
Jamie Samath: Thank you, Larry, by the way. I would say this, what are reflected in the high-end of our procedure guidance are really two things. Those COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the U.S. continued the recovery that began in September, and that was in the middle part of September that that recovery commenced. So there's a progression there that continues through Q4.  It also assumes that the mitigation measures in OUS markets, which are typically a little more conservative than we see in the U.S., continued to ease, and those also started to ease in September. At the low end, what we see is a slower recovery in the U.S. from what we saw in Q3 and choppiness OUS in terms of the on-off of mitigation measures in various markets. And so that range of 27% to 29% that we provided, really it's just a function of the rate at which we recover from what occurred in Q3 with the Delta variant. That was a little color on that.
Lawrence Biegelsen: Thanks so much. Yeah. Go ahead.
Gary Guthart: Just jumping in. I think there are two things that are going on. One is, what will pace us is hospital availability for surgery  it. It's not infection rate, it's going to be resourced consumption at the hospital and their ability to pivot their resources, both human capital and facilities, back towards surgery.  As you double-click on that, some of it is regional variance, but some of it is actually just hospital system variance. There are differences in how each hospital has managed it. So it's hard to generalize, I think, beware of averages.
Lawrence Biegelsen: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Go ahead, please.
Robert Hopkins: Thank you and good afternoon. Just to follow up on that last question. So for Jamie or Marshall, I guess, therefore, do the procedure volumes that you are forecasting for Q4, is that assuming improving year-over-year growth in Q4 versus the year-over-year growth in Q3, or about the same?
Jamie Samath: Yes. The -- I think what's implied by the guidance that we provided at the low-end of Q4 year-over-year growth will be 15%. At the high end, it will be 22%. So you compare that to what we showed in Q3 of '20, and you see the range is above and below what we recorded in Q3. And I think again, it just reflects both the year-over-year comparison in terms of the base for Q4 in 2020 as well as the range of scenarios in terms of what actually occurs with procedures in Q4.
Robert Hopkins: Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one quick one for Gary, I was struck by your comments in your opening remarks about your -- how your multi-port systems now have 70 clinical uses. And I was curious, you just elaborate on that a little bit. Is that 70 different surgical procedures or how are you characterizing clinical usage? I found that an interesting number.
Gary Guthart: Yeah, that's right. It's the number of different procedures that's described in our labeling as to where this might be used in the body or in sub-specialties. So if you look in urology, there's a handful of different procedures that it can be used for and likewise gynecology general surgery. And as you just walk through, that's a set of procedures for which we've engaged the agency and put in our labeling. So they are quite broadly applied.
Robert Hopkins: Okay. My model only has 10, so I guess I have some work to do. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: You got 10. And we're not done. I think surgeons and we and regulatory agencies around the world continue to explore where else technologies like ours can go.
Robert Hopkins: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Good afternoon. I wanted -- I think you can elaborate a little bit more on the staffing shortage comments. I know this isn't maybe fully baked into guidance, but how much risk do you think this presents? How widespread it did? Obviously, there's very tight labor market, but just something you're seeing across most of your customers or how would you characterize it?
Gary Guthart: On the -- you're referring to the customer side?
Tycho Peterson: Correct.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Jamie wanted to talk a little bit about it.
Jamie Samath: Yeah. We've had anecdotal inputs from some customers that they're facing staffing shortages. Other customers have said to us that they're able to overcome those risks. And so given the mix dynamics and the lack of clear evidence in terms of its impact on procedures, what we've said is the remainder of the year guidance does not reflect any significant disruption from the last staffing shortages, meaning that there's no deterioration in the phenomena for hospitals.
Tycho Peterson: And then another dynamic you flagged was just the selling cycle. Obviously, early days on the competitive front, but on the back of the CE Mark for Medtronic, I'm just curious, out of your -- what you're hearing from your sales reps just in terms of early interest, potential demos things like that.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I think with several of the other systems that are on the market, and as you say, the most recent one, we see early engagement. Those first engagements tend to be a placement of clinical trial sites and training centers and so on. So they are not surprising. They're their early access programs to get into the market up.  So far there are far a number of claims about what these new systems will do and I think the reality is time will tell the genuine systems. I think evidenced has to be generated to backup those claims. And so far, we don't see anything yet that looks like evidence. Just the said claims, so we'll keep serving our customer, doing what we can to make sure that they can achieve the quadrupling. And we'll see how other companies do.
Tycho Peterson: Maybe last one, we have we always get the question about new system for you guys. It feels like that you picked up a little bit lately. You're putting up good system numbers. I'm curious in your view, is that something the market needs right now? What do you wanted to say, if anything at all, about the appetite for another system from you guys or anything you may be working on?
Gary Guthart: First thing is that we think there is room for innovation on all the platforms we have. So whether it's multi-port and Gen 4, we continue to innovate. We've done a lot of sequential innovation on Gen 4, so our X and XI are different  we continue to invest both in incremental opportunities and in deeper, bigger opportunities on multi-port.  And as we're ready to roll those out, you'll hear about it. We brought to market SP, we continue to innovate on SP, and get sequential products and clearances globally for SP. And likewise Ion, which is having great success early in its first indication but we think has opportunities deeper in the body and different locations in the body, which will proceed and describe over time.  So yeah, I think you should expect continued innovation from us. As to whether we think that we're in immediate need of something, we are innovating at a pace where we think we can bring things that matter to the quadrupling, not so much an idea of what's our retail strategy, but more can we do something that changes quadrupling or otherwise improves the customer experience, and that's what we're focused on.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Go ahead, please.
Frederick Wise: Good afternoon, everybody. One focused question and then a larger picture when Gary when you -- in your opening comments, you mentioned that extended life instruments, if I understood, have reached I thinks the urban forward was equilibrium.  I just want to make sure I understood what you were implying that suggest that the initial phase of adoption has happened and we're going to see better growth X, sort of initial stocking ASP impact. And is there a second round of instruments? This has been so successful. How all should we think about all that?
Gary Guthart: Well, with regard to what I meant by equilibrium, it was really that the initial stocking orders and the transition from older instruments to newer is largely taking place, but I'll let Jamie answer that more carefully than I just did.
Jamie Samath: Actually, I think that's right, Gary. There's a period of time when as we launched extended-use instruments, customers in the U.S. and Europe in particular were ordering those instruments array higher than their usage as they consume the 10 life instruments that took some time to gain to parity. And so you saw in the end of positive benefit to Ion per procedure in Q1 and Q2.  Q3 for those regions that largely came to parity. We did launch extended-use instruments later in Asia and some of the rest of the world countries. And so they are still working their way to parity. So there will be small downward pressure on NIA per procedure holding everything else equal as they get to parity looking forward.
Frederick Wise: Thank you.
Gary Guthart: The second half of your question, just to finish it, you talked about are we done, is that it for these kinds of ideas and extended-use instruments and da Vinci, these were design and process investments that we made to pursue what we think of is the virtuous cycle. The idea that if we can improve quality and lower cost for our customers, that they can use our products in more and different procedures.  And we're not done doing that. It may not look exactly like what we've done in the past, there are other things that we think we can do with it. Allow them high-value systems at different price points, or value instruments at different price points, so that line of reasoning has not exhausted.
Frederick Wise: And Gary, just one last big picture question. Obviously, you've created 2 new senior leadership roles here, for Marshall and for Dave Rosa. Maybe just -- if you could just flush out your thinking.  Is it simply -- and it would be enough that Intuitive has gotten so large and complex in the future, to survive, you just need more senior leadership -- focused leadership? Or what are you charging? What are you expecting? What should we expect from Marshall and Dave in the coming years? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for that question. Over the last few years, we've had an expansion of business and expansions of opportunity, both are happening. On the business side, we want to make sure that we serve our customers at very high-quality quickly in local regions where we can, and that we take advantage of a lot of the systems enterprise data that we have to help drive the business and help our customer.  And that's something that Marshall has been doing and I've asked them to double down on that to make sure that we can really take advantage of our global scale and serve our customers in our business really well at that scale. And it's an opportunity and it's a real work. The flip side is I have never been more positive about the long-term opportunity for companies like ours that can master the kinds of things that we have to do to help minimum invasive care and interventions.  And so there's real opportunity there. And I'd like us to get there quickly to have the agility and focus to be able to open new ideas and new architectures and new markets. And I can think of nobody more qualified to lead that effort than Dave Rosa, who is visited just about all parts of the Company.  He started off as an engineer and scientist and has done many things for us. So we're really trying to get the advantages of scale to help our global customer and also be agile in capitalizing on growth opportunities as we see them.
Frederick Wise: Thank you so much, Gary.
Operator: Next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Go ahead, please.
Matt Taylor: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping maybe, Marshall, you could talk a little bit more about the supply chain issues from the standpoint of just helping us get visibility or understand how close you are to the edge there. And meaning, you keep calling out this risk that exists but it sounds like you've been doing a really good job with managing things so far.  Is there any benchmark numbers you can give us to help us understand what the lead times are in some of the key things that could get disrupted or the likelihood that it will happen? Is it getting better or is there a real risk of you not being able to ship some product is I guess the core of the question?
Marshall Mohr: I don't think I can say it's getting better. I actually think that it's difficult situation and will continue for some time. If you think about the one that's been talked about the most, the semiconductors, you've seen it in the auto industry, it's an issue in computers. And if you had to order any home goods that contained chips, you would know that there's a problem there.  That will take a long time to remedy. It takes a long time to build fabs, it takes a long time to produce product, and so I think that will go well into next year the predictions that we're hearing. I think Gary told you our team has done a marvelous job so far. So I think there are issues on a regular basis, and the issues so far that our team has been able to resolve those.  I don't have any statistics to provide you on how often, or what it means. I would just say that some -- anecdotally, some lead times have extended beyond 6 months. That's not all our products, and it's not an average you should apply to everything, but in some cases it's pretty long. And so I think it's a problem we highlight as just to make sure that you're aware of the risk.
Matt Taylor: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.
Amit Hazan: Thank you for that. I thought maybe just to follow up on the spiky question was just a little bit more on just inflationary headwinds generally. And Marshall, just how you're seeing labor costs growth today versus early in the year or more normal times and raw material cost growth versus normal times.  And it's just hard for us to start thinking about these things along with what you commented on the supply chain for next year is just qualitatively as we start to think about where operating margins might go.
Marshall Mohr: We've seen some cost increases. Again, they haven't been that significant. And frankly, our teams have done a marvelous job of sort with efficiency and effectiveness to offset those increased costs. But we're hearing from suppliers that they're going to raise their prices.  And so we're saying that hey, we expect that costs will go up more. Not sure. I want to say that the inflation where it is has hit us and am here to stay, but we are seeing some supplier's raise costs.
Amit Hazan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from  Evercore ISI. Evercore ISI,? go ahead, please.
Vijay Kumar: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, maybe 2 quick one’s for you. The precise study 80% diagnostic resolution. Could you -- is that good enough, Gary? Certainly, when -- the headline numbers, when we look at other studies, it's a good number. But I'm just curious, is the point where the market beckon to these new numbers and should we see an inflection in adoption of Ion?  And just one quick one on 3Q. I know you called out the Delta but was there any labor shortage impact in 3Q itself? Because historically we haven't seen the pandemic impact or Intuitive has outperformed peers. It just perhaps a little excessive in 3Q. Was there something else going on? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Okay. On the first one, in terms of diagnostic yield, you had said 82% and I guess what I'd advise everybody is, there's a couple of numbers that are important and they stay linked together. And that is what the size of the lesion is? And then what's the positive diagnostic rate, the ability to definitively diagnose? That's what the interventional pulmonologists are looking at.  So the bigger the lesion, if it's 3-centimeter lesion, your diagnostic yield rate is going to go up your definitive because it's easier to hit. So you got to look at both numbers. It's not a single metric. So 82 for smaller lesions are leading, as far as I can tell for endobronchial approaches for that approach. Some folks can get to higher yield rates, but they are hitting bigger targets.  So you need to look at both, and that's what I encourage you to do. The second thing that I advise you is that there are other ways to examine or get a biopsy. There can be outside the body, CT-guided needle biopsies, and those outside the body CT-guided needle biopsies have high success rates at gathering the tissue, but they have a lower safety profile than the endobronchial approach.  So there's a third dimension, which is, did you get the tissue you needed to get a definitive diagnosis? How big was the lesion you were trying to target? Then what was the complication rate. And we think that Ion is really good at managing all 3 of those relative to competitive approaches, and we're seeing a nice uptick as a result. And is that a tipping point? We'll see. So far, so good. That's what we had expected.  This kind of performance, that's what we were targeting. We're pleased to see it being borne out over multiple sites and multiple customers, and we think that's going to be helpful. With regard to your second question, you were talking a little bit about are we seeing an unusual or more aggressive slowdown because of Delta, then perhaps others.  What I'd encourage you to think about there is where in the world everybody is exposed and where they are seeing their growth. So in our case, we have a certain regional profile where our procedures are being done. Other companies may have much bigger exposure to say markets or countries that have a lower impact having to do with Delta. Frankly, I think it's as simple as that, but time will tell on that as well.  So let's go ahead and conclude. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions.  Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians, and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed a Quadruple Aim: better more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately a lower total cost of care.  We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It falls from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs, and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to speaking with you again in three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T event conferencing. You may now disconnect.

Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon and good morning to folks on the West Coast. I'm Larry Biegelsen, the medical device analyst at Wells Fargo, and it's my pleasure to host this session with the management team from Intuitive Surgical. With us, we have Marshall Mohr, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Philip Kim, Head of Investor Relations. In terms of format, it's going to be a fireside chat. If anyone has a question they want me to ask on their behalf, please email it to me. I think we're going to try to get in one or two polling questions. And I think before we jump in, Phil, you wanted to make some opening remarks.
Philip Kim: Sure. Before we get started, I'd like to mention that comments made this morning maybe deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our SEC filings. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
Larry Biegelsen: All right. So, gentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Really appreciate you guys participating in our conference again this year.
Marshall Mohr: Thanks for having us, Larry. We're happy to be here.
Q - Larry Biegelsen: Marshall, I hope next year, we don't have to ask you about COVID. But we feel like we're starting almost all of these conversations with just kind of, any qualitative color you can provide on the Delta variant and what was embedded in your guidance? I went back and looked at kind of your transcript, the low end assumes some impact of resurgence in the U.S. but I'm just curious if you can qualitatively talk about any trends you're seeing.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. Thanks Larry. Let me say good afternoon to everybody, and thanks for having us at the conference. Yes, we saw in Q2, it was actually a rebound that was quicker than we had expected. And if you look at the compound annual growth rate relative to 2019, so pre-COVID, it was 16.5%. Growth rates back in 2018 and 2019 were in the 18% to 19% range. And so, a little lower then. But if you were to have drawn a line looking at adoption curves and so forth, 16.5% was nearly a recovery. So it was quite nice. Having said that, going into this quarter, obviously we've seen a resurgence of the Delta variant that has had a significant impact on household resources over the past month or so, regionally. You see most severe in places like Texas and Florida and some of the South where vaccination rates are lower. And in those areas, you're actually seeing some level that hospital resources are strained and you're seeing some level of deferral of procedures again. And there is a direct correlation between hospital resource availability and how strained it is and deferrable procedures and da Vinci procedures for that matter, and there are a number of da Vinci procedures that are deferrable in the short-term. Now they’re chronic conditions, so, they -- eventually the patients have to be treated, but they can be things like hernias and cholecystectomies and bariatric procedures can be deferred in the short-term. So, given the resurgence, you should expect that it is having some impact on our procedures. How deep, how much of an impact is really difficult to predict. You have access to the various models out there that the various professionals put out there about what will happen with resurgence. So, you have access to that data, and we're not going to try to predict what the extent or the length of this is going to be. But -- and I would also comment that it varies by region within the U.S. You see more severe conditions in the South, and in geographies I mentioned, and much less severe in some of the other geographies like the Northeast and then it varies around the world as well. You see less of an impact in China right now. Little bit of impact in Japan, although the hospitals seem be getting through things pretty well. You see some impacts in places like the UK and India. So anyway, I don't have something specific to give you. But I can just tell you, just in general what we're saying.
Larry Biegelsen: And just a couple follow-ups. One is, maybe, if you can't disclose this, I understand. But is it worse than you kind of expected when you gave your guidance? I mean, it seems like most people didn't expect it to be this bad. Is that a fair conclusion?
Marshall Mohr: Yes, it is. Yes. Going back to our guidance, you said it, so I didn't repeat it, but I'll repeat it now. And that is, our guidance didn't assume any significant disruption or additional costs associated with supply constraints, which, frankly, supply constraints has dealt with potential problems. And then the second one is, I didn't assume any significant or widespread impact of COVID in the United States. And I think we are indeed seeing that.
Larry Biegelsen: And it's interesting, because you talked about the 16.5% CAGR in the first half, to your CAGR I think. So big picture, we know whole COVID’s transient, you see these procedures whenever COVID does wane, these procedures coming back? And you can get back to kind of the underlying trajectory, Marshall, just to kind of bring home the point that this is transient, and the underlying trends for your business are still strong.
Marshall Mohr: I think that's right. I think we still believe that the opportunity for computer aided interventions is significant that robotics that you'll see -- long-term, we've talked about a line of sight market of 6 million procedures, there's many more procedures than that, that could be done robotically. And we believe that opportunity has not changed. All COVID has done is disrupt sort of the pace at which you get there.
Larry Biegelsen: And you've talked about on the call -- you just mentioned it a minute ago, and you talked about the call, inflation and potential supply constraints. And you've called that out as a risk before. But I believe until through the second quarter call that it was more of a risk as opposed to something that was materializing. Can you talk about kind of what you're seeing, I guess, on both fronts, one is inflation, one is supply constraints, and how those might be impacting you?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. Frankly, it's hand to hand combat on when it comes to supply and I don't think we're unusual. I think you’re reading it in the papers, the car industry, the computer industry and if any of you are trying to order products that contain semiconductors, you see that the lead times have been extended significantly for all products. So when I say hand to hand combat, our teams are working hard with our suppliers to make sure that we have the supplies necessary to be able to supply our customers' needs. And so far they were successful, certainly through Q2 and if I had something significant to say today, I would. But having said that, the risk is still there and the risk is so significant that at some point in time there is the potential that a supplier is unable to supply what we need. We also through Q2 had not seen, you call out, inflation. Either inflation caused by demand supply, normal pressures or inflation in terms of suppliers just trying to charge us more because the opportunity is there. So, it hasn't had much of an impact at all. I would say that, as we go forward, though, one area that will likely see increased costs is freight. And the reason is that you're having to expedite parts either into the factory or from the factory out to customer. And so we'll see some of that, price is not a huge part of our costs but nonetheless we'll see increased freight.
Larry Biegelsen: When we think about kind of next year Marshall, what are some of the puts and takes to think about on the top line and bottom line?
Marshall Mohr: Yes, I think at a top line level, again, it's hard to predict at this point in time what COVID will do to procedures. We'll give our views on procedures at the end of January for 2022. As far as system placements, we've actually -- through Q2 we saw a nice pickup in systems, on that surprised us actually, because we had expected the hospital finances and resources would be constrained. And yet they came out of the COVID at least to that point in better shape. We could see going forward the COVID has an impact on that going forward. The gives and takes on the top line also will have to do with the replacement cycle. We've had a tailwind for systems in terms of replacements. You've seen nice trade-outs of third generation product to fourth generation and but over time that third generation population out in the field, the installed base actually declines and therefore you'll see less trade-ins take place. Top line, also leasing impacts the top line in the short-term. In the long-term, it's actually very beneficial. We would expect leasing to fluctuate quarter to quarter but to increase as a percentage of total sales over time. So that'll have a negative impact. On the bottom line, know that we think that the opportunity in front of us like we said earlier is the same and therefore we're going to continue to invest in both innovation, digital innovation, expanded instrumentation and accessory capabilities. And so you'll see us invest in Ion and SP. And so from a cost perspective, we will continue to spend. So all I would say is that those of you that are thinking that the profitability you saw last quarter will either sustain itself or will increase, I wouldn't think that. Last quarter, what you did see was that the recovery of revenue took place faster than the recovery of costs. And what I mean by that is, costs that were eliminated or minimized by virtue of COVID, travel, marketing events and so forth were still being constrained in Q2, but we saw a rebound in the overall business. And so, that profitability in Q2 was I think a bit of an anomaly. And you'll see again us continue to spend in this environment.
Larry Biegelsen: Marshall, a lot to unpack there.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. Sorry. Didn't mean to go on…
Larry Biegelsen: So, on procedures we've talked about earlier. I think we covered that pretty well. On placements and COVID, actually a lot of companies have talked about the capital environment remaining healthy, even recently. I've heard companies talk about a favorable capital environment. Can we -- is that -- I mean can you give us any color on whether you've seen changes in the capital environment or not?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. We won't talk about the inter-quarter play here. We can say that at the end of Q2, things had gone, like I said, better than our expectations. And it was reflective of, frankly, I think that a lot of what happened in Q2 was expansion of existing programs at large IDNs, and that's an endorsement of robotics being beneficial in both in terms of treatment of patients meeting their quadruple aim, reducing their overall cost of care. And so -- and then they were preparing, I think, for -- at that point, everybody thought we had COVID licked in and things were going to continue to improve. And so I think they were also preparing for a post-COVID environment. They're going forward. Capital is driven by -- so I won't comment on expectations. We don't provide guidance on capital because of short-term swings that can occur. But the -- I would just tell you the factors that could impact it. Number one is, know that procedures drive capital in our mature markets. And so we talk about utilization statistic. That is an indication of whether capital is getting ahead or behind procedures. And I think that it was in tune. They were in tune with each other through Q2. But if procedures are significantly curtailed as a result of COVID, then it could have an impact on capital. I mentioned the trade-in cycle. The trade-in cycle will decline as the population of third-generation product out in the field declines. I mentioned leasing. And I think we don't know what will happen from a COVID perspective to hospital financing going forward. And then finally, I think as competition comes out, we do expect to see longer sales cycles and potential price degradation.
Larry Biegelsen: Marshall, when does the trade-in -- or when does that become a headwind for you guys? Is there a way to be more precise? And how many are still in the field? And when does that become -- go from a tailwind to a headwind?
Marshall Mohr: I'll let Philip provide you the statistics.
Philip Kim: Yes, Larry, over time, you should expect the percentage of trade-ins to come down as the installed base of Gen 3 declines and upgrades. Roughly 20% of the worldwide installed base is Gen 3 or older. And so has a lot of large numbers. As we work through that, that should be less of a tailwind. More broadly, with leasing, we've always said in the past that we expect that to continue to be a larger percentage of our placements as time increases and we're just trying to provide our customers as much flexibility as possible.
Marshall Mohr: And there's about 600 systems in the U.S. that are third generation or older, unlike a number outside the U.S. Outside the U.S., there are places like China where those systems haven't been installed for very long. Xi was not approved, regulatory was until about 1.5 years, 2 years ago in China. So we expect that element, that set of systems to return more slowly over a longer period of time. In the U.S., what we saw last quarter was that, that decreased the trade-in cycle. It was roughly 20% of the systems outstanding have been traded-in in that quarter. So if that pace were to continue, then you'll see a substantial decline certainly through the end of next year.
Larry Biegelsen: Got it. Marshall, you talked about leverage in the P&L a minute ago. Historically, you guys have delivered 1x to 1.5x leverage. Is that ratio come to the lower end next year, should we be thinking based on your commentary? Or I don't know if you can comment on that at all. But the Street right now is kind of has kind of the low end of that for 2022.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. We'll give you a specific guidance for '22 when we get to the end of January. I think what we're foreshadowing is that this is a period of investment for us. We think we still have to invest in both Ion and SP, which are in their earlier stages. In the case of Ion, we have regulatory approvals. We'll seek in outside the United States, we have also -- it's in other potential indications and uses for it. In the case of SP, we'll be investing heavily in clinical trials to be able to obtain additional indications and to attain clearances in other markets outside of the U.S. So I think those are 2 big investment areas. Again, data is probably the greatest area of increased investment and will continue to be. And then you'll see a return in certain expenses that just as COVID wanes, you'll see increased travel, marketing events and other activities that have before now been caused by COVID. So as far as leverage goes, like I said earlier, you should not expect profitability at the level that you saw in Q2 going forward, Q2 was an anomaly, and we will continue to invest.
Larry Biegelsen: Got it. You touched upon competition, Marshall, a couple of times. Obviously, we -- Medtronic potentially coming to the market in Europe in the second half of this calendar year. When -- if the selling cycle is elongated, what would you expect -- when would you expect that to happen, if it were to occur?
Marshall Mohr: It's happened to a certain extent. As you see some of the smaller competitors out there, the hospitals and in parts of where you have government systems like NHS in UK or some of the public hospitals in France and Germany, you -- they're bound to go through tender activities. When it was just us, they actually could -- they had to issue a tender, but they could circumvent the time frame and get it done more quickly. Now they have to go through the full length of time if one of those competitors jumps in the game. Going forward, we expect that more and more of those tenders will see multiple competitors, including companies like Medtronic. And so as that happens, then timelines elongate. What do they elongate to? Think of more like 6-month timeframes OUS versus 3-month timeframes. And in the U.S., you'll probably get some level of contemplation about whether competitive products versus ours make sense. And even though they don't have to go through these formal tender approaches, it could still elongate cycles here, too.
Larry Biegelsen: And do you think this starts once they get CE Mark? Or people will -- might start hesitating or waiting before it’s done?
Marshall Mohr: That's a great question. I think you're already seeing competition trying to get customers to slow down their purchases or wait until their product is ready. That's happened for the last 4 years, frankly, when companies thought they might be coming to market more quickly than they actually have been able to. So I don't know. My expectation is they'll continue to try to get customers to slow down and install, but it hasn't had a significant impact to date.
Larry Biegelsen: That's helpful. You’ve talked about kind of the ecosystem really being the key basis for competition. What -- can you elaborate on how you think about the ecosystem you've built relative to the competition?
Marshall Mohr: Sure. I'll let Philip take the first step at it, and then I'll jump in.
Philip Kim: Sure, Larry. So you've heard us frame the ecosystem in the past as really driving outcomes, and we are focused on clinical -- driving clinical outcome. So firstly, we make sure that we understand the customer base deeply. We make sure that we have the right technologies that help them. We have the right instruments and accessories, systems and imaging systems and so on. And we make sure that the operating processes work well, that we have training optimization, service and support, marketing, sales coordination. We make all these investments, they take time. You've seen us put up the slide before at various conferences. It's an entire ecosystem, and it takes time to build these ecosystems. It's not just a robot, it's not just having systems and the instruments, you need to also engage with regulatory agencies to get clearances, decision by indication, get the sanction, you need to know how to train and build the training pathways and you need to build clinical evidence. You need to go country by country. The build has to be engaged with surgical societies, get economic validation. It's all hard work country-by-country, procedure-by-procedure, as you know, Larry. And so we're continuing to invest in that ecosystem, and we're a mission-driven company. We're focused on the better patient outcomes, better surgeon experience, better treatment experience and lowering cost fee. So at the end of the day, we're trying to add value to the ecosystem.
Larry Biegelsen: All right. That's helpful. Let's try 1 polling question, but go to the second one, if you can. And if you can't, just we'll move on. The second one. Okay. Good. All right. So the second question is basically, Medtronic plans to launch its Hugo surgical robot in Europe in the second half of calendar 2021. What impact do you expect you guys to have on Intuitive Surgical? A, expect Hugo to reduce Intuitive placements at least in the near term? B, I expect Hugo to be a catalyst for robotic surgery and ISRG, a so-called rising tide? And C, not sure? There's a bit of a lag. It takes time for them to fill it out. So Marshall, I might ask you another question before we get those results. And I wanted to shift the conversation more to kind of the opportunities you guys have, new procedures, new platforms. And maybe just starting with procedures, Marshall. So when we look at the next years, which procedures do you expect to drive the most growth for Intuitive?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. I think there are procedures that are already in flight, we're really talking about growth over the next couple of years will be driven by general surgery in the U.S. And in that category, you're really talking about continuation of adoption for bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia has been probably the big 3. But there are other areas of general surgeries that also are adopting for that, procedures that are smaller categories, but those will be the primary drivers. And then outside the United States, we're at the top of the urology curve in a number of countries, particularly in Europe. And so what we're seeing as drivers going forward will be thoracic procedures. And by the way, thoracic procedures growing quite nicely in places like China, and then -- and also the general surgery procedures. And in those cases, it probably starts with cancer procedures. And over time then into benign procedures. Reimbursements for benign procedures outside the U.S. are strained, are low. And so that's why we think cancer procedures adapt before the benign.
Larry Biegelsen: Are there new procedures that we should be following?
Marshall Mohr: Well, I think we have 3 platforms now, right? And so if we're talking about multiport procedures, I think that there's lots of room in what we have, and I don't know that other than thoracic procedures that I would throw in anything else, look to Philip to tell me if I'm right or wrong. And -- but when it comes to the other 2 platforms, meaning Ion, yes, we expect to see nice growth in interventions to do lung biopsies, and we're seeing nice growth there. And in the case of SP where you got to have clinical data to be able to get clearances in the United States as well as outside the United States, that will take time. And we're focused on procedures where we think we can contribute the most value, which in a lot of cases, are procedures that are in part done by multiport systems. Longer term, we've talked about the potential of maybe some breast procedures or other things that we'll chase. But right now it's all about colorectal -- getting a colorectal indication as well as expanding in urology and thoracic.
Larry Biegelsen: That's helpful. Did you want to add something, Phil? Or do you want to go to the poll results?
Philip Kim: Let's go to the poll results. I think Marshall covered it perfect.
Larry Biegelsen: Okay. What do we have? Marshall, catalysts for robotics surgery, 42%, 33% near-term headwind. And not sure -- sorry, 25%. Any reaction, Marshall?
Marshall Mohr: I think the first 2 are probably -- I wouldn't disagree with either of them. In other words, I do think that the more you see entrants of competitors and competitors talking about robotics and the benefits of robotics that, that really does expand the market or at least make the parts of the market more accessible. And so I think it does. It is a rising tide with everybody jumping in. We've seen it already. When back in 2000 -- it's probably, what, 2018, '19 when these companies started talking about robotics as something that should be used for surgeries that you saw attitude start to change. And then as far as Hugo reducing ISRG placements, there is no question that there will be surgeons that want to try Hugo. There will be institutions that want to try Hugo. And we'll see how that trialing goes. But initially, they'll do their trial. And does that mean that they delay a placement of ISRG? It's possible. Longer term, we'll see how it turns out and what they choose. I’d find it hard to believe that they would -- that you have hospitals where you have both products and expect surgeons to jump from 1 to the other. So it's probably either or -- but we're not sure. And so that last category is right, too. We're not sure. We have to see what exactly it is they deliver, to Philip's point earlier, how broadly they address the ecosystem of things necessary to be successful and we'll see.
Larry Biegelsen: Okay. Marshall, a couple of minutes left here, but those are very helpful comments. I wanted to sneak a few more in. So Ion, you touched upon it. You're having a lot of success from the placements we've seen early on. How should we think about the pace of adoption of Ion?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. You'll still see us in a measured sort of rollout right now. We're -- the clinical data from the PRECISE trial will be made available at the end of next year. I think what that does is that really opens up the next level of -- in the adoption curve. So you see early adopters doing it now. And then you'll see once that data is out and assuming it's as positive as we believe it will be, then maybe you see a little opening of the majority and then you'll see a broader pace of adoption. But for now, it will be a gradual increase over time. We’re really pleased with how things went last quarter, particularly, almost 1,500 procedures and 20 systems, that was quite a nice performance in our view. So anyway, that's how I kind of think of it. And we are going to start looking at how to obtain clearances outside the U.S. And we'll tell you as we go through time, whether we're filing or where our expectations are for growth.
Larry Biegelsen: In China, it probably is a big opportunity for Ion.
Marshall Mohr: It is. Philip?
Philip Kim: Yes. So with respect to China, we have that partnership with Fosun. But right now, the pathway for China is quite long and complex. And so we'll end up sharing timelines, when we have something that's worth sharing.
Larry Biegelsen: Okay. And Marshall, when do you think we'll know the impact of the Extended Use Instrument Program? I mean, obviously, it's hard -- probably a little bit difficult because of COVID. But when do you think you'll be able to kind of tell us about that -- the impact?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. Thank you. You're right. It is complicated by COVID, and the ability to measure what is COVID versus what is extended use instruments and so forth is really difficult to parse apart right now. What we're hearing from our customers, though, is really positive feedback on the fact that they can do some of these procedures at a lower cost and competitively with other minimally invasive approaches. So we do believe that there will be some elasticity. It's hard for me to answer your question because I really don't know how long COVID is going to have an impact on us. But I think it's probably not for another year that we aren't able to measure it.
Larry Biegelsen: Okay. We're out of time. Marshall, I'm going to give you the last word. Anything -- we covered a lot of ground. But we can a minute or so here if you had any closing remarks or anything, you really wanted to cover that we didn't get to.
Marshall Mohr: No. I think we covered the things -- the key things that I think are important for investors to understand. One is that this is a -- the opportunity is the same. COVID disrupts the pace at which you get there but the opportunity is the same. And as a result, that we will continue to invest in the infrastructure and in the innovation in order to capture as much of that opportunity as possible. And in the meantime, we'll see at the revenue level, what happens.
Larry Biegelsen: Okay. Perfect. Really appreciate you guys being here. I hope the rest of the day goes well for you, and we'll be in touch. Thanks, again.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Larry.
Philip Kim: Thanks, Larry.
Marshall Mohr: Bye, everybody.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-20 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Intuitive Q1 2021 Earnings Release. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be time for questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Philip Kim, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Philip Kim: Good afternoon. And welcome to Intuitive’s first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Samath, our Senior Vice President, Finance. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call maybe deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2021. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC’s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today’s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our financial results. I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights. And Jaime will review our financial outlook. Finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter of 2021 was a step in the right direction. In the quarter, we saw a healthy recovery of surgery and use of our products. Strong capital placements continued in Q1 2021 and utilization of installed systems increased through the quarter, indicating a need by our customers to return to surgery. We are in the early innings of commercialization of two new platforms for Intuitive, while advancing digital enablement of our ecosystem. Our teams are making good progress in all three areas. Overall, we are seeing some pandemic recovery, but improvement has been uneven with significant regional variation. Our experience shows that our business rebounds as COVID drops. Starting with procedures, general surgery in the United States was a source of strength in the quarter, driven by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and other procedures. Bariatric surgery has been on a multi-quarter gross trajectory, the result of a line development in commercial activities, starting with a capable systems, using Advanced Instruments and combined with a focused commercial team. Ventral hernia surgery is recovering with inguinal hernia tracking behind, aligned to hospital and patient prioritization. In the U.S. gynecology and urology returned to growth after pandemic-related declines. Growth in our second largest market, China, continued to be strong, with multiple specialties contributing. Lastly, procedures that have long diagnostic journeys, such as prostatectomy and thoracic surgery, remain below historical levels. Philip will take you through procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call. On the capital side, new system placements continued to exceed our expectations, with the United States, China, France and the U.K. standing out in the quarter. We know that new system placements are closely tied to anticipated procedure volumes and system utilization in mature markets. System utilization grew in the quarter on average, with significant regional variance due to pandemic differences. Overall, capital strength indicates anticipation of future procedure opportunities by our customers, a significant number systems were part of multisystem deals by hospitals and integrated delivery networks, supporting a theme in which customers who know robotic-assisted surgery well continue to invest with us. Lastly, the use of leasing and other alternative capital placement models ticked up again this quarter. Marshall will take you through capital placements in more detail later in the call. Surveying our business around the world, our business in China is growing quickly from a small base and we are pleased with the performance of our joint venture with Fosun Pharma. We believe there is significant long-term opportunity in China and remind you that it is currently a quota-controlled market. We expect China to be dynamic and competitive in coming years and we are investing in the market to bolster our place as a leading provider to the Chinese healthcare system. In Japan, growth remains healthy, although below pre-pandemic levels. In Europe, our business in France and Germany had performed well considering the pandemic. In the U.K., tightly control surgery resulted in procedure declines, but we have also seen an increased commitment to robotic-assisted surgery in the form of increased capital placements, anticipating a return of da Vinci surgery post-pandemic. Italy and Spain are rapidly returning to growth after substantial pandemic impacts. Speaking to our finances in the quarter, procedures recovered nicely in Q1. System placements came in above plan and I&A revenue per procedure was above our expectations, together driving 18% revenue growth over Q1 2020. Product gross margins were strong in the quarter, largely due to above average system ASPs, lower than expected excess and obsolescence charges, and higher volumes through our factory. Other spending was constrained in the quarter driven by three factors. First, travel and associated costs did not recur at pre-pandemic levels. This spend will increase as COVID wanes and our customers and our staff reach immunity. Second, COVID delayed some work in R&D, leading to some under spend in prototypes. We expect these programs to ramp up as COVID wanes and our labs and development programs recover efficiency. Third, we differed some investments in infrastructure that were unnecessary during the pandemic. We think most of these factors will normalize over time and we consider them one-time events related to the pandemic. We are still in the early stages of developing robotic-assisted surgery globally, and we will continue investing in R&D and our regional capabilities to realize these opportunities. As I mentioned at the start of the call, we are in the early phases of our commercialization efforts for new platforms, which we expect to play out over future quarters. Our single-port surgery platform, da Vinci SP, we performed our first cases in the U.S. and Korea of an important accessory, our SP access port, which enables surgery close to the body wall and eases assistant surgeon access through the single incision. The access port is important in the SP ecosystem, facilitating access and workflow in many procedures in which SP is used. We have had very strong customer feedback on the port to-date. We are also increasing our investments to accelerate new indications in key countries. In the U.S. we have two cleared indications for SP and expect to initiate cases as part of our colorectal IDE this quarter. We have seen strong interest in SP use in various specialties and we are in the process of designing trials for additional indications, including thoracic surgery and other surgical disciplines. Overall, we have received robust customer feedback for SP use under existing clearances. Turning to our flexible robotics platform, Ion, we installed 14 systems in the quarter. We are covering for our from our supply backlog and are meeting demand for Ion procedures at all our installed accounts, while working to fill customer inventory stocking requests and our internal inventory goals, which we expect to complete around midyear. Our PRECISE trial evaluating the ability to reach and diagnosis suspicious pulmonary legions is on track to finish enrollment by Q2 this year. Our Ion clinical performance is meeting our expectations and customer acceptance remains highly encouraging. In our digital ecosystem enablement, we broadened access to our mobile surgeon portal, the My Intuitive app this April as part of our phase launch. My Intuitive is a mobile app that allows surgeons to manage their da Vinci experience, log into da Vinci systems, manage their training and view their operative data from the palm of their hand. Our Intuitive telepresence program supported 45% of all case observations in Q1 2021, up from less than 5% a year ago, a significant achievement accelerated by the pandemic, improving convenience for our customers and reducing costs for our team. Year-over-year surgical simulation usage in the quarter grew roughly 46% over Q1 2020, validating the power of digital tools. Finally, our team made significant progress in automating customer-facing analytics as part of our robotics program consulting services, which allow our customers to analyze the relative performance of their da Vinci programs, now a routine part of customer engagement in the United States. In conclusion, we are seeing adjustments in the healthcare system that favor our offerings, increased appreciation of high quality MIS in the current and post-pandemic environment, increased openness to digital technologies, increased use of analytics to assess care and increasing sensitivity by health systems to total cost to treat. We have and will continue to position ourselves to perform well in this environment. I will now turn the time over to Marshall to take you through our financial performance in greater detail.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I would describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted to our website. Key business metrics for the first quarter were as follows. First quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 16% compared with the first quarter of 2020, was approximately the same as last quarter. On a day adjusted basis, procedures grew 18% year-over-year. First quarter system placements of 298 systems increased 26%, compared with 237 systems for the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 9%, compared with 326 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 8% to approximately 6,142 systems. This growth rate compares with 11% last year and 7% last quarter. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system increased approximately 8%, compared with last year and decreased 2% compared with last quarter. The impact of COVID on da Vinci procedures varied by region. In the U.S., COVID resurgence that affected procedures later in the fourth quarter continued well into January. Then, as COVID subsided, procedures experienced a steady improvement through February and March. In Europe, the spread of COVID varied regionally and procedure growth rates were mixed, with strength in France and a year-over-year decline in the U.K. While there have been COVID hotspots within some of our Asia-Pacific markets, they tended to be isolated, and in general, procedures performed well. China growth was far higher than other regions, reflecting the severity of the COVID impact on China in the first quarter of last year and the additional system installations over the past year. Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Despite the fact that hospitals are better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared with the outset of the pandemic, resurgences of COVID-19 and its variants like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and U.S. have challenged hospital care capabilities and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions have continued to negatively impact da Vinci procedures. While there is a backlog of patients, it is unpredictable when those patients will ultimately seek diagnosis and treatment, and whether they will be treated with surgery. Jamie will be providing procedure guidance later in this call. That guidance is based on our experience in the first quarter and the pace at which vaccines have been and are forecasted to be rolled out. Changes in the spread of COVID and its variants in the pace of vaccine rollouts could significantly impact our guidance. Moving on to capital placements, placements in the quarter reflected procedure growth, hospitals purchasing systems in preparation for a post-pandemic environment and hospitals upgrading in order to access or standardize on fourth-generation capabilities. First quarter capital placements exceeded our expectations. We believe that generally COVID has had less of an impact on hospital capital spending capacity and that customers recognize that da Vinci surgery meets their quadruple aim objectives better than other surgical approaches. Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets, to the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases. Leasing and alternative financing arrangements have enabled customer’s access to capital. We believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in a deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods. The trade-in cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending and as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total first quarter revenue was $1.292 billion, representing an 18% increase from last year and a 3% decrease from last quarter. First quarter revenue growth reflected procedure growth and higher than expected system placements. Leasing represented 43% of current quarter placements, compared with 32% last year and 37% last quarter. Leasing as a percentage of total sales has and will continue to fluctuate with core -- with customer and geographic mix. However, given hospital like -- we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. 44% of systems placed in the first quarter involve trade-ins, which is lower than the 57% last year and the 49% last quarter. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. First quarter system average selling prices increased to $1.65 million from $1.44 million last year and $1.43 million in the fourth quarter. The increase relative to last year reflects a higher mix of systems placed in China and our direct markets relative to our indirect markets, a higher mix of dual console systems and the lower proportion of trade-in transactions. The increase relative to last quarter reflects a higher mix of dual consoles and a lower proportion of trade-in transactions. We recognized $19 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter, compared with $12 million last year and $14 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure for the first quarter of $1,950 decreased compared with $1,990 per procedure for the first quarter of last year and $2,060 per procedure in the fourth quarter of 2020. Extended Use Instruments were introduced in the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter. While we saw increased usage of Extended Use Instruments in these markets, full adoption will occur over the next few quarters as customer’s burn off lower use product. In addition, we saw customers begin to adjust their instrument buying patterns to reduce their inventory levels to reflect the additional uses per instrument. Increased usage of Extended Use Instruments and customer buying patterns are the primary reasons for the decrease in instrument and accessory revenue per procedure in the first quarter relative to prior quarters. We expect this trend to continue over the next few quarters. While we expect price elasticity associated with Extended Use Instruments, to enable greater penetration into available markets, that benefit is delayed by COVID and otherwise will take time. 6% of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, reflecting a continued measured rollout of SP. Our installed base of SP systems is now 75, eight in Korea and 67 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP surgical system continues to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. We expect to initiate first cases associated with the U.S. colorectal trial in the next few months. We placed 14 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 50 systems. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. The supply issues we called out last quarter had less of an impact on Ion placements and procedures this quarter. We expect to have resolved those supply issues this quarter. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Procedures under the PRECISE study are expected to complete this quarter. Outside of the U.S., we placed 108 systems in the first quarter, compared with 55 in the first quarter of 2020 and 130 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 59 into Europe, eight into Japan and 23 into China, compared with 25 into Europe, 10 into Japan and nine into China in the first quarter of 2020. 22 systems -- 22 of the 59 systems placed in Europe this quarter were in the U.K. Placements in many markets like the U.K. can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter. While we were pleased with the performance of the U.K. team, we do not anticipate this level of placements in the U.K. in future quarters Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 71.8%, compared with 69.7% for both the first and fourth quarters of 2020. The first and fourth quarters of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. In addition, the first quarter of 2021 reflected leveraging fixed costs over higher production levels. Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter to quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. In addition, if revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor costs and under absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. COVID has impacted global supplies of semiconductors and other materials used in our products. While we carry safety stocks of critical components and are otherwise working to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, global shortages could result in higher production costs or production delays. Pro forma operating expenses increased 5% compared with the first quarter of 2020 and increased 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2020 included a $25 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation, while there were no contributions in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020. The increase compared to the prior year reflects costs associated with higher headcount and increased variable compensation, partially offset by lower spending in areas impacted by COVID. First quarter spending was below our expectations for the reasons outlined by Gary in his opening remarks. Looking to the remainder of the year, we expect spending impacted by COVID-19 including clinical development, in-person training, marketing events and travel costs to increase as COVID’s impacts decrease and spending deferred due to COVID and other timing matters to increase. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 20% meeting our expectations. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our pro forma 2020 -- our first quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $427 million or $3.52 per share, compared with $323 million or $2.69 per share for the first quarter of 2020 and $434 million or $3.58 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $426 million or $3.51 per share for the first quarter of 2021, compared with GAAP net income of $314 million or $2.62 per share for the first quarter of 2020 and GAAP net income of $365 million or $3.02 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock award, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 also included pretax gains of $4.7 million and $14.3 million on our investments in private companies resulting from our purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains net of tax was $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.09 per share in the first quarter. These gains are excluded from our pro forma results. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.2 billion, compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in cash in the first quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Philip who will go over procedure performance.
Philip Kim: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 16% year-over-year, compared to 10% growth during the first quarter of 2020 and 6% growth last quarter. Our Q1 procedure growth was driven by 14% year-over-year growth in the U.S. and 23% growth OUS. Procedures in the U.S. recovered steadily after January as COVID cases declined and the associated impact on hospital resources improved. In the U.S. within general surgery, bariatric, cholecystectomy and hernia were the largest contributors to procedure growth within the quarter. Bariatrics growth remained strong with positive customer feedback on our Advanced Instrument portfolio. Cholecystectomy growth was driven by the continued expansion of robotic procedures by general surgeons throughout their total practice. Inguinal hernia growth trailed ventral growth in the quarter. With respect to our more mature procedure categories in the U.S., Q1 gynecology procedures grew double-digit against the prior year growth comparison that was negative due to COVID. While dVP in the U.S. stabilized in Q1 from previous declines, it remains unclear when patients who have been impacted from delays in diagnosis and treatment will ultimately come back. In aggregate, on a worldwide basis, prostatectomy in the first quarter largely stabilized. More broadly OUS procedure growth was driven by urology, earlier stage growth in general surgery, gynecology and thoracic procedures. With respect to OUS markets, China procedure growth was strong and benefited from the severe first quarter of 2020 impact of COVID-19 and an increase in the installed base over the past year. China had broad-based growth in all procedure categories. In Japan, procedure growth moderated somewhat due to restrictions associated with COVID. Procedure growth in South Korea was encouraging, with SP utilization continuing to be above Xi. In Europe, France had a solid quarter, with broad-based strength in a wide range of procedure categories. The U.K. remained challenged due to COVID. Now turning to the clinical side of our business, each quarter on these calls we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. A recent article by Dr. Mohamed A Abd El Aziz, Fabian Grass and David Larson with colleagues from the Mayo Clinic published in Surgical Endoscopy provided results from a real world study aimed to analyze national trends of conversion during elective colectomies in addition to MIS utilization trends. Using the ATF national surgical quality improvement program database for elective laparoscopic or robotic-assisted colectomy between January 2013 and December 2018, a total of 66,652 patients were identified. Overall conversion rates from MIS to open were approximately 42% lower for robotic-assisted procedures when compared to laparoscopic procedures, 4.9% versus 8.5%. The rate was also lower for obese patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 30, 6% versus 10.3%. The authors concluded in part, quote, this large scale study identified a decreasing trend in conversion rates over the six-year inclusion period, both overall and in patients with obesity paralleling increased utilization of the robotics platform. Given the potential negative impact of conversion on patient outcomes, individual institutions should consider a review of their own conversion data, as this may represent an opportunity for quality improvement, unquote. In February of this year, Dr. Amir Bastawrous of the Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle Washington and Dr. Robert Cleary of St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, published a real-world observational study, which compared the rates of long-term opioid prescriptions for patients who underwent minimally invasive and open colectomies. This study utilized the IBM market scan research database and analyzed 14,887 eligible patients who underwent the colon resection via the open laparoscopic or robotic-assisted approach between 2013 and 2017. In the one-to-one propensity score matched analysis comparing the MIS and open approaches with over 5,000 patients in each arm, the MIS approach has significantly lower incident rates of long-term prescriptions of any opioid by approximately 36%, 13.3% versus 20.9%, Schedule 2 and 3opioids by approximately 39%, 11.7% versus 19.2%, and high-dose opioids by approximately 44%, 4.3% versus 7.7% from 90 days to 180 days postoperatively. Looking at the matched analysis between robotic-assisted surgery and laparoscopy with overall 1,100 subjects in each group, the robotic-assisted approach demonstrated approximately 45% lower long-term prescription rates of high-dose opioids, 2.1% versus 3.8% when compared to the laparoscopic approach. Furthermore, in subgroup analyses, the robotic-assisted approach showed significant lower rates of long-term prescriptions in any opioids, Schedule 2 and 3 opioids, and high-dose opioids compared to the laparoscopic approach for subjects undergoing a colectomy for nonmalignant conditions. The authors concluded in part, quote, choosing an MIS option in robotic-assisted surgery for some colorectal operations is a modifiable factor that may contribute to less long-term opioid use, unquote. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Jamie who will review our financial outlook.
Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. While there continues to be uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of COVID-19, given moderating COVID-19 hospitalization trends and vaccination progress particularly in the U.S. which accounted for approximately 70% of our 2020 procedures, we are reestablishing our financial guidance. In providing this guidance, we know that there are emerging supply constraints in our supply chain, for example, in the semiconductor industry. The outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to the supply constraints. Our financial outlook for 2021 is as follows. Starting with procedures, total 2020 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 1% to roughly 1,243,000 procedures performed worldwide. For 2021, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 22% to 26%. We expect 2021 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside the United States where we were at earlier stages of adoption. The high end of the range assumes that COVID cases and their impact on da Vinci procedures to continue to decline throughout the year, the vaccine rollouts continue at the level currently expected by governments around the world and that recovery of patient backlogs will progress. Modeling quarterly results is difficult, given the impact that COVID had on 2020 procedures. Therefore, with respect to seasonality, we expect similar quarterly patterns to 2019. With respect to capital, system placements are generally driven by procedure demand, prompting hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. System placement demand is also the result of customers standardizing our fourth generation technology through trade-ins. Capital sales can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including government healthcare policies, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Within this framework, we expect 2021 capital placements to generally be driven by procedures and the adequacy of existing capacity in the installed base. During the first quarter of 2021, 43% of system shifts were under operating leases. We expect that the proportion of systems placed under operating leases will vary from quarter-to-quarter and could continue to trend up in the future. Turning to gross profit, our full year 2020 pro forma gross profit margin was 68.4%, reflecting the impact of fixed -- higher fixed overhead costs relative to revenue, higher excess and obsolete inventory charges and the customer relief program that was implemented in the second quarter of 2020. Our full year 2019 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.7%. In 2021, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix, the impact of current cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies and competitive pricing pressure. With respect to operating expenses, in 2019, our pro forma operating expenses grew 27%, and in 2020, given the impact of the pandemic they grew 3%. In 2021, we expect pro forma full-year operating expense growth to be between 18% and 22%, reflecting increases in investments in our digital ecosystem, Ion, SP, OUS expansion, higher regulatory-related costs and infrastructure investments to allow us to scale. 2021 spending also expected to be impacted by a return over the course of the year to higher rates of travel, increased customer training and a greater proportion of marketing events being held in-person and by a variable compensation. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $450 million and $470 million in 2021, compared to $396 million in 2020. We expect pro forma other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $45 million and $55 million in 2021, reflecting lower interest rates relative to 2020. With regard to income tax, in 2020, our pro forma income tax rate was 22.5%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2021 pro forma tax rate to be between 20% and 21% of pretax income. Our 2021 outlook for the pro forma tax rate does not reflect any potential change in U.S. tax rates. That concludes our prepared comments and we will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First, we are going to the line of Amit Hazan. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Thanks very much. Can you hear me okay?
Gary Guthart: We can.
Amit Hazan: Great. I will maybe burn the first question on just the guide. Obviously appreciate that just given all the uncertainty on the procedure side. And so given that you gave that number, we will see if you would go a step further and just give us a little bit more color as to how you got there. We are obviously all kind of trying to figure out recovery back to normal, but also these potential buckets of recapturing backlog of procedure categories for you, particularly in prostate I’d suspect. Can you just talk to how you thought about those backlog of patients and that return to normal as you developed this guide for the rest of the year on the procedure side?
Jamie Samath: Yeah. So maybe I will start with -- this is Jamie. I will start with the low end of the procedure guidance. So we considered three factors in the low end. We see the possibility of extended impact of COVID in certain OUS geographies, with slower vaccine rollouts and resurgences in some of these geographies. We see that in parts of Europe currently. Secondly, we embedded in the lower end of the procedure guidance a slower recovery of diagnostic pipelines that have been impacted during the pandemic. And then the third item in the low end of the guidance is the possibility of regionalized resurgence of COVID in the U.S. as we race towards the rollout of vaccines and ultimately at some point achieve herd immunity in the U.S. With respect to the backlog, the backlog has accumulated really for three factors, lower diagnostic pipelines, deferred elective surgery as hospital systems get inundated with COVID cases and patient reluctance to undergo surgery during COVID resurgences. These subcomponents we think get recovered over different periods of time. The backlog is actually constantly netting between increases and recovery. So the total accumulated backlog is difficult to predict. The rate of recovery is also difficult to predict, but we expect it to go through into 2022. And so -- the 2021 procedure guidance that we provided reflects our best estimate of the range of the impact of backlog in the year.
Amit Hazan: Okay. I appreciate that. And I want to come back with the second question just to a topic that’s been discussed before, but I figured in light of COVID to bring it up again, which is just this question of ambulatory surgery centers and lower acuity procedures generally. I mean, especially given COVID, it just seems like there’s just never been more of an optimal time for Intuitive to discuss and go after this part of the market? And we still don’t hear you talking about it that much. It just -- it begs the question of what’s holding you back and we know that the reflex answers -- reflex kind of answer seemed to be on the reimbursement side and that it may not be optimal. When I think about your advantages that you pitch to hospitals on the marketing side, the surgeon benefit, frankly the outcomes, that seems to be a lot more important and potentially beneficial than wherever reimbursement lies. So help us out here. Why are ambulatory surgery centers not a bigger opportunity for you right now?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. This is Gary. We are already in ambulatory surgery environments with our customers, different types and we see healthy programs there. I don’t think we are struggling from the point of view of having a product that can help them or services that can help them or a way to have a conversation. I think all those things are in place. I do believe that over time reimbursement matters, particularly in customers that operate in both environments, hospitals and ASCs. For them, reimbursement matters. If they are going to move a patient, but they get a big difference in the revenue, then they are going to make those decisions. It may change over time and that what payers ultimately decide to do and whether they want to create some incentives to help things move into ASCs, we will be ready. Long-term, I am bullish on that. I think the environment makes sense, but economics and incentives really matter. It doesn’t clear up your question, it reinforces our position.
Amit Hazan: Okay. Thank you for that. I will step back in queue.
Operator: Thank you. And next we will go to the line of Larry Biegelsen. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, can you please provide more color on the Intuitive telepresence feature that you mentioned on this call? It’s the first time I’d heard you talk about it and that 45% of procedures was a pretty impressive number. Is that through your agreement with InTouch? How is it being used by customers? What are the benefits And how do you see that playing out post-COVID And I have one follow-up?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. So, you are right, it is the result of the technology and a collaborative agreement we signed with InTouch many years ago. We brought a team over, as well as some of the technology and have put it in our hands. The use case I was talking about there is the ability for people who are interested in observing a case by an expert to log in online through a secure network, high speed streaming and view that case on da Vinci accounts. And that’s an important part of both knowledge transfer from those high volume accounts, as well as an introductory exposure for surgeons who are thinking about it. So that has been great. There are other use cases for streaming connections, video streaming connections, into our products that I won’t detail now. It’s pretty neat and so prior we had started that, I was a believer, or we as a company were believers that those kinds of access, think of it as kind of surgical FaceTime or surgical Skype over a distance. That kind of access would be important to folks, and the pandemic really accelerated it. So we had the technology infrastructure in place and as people started to be more open to the use of digital tools to do their learning and exposure and wanted to stay off of planes and out of cars, we saw it really accelerate and that’s what we have been touching on there.
Larry Biegelsen: That’s very helpful. And then lastly, what response are you getting from the Extended Use Program you introduced in Q4 2020, any changes to kind of the impact that we could see from that and any color yet on demand elasticity? Thanks for taking the questions.
Marshall Mohr: Yeah. Sure. So we introduced Extended Use Instruments into Europe and into the U.S. in Q4. We did see increased usage of Extended Use Instruments. They still have some level of inventory of shorter life used instruments and they are burning that off. We also had commented last quarter that we saw stocking orders of Extended Use Instruments and we are seeing some adjustment of their buying patterns to recognize the increased number of uses per instrument. So, this quarter, as I called out, instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was lower than last quarter and that primarily reflects those factors, like the turn of use of Extended Instruments and adjustments of inventory buying patterns. I don’t think it’s exhausted the whole impact and 130 if you go back to our previous script, you see that we said that had you implemented this in 2019, it would have affected total revenue by about $150 million to $170 million or about 7% of INA per procedure and we have only seen a part of that so far. When the rest of it will hit is questionable. It will roll out over time as they continue to use those instruments and as we roll it out to other countries.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks, Marshall.
Operator: Thank you. And next we are going to the line of Bob Hopkins. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Thank you and good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question or a few questions on just the first quarter procedure volume numbers that you provided, because it was obviously a lot stronger than consensus estimates. And so, Gary, I was just wondering, a couple quick things. Is it safe to assume that the end of the quarter was materially stronger than the beginning and middle of the quarter in terms of procedure growth? And then I was just wondering what stood out to you, Gary, either geographically or by procedure type in the quarter that you think is worth calling out?
Gary Guthart: To your -- thanks for the question. To the first one, we definitely saw growth through the quarter, which was encouraging. In terms of procedure types, I think, there’s this interesting mix, the prioritization that folks are making as they come back into hospitals. I think is a mixture of patient desire depending on what they think their condition might be, for example bariatrics, and the hospital and surgeons prioritization around urgency, for example diagnosed cancers and changes that are challenges to the diagnostic pipeline. I was pleased by U.S. general surgery. I think that that has shown some resilience, a lot of that is benign procedures and I think that that has been kind of on the upside of our models. So so far so good.
Bob Hopkins: And then one follow-up just on that also to get a little bit of a better flavor for procedure volumes in the quarter by geography, I am just curious on Europe, what’s your take on, how bad are things there in your view and just curious maybe how far below 16% was Europe in the quarter?
Gary Guthart: I won’t quantify it for you but just to give you a little bit of qualitative color and Marshall, please jump in and help. In the U.K., we have seen NHS make priority decisions firmly and that reflects what we see in the procedure performance itself, which has been suppressed. That said, we are also seeing commitments to MIS in the form of capital acquisition and other things that indicate to us that they are rotating toward it. So there is kind of a mixed conversation. France and Germany have been surprisingly good despite complexity with regard to the way COVID is rolling out. And then as we look at Spain and Italy, we see it really just follow as COVID eases surgery comes back and we come back with it. Overall, we feel like we have really good leadership teams in place in country. We feel like we are in good connection with the healthcare systems. I think we are being agile and adaptable to meet their needs, which is really controlling what we can control. And in that sense, I think the company is doing all right. Marshall, anything you would add?
Marshall Mohr: I think that was great color. I think the only other thing I would add is the, we have talked about in the past that a lot of the procedures we are performing are urologic and we are in the process in certain countries of pivoting. And we are starting to see some adoption in GYN and general surgeries in some countries but we still have work to do.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next we are going to the line of Tycho Peterson. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Hey. Thanks. A couple follow-ups. I am curious what’s baked into guidance on utilization given the Extended Use Instruments in the commentary before. What are you kind of modeling for utilization for the year?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I think I would refer, Tycho, back to 2019 patterns in terms of utilization. Obviously, we knew capital was going to be driven by procedure performance. So I think I would just refer to seasonal patterns in 2019 as a starting point.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then you have commented a couple times on this call and other calls on the diagnostic pipelines being under pressure. Can you just talk a little bit about how are they are looking as a leading indicator to some of the more mature procedures, dVP in particular?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Jamie, why don’t you jump in?
Jamie Samath: Yeah. We have -- so we have some market data actually for the U.S. What we see is -- and that’s through February 2021, what we see is most of the diagnostic tests, PSA testing, for example, CT scans and lung cancer. We see that those have been suppressed during this period. So we haven’t seen them start to recover at least in the data that we have seen so far. And we see that reasonably correlated to the associated procedures, so PSA dVP has been relatively weak during that period, so as lobectomy. So so far we haven’t seen any evidence of a recovery in diagnostic testing at least in the U.S.
Gary Guthart: There are some anecdotes that it’s starting to get better in March. We will see as it plays out. Even after the diagnostic gets done there is a workup pipeline that has to be done. That said, I don’t feel like we have any evidence that it’s moving away from surgery. So it appears in those kind of cases that it’s building a backlog that ultimately will flow through. If PSA testing back in 2012 is a guide, it will take several quarters for that to work its way out.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then last one on SP, two quick ones actually. Can you confirm you started the IDE trial for colorectal in the quarter? And then, Gary, you mentioned thoracic surgery and other disciplines, I am just curious if you could talk a little bit about the roadmap other areas you might go after with SP?
Gary Guthart: Sure. On the SP side, on the IDEs, the first cases are scheduled. We have got all the paperwork done in our research institutions that we are working through, at least the first starting ones and we expect that to happen. The first cases have not yet gone through. They should have it here in the next few weeks. Thoracic, that’s the first time we been telling you that we think that’s interesting. There are single port opportunities for thoracic surgery and we are excited by them. We are working through what those trials look like and having conversations with regulatory bodies to get it going and given the current environment, we will have concurrent trials for the colorectal and then thoracic. There are a couple more indications beyond that. For competitive and other reasons, we are not yet ready to guess what those are going to be for us. But SP is a platform, and we are excited by it. So as we get closer and those things get closer to being filed as IDEs and trials then we will describe them more fully.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next we are going to the line of Rick Wise. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Good afternoon, everybody. I was hoping we could talk a little bit more, Gary, about Ion. We would get a bunch of physician calls a month or so ago and heard really fantastic feedback that doctors are telling us about early signs of higher diagnostic yields, best in complex cases, noticeable functional benefits and features. All that left me optimistic about the PRECISE trial. So a couple things, are you optimistic and hopeful about PRECISE? I think you said it would be wrapped up -- I just want to make sure I understand by midyear. When might we see the data, all the docs are anxious to see the data? And with some of the logistical issues resolved, could we, should we expect an acceleration, is it reasonable to think about anticipate the acceleration Ion uptake in the second half and into 2022? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Sure. On the issue of the PRECISE trial, Philip, I will turn to you in terms of timing.
Philip Kim: Sure. So we confirmed that we expect enrollment to end this quarter in Q2 and then you would have final data readout in the back half of next year, 2022.
Gary Guthart: On the issue of, you had said, how are we feeling about it. I think we are reading and hearing what you are reading and hearing also in terms of talking to our customer about the ability of Ion to deliver on its promises, to reach into the lung to get to diagnostic yields that folks have not seen with other technologies and to work in complex cases. So I am feeling enthusiastic and bullish on it. With regard to ramp, we are expecting Ion to continue to ramp through the year and into next year. I don’t see a step function change. I think it’s a sequential ramp as we go and that’s because it’s been interesting and sophisticated technology. So a lot of what we are working on is making sure that we can get the manufacturability to where we need it, getting supply chain stability, quality and predictability where we need it, iterating our design for manufacturing and working on additional indications because it’s a platform and we are doing all four of those things. But I don’t think investors, because of the way these things work, should expect that you flip a switch and it just goes to the next level. I think that it will climb each quarter and that’s what we are working on. That beats our expectation and our experience in these kind of function.
Rick Wise: Thanks very much.
Gary Guthart: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And next we are going to the line of Richard Newitter. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on operating expense guidance. Thanks for the full year outlook. Just could you give us an extent of the quarterly pacing or would it be safe to assume the 2019 cadence commentary for procedures applies to OpEx too?
Marshall Mohr: Yeah. I think you should see sequentially operating expenses generally increase across the rest of the year. It’s really going to be a function of the extent to which COVID continues to impact our ability to travel, accelerate customer training and hold marketing events in person. But generally, I would expect it to radically increase across the balance of the year.
Richard Newitter: Got it. And just same kind of topic here, on geographic investment and expansion that you started to get more aggressive on pre-pandemic, especially in India, just in light of what’s been going on in that region specifically with the COVID problem. Should we be thinking of some of those initiatives postponed even further out to 2022 and beyond or are those things that could resume as early as this year? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I am sorry. I had a little bit of a hard time hearing you with regard to the referenced trial. So go ahead and re-ask the question, if you would.
Richard Newitter: Sorry. My connection is off. But just India, should we think of reinvestment in that region starting now or in light of COVID and the situation there something 2022 and beyond? Is that part of the spending and geographic expansion you referred today?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. So with regard to India, clearly, the current situation there is such that current procedures are impacted. That said, I think that the long-term commitment we have to market is intact. Our teams are making really nice progress building a footprint in relationships to hospital systems. And so I expect as COVID starts to become managed there a little bit more forcefully and it starts to recover we will see a recovery on our side. It has not had a retreat. Other places around the world, whether it’s Japan or China or Europe, we continue to be interested and committed, so not just India, but others as well. And if you have just asked your last question then we will go from there. Rich, any follow-ups or Operator, one more question please.
Operator: Okay. Next we are going to the line of Matt Taylor. Please go ahead.
Matt Taylor: Hi. Yeah. Thank you very much for taking the question. I guess it was good to see the strong return of capital spending. You are talking about customers looking forward to prepare for volumes and commitment to robotic surgeries. Do you think that there was a little bit of a bolus of kind of pent-up spending that came through in Q1 or do you think this is the start of a new pattern of purchasing based on your backlog and what you are seeing with your orders?
Gary Guthart: That is a subject of fearsome debate amongst us as a company. Marshall, why don’t you share your opinion?
Marshall Mohr: Well, I give you a few different dynamics to consider as we go forward. It’s always hard to project out based on one quarter results. I guess we have had a couple quarters that have been decent. Is there -- was there -- I think part of your question was, is there pent-up spending? I would just say, I don’t know if it was pent-up spending, but I would say, that clearly the hospitals had more capital to spend than we had anticipated. And as a -- and what’s really driving them, their spending on da Vinci procedure -- on da Vinci capital is procedure growth. Procedure growth is the number one thing that drives capital. But also the trade-in cycle and the desire to access fourth generation product, including the Extended Use Instruments we mentioned earlier. And then, finally, I think that, you also have them getting ready for the post-pandemic environment and just a general recognition that da Vinci Surgery meets their quadruple aim objectives better than other approaches now.
Matt Taylor: Great. Okay, guys. Thanks. I will leave it there. Appreciate it.
Gary Guthart: All right. Well, thank you. Okay. Well, that was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there’s a substantial and durable opportunity of fundamentally improved surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It follows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their need and their environments. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-21 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience and holding, and welcome to the Intuitive Fourth Quarter of 2020 Earnings Release. At this time, all of your participant phone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Just a brief reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. Now, I’m happy to turn the conference over to Head of Investor Relations, Philip Kim.
Philip Kim: Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive’s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks or uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 7, 2020, and Form 10-Q filed on October 19, 2020. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC’s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today’s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our financial results. Then, I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter capped the year in which the pandemic challenged our customers and our business. It highlighted some core strengths for the company, introduced some obstacles to overcome and triggered some changes for us. To put the year and quarter in context, let me first review some of the numbers. Procedures grew 6% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 1% for the full-year over 2019, resulting in approximately 1.25 million procedures in 2020. We placed 326 systems in the quarter, down from 336 systems in Q4 of 2019. For the full-year, we placed 936 systems in 2020, down from 1,119 systems in 2019. Finally, revenue fell 3% in 2020 as the result of delays in surgical procedures, as hospitals focused on treating COVID patients. Digging a little deeper, our core business remains healthy. After the first surge of COVID abated during this past summer, our customers returned to more routine use of our systems and solutions. We believe that the Intuitive ecosystem enabled increased access to and practice of high-quality minimally invasive surgery, which may have helped hospitals conserve valuable intensive care resources during the pandemic. Despite pressure on utilization of our systems due to COVID, our hospital customers continued to invest in building their Intuitive's robotics programs with additional systems, evidenced by a 7% increase in the clinical installed base in 2020. We saw committed customers strengthening their programs, likely due to their analysis of how well the Intuitive ecosystem satisfied their quadruple aim objectives, better outcomes, better care team experiences, better patient experiences, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. Lastly, we believe our investments in our analytics programs have helped customers routinely analyze their performance, supporting their programmatic insights in the year. Our confidence in our core business and our long-term opportunity remains robust, in spite of near-term uncertainty, which is as follows. First, the pandemic is resurgent in many regions, powered now by more contagious variants. While hospitals have better protocols to manage patients today than they did earlier in 2020, our weekly surgical data in December 2020 and continuing today shows another clamp down on surgeries. Furthermore, we believe diagnostic procedures are slowing in hard hit regions. With diagnostic procedures running significantly below pre-pandemic levels, patients and hospitals will acutely feel the impact through disease progression and the more complex therapies necessary when patients do return for care. This delay in diagnostic pipelines will likely take several quarters to resolve, even after the threat of COVID begins to abate. Second, we know that future of new capital installs are highly sensitive to utilization rates. Delayed surgeries will also impact the growth of surgical departments, pressuring new system installs until excess capacity is consumed. Third, in countries where the government pays the healthcare bill, budget strain and economic fallout from COVID may impact health care spending in new and variable ways in different countries. Lastly, the trend that started prior to the pandemic for increased data requirements and longer clearance time lines from regulators in the United States and Europe for our industry has continued this year. Taken together, these obstacles make predictions for the next several quarters difficult. As I mentioned earlier, 2020 has broadly eliminated some longer-term trends in health-care that validate our thesis. The increased pressure on healthcare systems to conserve acute care resources for the sickest patients may have accelerated investments that enable patients to get the care they need with fast recovery, minimizing consumption of scarce hospital resources and reducing complications. The compounding value of analyzing real-time data and offline healthcare data to drive insights, to drive better care has become obvious this year. Lastly, we saw an acceleration of remote technology used to enable proctoring, learning and analysis. I've heard it said that in good times, we develop ourselves to become who we want to be while hard times reveal who we really are. In the year, we set our priorities based on our values. We implemented community relief and customer relief, launched our Extended Use Instruments program, mobilized local and remote training resources to support customers differently and continued to listen carefully to our customers to best understand their needs. We've seen positive customer response to this approach, which is reflected in our Net Promoter Score. You can find more information on these scores in our JPMorgan Healthcare Conference presentation from this month, posted on our website. Over the past several years, we've been building our capabilities in different countries to better serve their healthcare systems. I'd like to take a moment to take you through how we performed outside the United States in the year. Turning first to Asia. Our business in Japan is moving beyond urology, given reimbursements for a broad slate of procedures obtained in Japan in 2018 and 2020. Government hospitals in Japan have been conserving resources for COVID care and the pandemic has introduced noticeable delays as the healthcare system reacts to outbreaks. In Korea, our business continues to be dynamic with an innovation-oriented customer group adopting new products like our da Vinci SP. In China, we saw accelerated customer acceptance of our partnership with Fosun Pharma and our products, with growth in procedures and the business overall outpacing our pre-pandemic plans. In 2020, China emerged as our number two procedure market. Turning to Europe. Our team in Germany has had success in engaging larger German hospital groups with increased system placements broadening our market access. Constraints on elective surgery have been implemented assertively in Germany in light of COVID. In Germany, France, UK, Italy and the Nordics, our goals have been to broaden da Vinci use beyond urology. Progress therein has been hampered significantly by COVID. Lastly, we see relatively low public sector reimbursements in Europe for benign procedures. Innovations from Intuitive like da Vinci S and our Extended Use Instruments are providing an option for more price sensitive customers in these markets. With regard to our innovation and product engines, we spent time walking through our progress at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference this month and our presentation is available online at our website, intuitive.com. I'd recommend to the interested listener a review of those materials for greater insight into our progress. Summarizing briefly here, we're making good progress in advancing many elements of our ecosystem, including our advanced instruments, deepening our imaging and informatics programs, including our augmented reality program, Iris, and extending the launches of our new platforms. We grew the installed base in procedures for our single port platform, da Vinci SP. We're focused on advancing clinical indications for SP in several regions, as well as extending its instrument and accessory portfolio. For our flexible robotics platform, Ion, we saw strong clinical results and demand in the year, but met manufacturing and supply performance challenges in the fourth quarter as catheter demand outpaced our forecasting models and the need for important quality improvement implementations and COVID quarantines hampered our production. We are currently shipping Ion product and expect to meet the demand curve in the first-half of 2021. Before Marshall takes you through our finances in detail, I'd like to touch on our financial strategy. Our operating model withstood the strains of 2020 well, starting with our decision several years ago to shift to greater flexibility in system placement models, the incorporation of sales, leasing and risk-shared models allowed us to meet customers' needs during a disruptive time. Our investments in advanced instruments, including stapling and energy have been fruitful with growing revenues, improving margins and growing customer appreciation for advanced instruments. We've been investing capital in our manufacturing methods to increase quality and lower our costs, which in turn has allowed us to extend savings to our customers to allow them greater flexibility and deploying our products in more cost-sensitive environments. This has triggered a virtuous cycle that allows us greater volume, which in turn gives us greater ability to invest in higher-volume processes. We'll continue to invest in this cycle going forward. We believe we are still in the early innings of a long opportunity to substantially improve the quadruple aim and acute medical interventions using robotics, computing, advanced imaging and informatics. As a result, we continue to invest in our innovation engines to create and pursue these opportunities. In closing, our priorities for 2021 are as follows. First, we'll support our customers' recovery of surgery during and post pandemic. Second, we'll focus on outstanding regional performance. Third, we'll advance our priority programs and launches, SP, Ion, imaging and analytics, including new indications. And finally, continued expansion of clinical, economic and analytical evidence base for key procedures and countries. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I’ll describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Revenue and procedures are consistent with our preliminary press release of January 13th. Key business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows. Fourth quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased approximately 10% compared with last quarter. Fourth quarter system placements of 326 systems decreased 3% compared with 336 systems last year and increased 67% compared with 195 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over last year by 7% to approximately 5,989 systems. This growth rate compares with 8% in the last quarter and 12% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, declined approximately 2% compared with last year and increased 8% compared with last quarter. The impact of COVID on da Vinci procedures varied by region. Resurgence of COVID in parts of Europe had significant impacts on procedures, including in Italy, UK, Nordics and France. While the impact of COVID on procedures in the Asia Pacific region, including China, Japan and Korea, was far less significant. In the U.S., fourth quarter procedure growth was impacted by the COVID’s resurgence, resulting in 5% year-over-year growth compared to 7% growth in the third quarter. The resurgence in U.S. and Europe was more acute and had a greater impact on procedures late in the quarter, a trend that continued into January. The impact of a resurgence can be significant. For example, in California, the fourth quarter COVID resurgence turned a year-over-year da Vinci procedure growth in October of 8% to a year-over-year decline of 6% in December. We also believe that reduced diagnosis reflecting patient concern over COVID exposure has impacted certain procedures globally. This has had its most pronounced effect on prostatectomies. Despite the fact that hospitals are better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared to the outset of the pandemic, COVID-19 resurgences like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and the U.S. have challenged hospital care capabilities and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions will also continue to negatively impact da Vinci procedures. Uncertainties in this COVID environment are not predictable, and the vaccine rollout and its impact on controlling COVID spread is also not predictable. Given these uncertainties, we are not providing procedure guidance at this time. Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Fourth quarter capital placements exceeded our expectations, reflecting several factors. In certain cases, hospitals exhausted 2020 budgets and spend capacities. And in some cases, hospitals purchased systems in preparation for post-pandemic environment. We also experienced a higher level of trade-ins of SI systems for fourth generation systems, reflecting hospital desire to standardize their fleet and to avail themselves to fourth generation technology and lower cost Extended Use Instruments. Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue headwinds. Utilization declined 2% year-over-year, resulting in excess system capacity at hospitals. We expect customers to fill existing system capacity before purchasing additional capital. Some of the fourth quarter capital placements reflected hospitals exhausting 2020 budgets. As budgets reset for 2021, hospitals could reduce their capital spend, particularly as COVID strains hospital profitability. We expect leasing to continue to increase as a percentage of overall placements. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could also impact hospital capital spending. And as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total fourth quarter revenue was $1,329 million, representing a 4% increase from last year and a 23% increase from last quarter. Fourth quarter revenue benefited from U.S. customer stocking of Extended Use Instruments and higher than expected system placements. Leasing represented 37% of current quarter placements compared with 35% last quarter. Fourth quarter placements included some larger IDN transactions where the IDN prefers purchase transactions. Excluding those transactions, leasing as a percentage of total placements would have been several percentage points higher. In an environment of COVID-19 as economic pressures increase, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. Approximately half of the systems placed in the fourth quarter involve trade-ins, which is higher than the 40% last quarter and higher than the average over the last couple of years. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. Fourth quarter average selling prices declined to $1.43 million from $1.61 million last year and $1.55 million in the third quarter. The decrease relative to last year reflects a lower mix of systems placed in China and Japan and a higher proportion of trade transactions. The decrease relative to last quarter reflects a higher proportion of trade-in transactions and a higher mix of indirect market placements. We recognized $14 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $34 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure increased to approximately $2,060 per procedure compared with $1,910 per procedure in the third quarter of 2020 and $1,980 realized in the fourth quarter of last year. The entirety of the increase compared to the third quarter reflects U.S. hospital stocking Extended Use Instruments. We launched Extended Use Instruments early in the quarter in the U.S. and mid-quarter in Europe. We will launch Extended Use Instruments in other markets in 2021 and 2022, depending on regulatory requirements. Going forward, we expect customers to adjust their instrument buying patterns and reduce their inventory levels to reflect the additional uses per instrument. In addition, Extended Use Instruments and lower instrument pricing will result in lower I&A revenue per procedure to Intuitive. The impact and timing of customer buying patterns and lower per use revenue will likely begin to impact revenues in the first quarter, but will depend on customer inventory practices and procedure volumes. While we expect price elasticity associated with Extended Use Instruments to enable greater penetration into available markets, that benefit will be delayed by COVID and otherwise will take time. 12 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were SP systems, reflecting continued measured rollout of SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our installed base of SP systems is now 69, 8 in Korea and 61 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP surgical system will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. We expect to initiate first cases associated with a U.S. colorectal clinical trial this quarter. We placed four Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 36 systems. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. Ion system placements were affected by supply chain issues described by Gary earlier in the call. We expect to remediate these supply issues in the first half of 2021. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Procedures under the PRECISE study are expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021. Outside the U.S., we placed 130 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 140 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 79 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe, 22 into Japan and 13 into China compared with 54 into Europe, 26 into Japan and 39 into China in the fourth quarter of 2019. System placements into China in the fourth quarter of 2019 were higher as hospitals accelerated tenders in anticipation of the possibility of higher tariffs. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 69.7% compared with 72.2% for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 70.2% last quarter. The fourth quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 reflects higher period costs associated with lower production, higher excess and obsolete inventory charges and lower system ASPs. As revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor costs and under-absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. In addition, product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and could cause fluctuations in gross margins. Pro forma operating expenses decreased 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased 11% compared with the third quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2020 includes a $25 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation compared with a $5 million contribution in the fourth quarter of 2019 and no contribution last quarter. Fourth quarter operating expenses continued to reflect reduced spending on activities directly impacted by COVID-19, including marketing events, travel and in-person training as well as lower variable compensation. These costs will naturally increase as the impact of COVID declines. We continue to believe we have a unique opportunity to extend the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world, and we'll continue to invest in the business for the long term. During this period of COVID, we continue to invest in product development activities, including informatics, advanced imaging, advanced instruments and our Ion and SP platforms. Accordingly, you should expect the growth rate of R&D expenses in 2021 to significantly exceed the 2020 growth rate. We expect the growth rate of SG&A expenses to also increase significantly in 2021 compared to 2020. SG&A spending can be categorized as follows. Investments in OUS markets will increase over 2020 spend as we expand our capabilities and investment in clinical data. Variable compensation will increase over 2020 as we reset goals and targets. Core spending on resources and infrastructure will increase over 2020 to prepare for a post-COVID environment. Spend on activities impacted by COVID, like travel, marketing events and in-person training will increase as the impact of COVID declines. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.7% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%, primarily reflecting the geographic mix of income. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items. Our fourth quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $436 million or $3.58 per share compared with $426 million or $3.48 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 and $341 million or $2.77 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $364 million or $3.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with GAAP net income of $363 million or $2.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $317 million or $2.60 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles, and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and third quarters of 2020 also included pretax gains of $4.7 million and $61.7 million on our investments in private entities, resulting from our purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains net of tax was $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.39 per share in the third quarter. These gains are excluded from our pro forma results. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.9 billion compared with $6.4 billion at September 30, 2020 and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash in the fourth quarter reflected cash from operations, a reduction in inventory and overall working capital and stock exercises. We repurchased $34 million of shares in the quarter with an average price of -- at an average price of $661.10 per share. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over our procedure performance.
Philip Kim: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was 6% compared to 19% growth during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 7% growth last quarter. Our Q4 procedure growth was driven by 5% growth in the U.S. and 11% growth OUS. Resurgences of COVID in the U.S. and Europe impacted our growth rates in the quarter, and we saw procedure growth rates decline as the quarter progressed, particularly late in the quarter. With respect to key contributors to growth, overall procedures in China and bariatrics in the U.S. were the largest drivers of procedure growth in Q4. In the U.S., within general surgery, bariatric, cole and hernia were the largest contributors to procedure growth within the quarter. Bariatrics may be benefiting from certain patients prioritizing weight loss as obesity is a significant COVID risk factor. In addition, we continue to receive positive reviews of our SureForm 60 stapler, which provides surgeons an optimized robotic tool set and feedback for bariatric procedures. In China, procedure growth accelerated as new systems installed under the quota began to provide additional capacity for incremental growth. Q4 China procedures had broad-based growth in urology, thoracic, general surgery and gynecology. With respect to our more mature procedure categories in the U.S., Q4 gynecology procedure growth was up, reflecting growth in cancer procedures, partially offset by declines in benign procedures. On a worldwide basis, dVP procedures in the fourth quarter declined year-over-year and had similar trends as we described last quarter. COVID is impacting the diagnostic and patient pipeline related to dVP. Now, turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain republished studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Doctors Clark A. Wilson and Jihad Kaouk from the Cleveland Clinic and colleagues in a paper published in Urology described their experience evaluating robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with da Vinci SP through an extraperitoneal approach and enhanced recovery protocol for same-day surgery. 60 subjects with organ confined disease underwent an SP procedure with no patients requiring conversion to another approach. Median length of stay for all patients was 4.2 hours. 75% of all patients enrolled were discharged on the day of surgery and 96% of patients discharged within 24 hours, when excluding those either with surgery after 6:00 p.m. or with preplanned admissions due to patient preference or significant comorbidities. The authors concluded a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with the da Vinci SP system and extraperitoneal approach can be performed safely and reproducibly as the same-day surgery. This publication adds to the number of early studies around the emerging SP technology, demonstrating encouraging results within robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy as a same-day surgery and acceptable, perioperative, functional and short-term oncological outcomes in the hands of experienced surgeons for the appropriate patients. We look forward to the growth of the body of evidence around da Vinci SP. Lastly, we'd like to highlight that our second annual sustainability report will be available after the call on our Investor Relations website. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First, we go to the line of Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Amit Hazan: Thanks very much. Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I thought maybe I'd first go to your comments in general on hospital capital spending and maybe try to reconcile some of them. I think, if you go back to last week, you cited hospitals with seven-plus systems were up strongly. And here, you're still citing lower utilization as the key headwind. And so, I'm just wondering, are you otherwise seeing a skewing towards newer customers, and just trying to get my hands around. I have to imagine it's complicated and hospital systems are different, but how much more color you can provide around kind of some of these different data points that you've provided?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. I think I just -- go ahead.
Gary Guthart: Why don't I jump in, Marshall, and then, I'll kick it back to you? Amit, thanks for the question. We were talking about earlier in the month here. We think there's some budget flushing that happened at the end of 2020. How strong that will be into 2021? Did they pull forward spending that would otherwise normally have been in 2021? Hard to say. Having said that, if you look at where we were winning relative to other priorities, even if there is some budget pull forward, large customers were -- that already had robotics programs were expressing confidence with us, which we think is a positive. The caution we're sending you now in this call is just that over time, there'll be an equilibration, which is there is some excess capacity in the field because COVID is suppressing procedures. And at some point, COVID will lift, and that capacity will be absorbed. Some folks will invest ahead, getting ready and being able to work on backlog and others will be conservative and wait till they consume that capacity. Forecasting that is hard. And so, that's how we're trying to help you navigate through this. But Marshall, please clean up anything that you need to do in that answer.
Marshall Mohr: No, you hit it perfectly.
Amit Hazan: Okay. And as my follow-up and separate on data and digital engagements to date. Again, kind of going off of a comment you made last week at hospital analytics and you talked about the 350 hospitals, 690 engagements. I'm just wondering how much more color you can give on that in terms of how much of that is that programmatic variety that you talked about that won't necessarily be monetized versus something that could either improve outcomes or reduce costs and potentially be monetized? Just any color around those early engagements would be helpful? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Thanks for the question. When we’re talking about what we shared with you in the talk at JPMorgan, most of that is programmatic analysis. And it's not so much something that we think is going to be revenue-generating directly. We think that it illuminates the value of our ecosystem and strong da Vinci programs. And that is a benefit to us. It increases the stick rate, allows people to see in a verifiable way within their own data sets, the value they're bringing. It gives them action plans to find opportunity for standardization and other kinds of efficiency improvements. So, it's of high value to the customer and high value to us. Some of the other things that we've shared with you, for example, Iris, those things are something that we'll collect revenue for. They probably won't become huge revenue arms in and of themselves, but they bring value on a per case basis. And it's something that we can talk to the customer about in terms of value creation there. They also strengthen the ecosystem. So, I think for shareholders who are asking the question, “Hey, when does informatics and machine learning create a revenue arm of its own?” I'm not sure that's the right question. I think that analytics and informatics power the ecosystem as a whole. We're pretty agnostic as to how we get paid for that. If we get paid for that through increased utilization, wonderful. That works great. We look at cost to develop those programs and kind of overall their contribution to our financial health. But we don't have to charge for them individually if that's not how a customer wants to pay for it. Let me turn it to you, Marshall, and any color you want to add.
Marshall Mohr: No, I think, that's right. I think that we look at it as the opportunity to increase the ecosystem and to expand our base and/or accelerate adoption.
Amit Hazan: Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Amit.
Operator: Next we have the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
David Lewis: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Marshall, I appreciate we don't have guidance and I appreciate your commentary on spending levels for 2021, but as I'm sure you appreciate, without revenue figures, those are kind of hard numbers to put in context. So, I was wondering if you could help us out a little bit more. I mean, is the right messaging here that OpEx growth in 2021 is going to go faster than whatever the sales growth rate is? Or ask that kind of same question a different way. I mean, SG&A for the last several years has grown in line with revenue and R&D has grown kind of 2x revenue growth rates. Are those the type of -- any of those parameters you would kind of give us any visibility and to be super helpful? And then, I've got a couple of follow-ups.
Marshall Mohr: It's a good question. And I am empathetic to the fact that we aren't giving you revenue guidance. And so, it's hard to put those numbers in context. However, it really does come down to that -- the impacts of COVID are really pretty unpredictable. And so, if COVID wanes quickly, then I think the spend we're talking about might match up better with the revenue increase. But I got to tell you, the point of my -- the reason I pointed this all out in terms of the increases in expenses that we were able -- this year, we saw a long period where COVID impacted us. And we -- some of the variable expenses I outlined, came in pretty low relative to what they historically had been. And those will increase as COVID goes away. But in addition to that, there are other expenses that we will continue to spend. The increase -- there will be increases regardless of what happens to COVID. I think, we want to continue to invest in the R&D areas that I mentioned. And we want to -- because we see that there's a real opportunity to continue to expand our marketplace and to expand penetration in the long-term. And so, we're going to increase those costs. I know I haven't given you what you're looking for, but it's just a very difficult environment to predict revenue and procedures at this point.
David Lewis: Okay. And then, just maybe two quick follow-ups, one easier to answer than the other. Just in terms of volumes, obviously, fourth quarter was more similar to third quarter. And generally speaking, the message from most corporates last week was that first quarter is going to be at fourth quarter, if not frankly a little worse. I just wonder if you could sort of comment on sort of what you're seeing from the procedure environment here in the first quarter? And then, just secondarily, on the Extended Use Program, obviously, we saw kind of a bolus on revenue per procedure this particular quarter as hospitals didn't change inventory patterns. Are you seeing any evidence? I know it's hard in COVID that it's driving higher demand, the Extended Use Program driving higher demand. And when would you expect those revenue per procedure numbers to begin to reverse? Is that as early as the first quarter, or probably more likely middle part of the year? Sorry for both questions. Thanks so much.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. So, your -- the first part of your question was...
Gary Guthart: Q1 volume update.
Marshall Mohr: Yes, Q1 volume. I made the comment that as we went through the quarter, the resurgence became more acute and it had a greater impact on procedures. And so I gave you the California example of where you go from growth in October to reduction in December. That should be an indication of the level of sort of impact they can have. And then, I also made the comment that we saw the trends at the end of the quarter continue into January. So, I think you said that other companies are saying that Q1 could be worse, it could be. But again, we're not going to try to predict exactly where it's going to come out, given the uncertainties around it. But it's clear coming into the quarter, it was at the bottom end of what was going on in Q4. As far as Extended Use Instruments go, we launched it in the U.S. in -- at the beginning of the quarter and in Europe in the middle of the quarter, about three quarters of our customers are now acquiring Extended Use Instruments. They're starting to be used on procedures. It's really hard for us to predict exactly when we'll start to see the benefits of those Extended Use Instruments in terms of elasticity and price elasticity, and it's certainly going to be confounded by COVID. So, I think it will take time. I think it's going to take a while before we start to see that. Sometimes you have to point out the benefits to the hospital. You have to sell it a little bit. And I just think we'll be patient about it.
Operator: Next, we have the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.
Bob Hopkins: Gary, I wanted to get you up in two geographies, if okay. First, on the U.S. Just curious, do you think that perhaps by the second half of this year, there's a chance based on everything you're seeing that we could be close to a normal level of surgical procedure volumes in the U.S., or given what you're seeing on the diagnostic side and the slow vaccine rollout that that's more likely to be a 2022 event? And then, I'd also love to get your opinion on China and the durability of the phenomenal growth you appear to be having here of late.
Gary Guthart: Hey Bob. On the first one, the U.S., I won't predict for you, but let's talk about the puts and the takes, the things that are going to be the push-pull about it. Clearly, hospitals want to get back to treating patients who are non-COVID patients. There is a demand and the desire to do that. It takes a couple of things. One is that resources get freed up from treating COVID patients to allow them to treat other things, and some of that is ICU resources and a lot of it is staff. So, as COVID surges go, so does access to that set of resources. Your tracking and analysis is as good as ours in terms of looking at how well the vaccine is going to go out and what the COVID numbers might be. So, I think, that's a large part of it. In terms of the diagnostic pipelines, kind of the same thing. I think, everybody wants to get patients back in to get diagnosed. We think backlog that's been building for surgical patients as the search happens, and then you have this longer been forgoing normal checkups, whether it's colonoscopies or PSA screening or what have you, that will start coming back in. And of course, disease doesn't take a holiday. And as a result, those things will be more advanced when they're caught. We've seen this before. We’ve been in this movie when we saw changes to PSA testing recommendations. That will again create a backlog, but it will take longer for it to realize and longer for it to process through. I don't think it's going to drive substantive share shifts between treatment modalities. I think, it's going to be hard on patients as they go through that. And that will provide a headwind for us in -- certainly in 2021 and then tailwinds thereafter as those folks are diagnosed and come back into the pipe. So, that's kind of where I see the U.S. Moving to China, long term, we're quite excited. Pretty clearly, Chinese patients are interested in high quality care. Chinese surgeons are quite interested in robotics and in da Vinci and our partnership with Fosun and the joint venture is going well for us. So, in the near term, that feels great, and I think, there's a lot of strong underlying. As we've talked about before, the medical marketplace in China is complicated. Right now, systems are under quota, centrally managed quota. We see changes occurring in the Chinese regulatory environment over time as the FDA implements new policies and processes and we see that there are Chinese companies that are interested in this opportunity are pushing hard to field competitive systems. So, we are committed long-term to China. I think, it's going to be a strong demand market and a bouncy, sometimes turbulent marketplace due to policy changes and some of the central controls that are in place. We'll keep you updated as we get more clarity there.
Operator: Next we have the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.
Larry Biegelsen: I'll just ask one multipart question on Ion. I'm just curious to know kind of the -- what comes next year? You talked about the PRECISE data completing enrollment I think in the second quarter. Should we assume that we see that data in 2022? Is there any update on Ion in China? And then, your competition has talked about indication expansion beyond lung bronchoscopy. Any color you're willing to share there? And just lastly, adding a therapeutic capability to Ion. So, basically, the roadmap here on Ion, what can we expect maybe going forward here? Thanks for taking the question.
Gary Guthart: All right. Thanks, Larry. Philip, I'm going to turn to you on PRECISE trial timing. And then, I'll take it from there.
Philip Kim: Yes. With respect to when you might hear some data, it is a fair assumption to expect to hear something in 2022. We haven't been more specific beyond that, Larry.
Gary Guthart: With regard to future indications, right now, where we're at with Ion, we are -- our commercial teams and our manufacturing operations teams are tightly focused on supplying and performing in the diagnostic bronchoscopy market, our first indication. Clearly, Ion is a platform technology, and we're excited about it. That said, I'd remind everybody, we are in early innings, all of us, the entire field is in early innings with regard to bronchoscopy. Our clinical results there are outstanding. I think that they are market-leading relative to competitors, any of the competitors. And we want to fulfill that market. We want to satisfy those customers. That means satisfying them in terms of quality and demand and shipments and so on. We think there are longer term applications beyond bronchoscopy and beyond diagnostics, and we're working on those. We are working on ablation technologies and some other things. We're not ready to speak publicly about where we might go next for a couple of reasons. One is, we're still in the very earliest innings about making bronchoscopy a reality; and two, for competitive reasons, we're not ready yet to describe what we intend to do next.
Larry Biegelsen: And China, Gary?
Gary Guthart: On the China front, we of course have the joint venture with Fosun. We are working through pathways for Ion in China. We think there is a market there. I would advise folks that the Chinese regulatory system and CFDA handles gen 1 products pretty differently than FDA does in the U.S. And as a result, you want to see a little greater maturity in your product line before you go broadly there. So, we're working through that with our JV and also with the Chinese regulators. When we have some time lines for you, we will describe them. But, we remain active and interested.
Operator: Next, we have the line of Tycho Peterson, JP Morgan.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Gary, you mentioned no kind of shift in treatment modalities. So, I assume the deceleration doesn't imply any kind of share loss to laparoscopic. But as we think about coming out of the pandemic, the other side of it is you highlight a remote technology, for monitoring, proctoring and analysis. Are there structural changes here you think coming out of the pandemic that could drive faster adoption of robotics?
Gary Guthart: I believe so. Now, this is -- the right answer is we'll see. Time will tell. But, there are some encouraging anecdotes and they’re anecdotes. One is, I think folks are realizing that a lot can get done without jumping on planes and that's true for surgeons. And one of the things that our teams have done beautifully this year is to more fully digitize and regionalize training. That has been great. So, forward deployment of training and greater use of digital tools, that will continue, and I think the acceptance of that is increasing. It's also accelerated remote proctoring, as you said. So, I think that has been a positive for us and something that we had thankfully made some investments in prior to the pandemic. The second part is I think that people are seeing changes in resource consumption, days in the hospital, ICU time, patient comforted, being housed in hospitals in the pandemic, has declined. And I think that will be durable. I think, even after COVID rates start to drop, I think folks thinking that sitting around a hospital isn't a great idea, and using ICU resources when you don't have to isn't a great idea. And I already, I think we see that folks are saying, hey, really high-quality minimally invasive surgery done well. And by the way, having the analytics to back that up is going to be appreciated and maybe an accelerant. So, I am cautiously optimistic that some of the trends we're seeing in terms of what recovery might be are going to be real positive for Intuitive.
Tycho Peterson: Another thing you highlighted at the conference was the regulatory requirements and time lines for the industry keep increasing. I know that's something you've been talking about for a while. But as we think about the roadmap here for SP, the IDE trial for colorectal, have the time lines gotten pushed out further in your view, given the regulatory burden, or is just kind of in line with what you've been talking about for a while?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I think we're starting to see the contours of the regulation side in the U.S. stabilize. So, it's stabilizing at a requirement level that's greater than it was in years past, but I don't think it's continuously moving. That's been good. I think, the thing that's challenged some time lines for us and others is COVID. If your clinical trial sites are having to manage COVID as well as whatever your clinical trial is, that can put pressure on you. That's kind of a near term thing. I think, longer term, the question of what does this do if clinical trial requirements and general data requirements in the U.S. and Europe for computer aided systems and robotics have become greater, what does that imply? And it probably implies a couple of things. One is that systems in the market are likely to stay in the market a little longer because it's just extended time lines for innovation. I think, the other thing is that it probably resequences when you see different products where in the world because some health care systems, Korea being notable, are allowing innovative products into their systems a little more quickly and other ones are becoming a little less. So, for a Company like us, you'll see increased investment in headcount and in resources for clinical and regulatory staff, and you'll see a reordering of where we go with new innovations over time. You'll probably see for the industry platforms sit a little longer that probably benefits incumbents a little more than it does in surgeons.
Tycho Peterson: Great. And then one last one on the extended use rollout. You did Europe recently, U.S. last quarter. Is there a next step to the process? Are you going to do it in Asia? And any reason the elasticity would be different in any of the geographies in your view?
Gary Guthart: Marshall, why don't you take that first?
Marshall Mohr: Sure. The rollout into other parts of the world will depend on the regulatory time lines. As you could imagine, in China, it will take a long time. In some of the other markets, it might be a little bit quicker. I don't have a complete roadmap of every country. But yes, Asia Pac is absolutely on our mind. And we'd like to get them out to our direct markets in Asia as soon as possible. As far as the impact on elasticity, we did two things in the United States, if you recall. We modified the -- we obviously launched Extended Use Instruments, which lower the cost of care for hospitals, but we also -- simultaneous with that, lowered the price of a few select instruments that are used typically in lower benign -- lower acuity procedure -- or benign lower acuity procedures like cholecystectomy, benign hysterectomies and inguinal hernias. And then, in totality, then the use that -- if you look at an instrument, set that might be used in cholecystectomies, then the cost is competitive with other minimally invasive approaches. In each country, we have modified the pricing differently, and we're targeting those procedures that are pressured by reimbursement. So, you can't kind of paint or butter spread the comment of what elasticity will do in the United States will happen in the other countries. But, we are targeting specified procedures in each of those countries where reimbursement is stressed, and we believe we provide value. And we'll see. We believe that we'll create some elasticity in each country. It will just vary in terms of magnitude.
Operator: Okay. Next, we have the line of Richard Newitter of SVB Leerink.
Richard Newitter: If I could just start off on the competitive landscape, Gary, any comments you could offer on internationally, any competitors that are on the market, and what you're seeing out there relative to kind of what you would have expected? And then, in the U.S., just in light of some updates from mainly competitor. J&J recently, this fall provided an update on the feature set? And any thoughts you would care to offer where they're going to be trying to compete, particularly on kind of extra robotic arms, et cetera?
Gary Guthart: Sure. Just on the -- just speaking to the international side, the first thing I'd remind everybody is it's not really a robot versus robot question for customers. It's really a robotically-enabled ecosystem that drives outcomes versus a robotically-enabled ecosystem that drives different outcomes. That is programmatic versus programmatic. So, each of these, when they come out, we kind of look at it and say, okay, what's the robot capable of, do they have the instruments and the accessories, the imaging systems, the advanced tools that are required, some of those software and analytic capabilities, training capabilities and so on? And you see a pretty different skill set and capability out of each of these ecosystems. And that's true as well for some of the bigger competitors that are domestic. So, that's how we think about it. And I think that's how customers, by and large, will think about it. There will always be some customers who are interested in trialing and seeing what's capable out of something new, so I'd expect that. Nothing architecturally that I've seen of any of them, including the most recent announcements, has surprised me. I think we've seen a lot of these ideas. We've trialed personally a lot of them inside the Company. And so I think time will tell. We have made the trade-offs we've made for a reason based on evaluation, building product and kind of scientific method. And I think that customers will evaluate those trade-offs over time. We've also seen the idea that some of the bigger players want to bundle, that they're going to put all these things together, maybe lower the price of capital and try to throw some other things in to see if they can entice folks. And I think the way I'd ask customers and shareholders to think about it is bundling makes sense if the underlying products are commodities, if everybody is selling two ply toilet paper and one brand is not that different than the other, it's all fine. But that's not where we are. Robotic systems and the instrumentation and the imaging systems are not commoditized. And as a result, there'll be strong differences. and how they're used and what the outcomes are. And in that regard, I think that's what we'll point our customers to and our sales force to understand as these different things come up.
Richard Newitter: Got it. And if I could just have one more follow-up on the capital environment and the discussions that you're having. As you talk to the institutions, as they think of the 2021 budgets. I'm curious, one, are they kind of thinking of a two-year budgeting process, or is it any different than the way they've approached their budgeting in the past in the wake of COVID? And then, maybe two, is the -- what signs are they saying they're going to look forward to kind of get back to you to have confidence to go and make the purchase with the uncertainty that still exists? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Marshall, why don't you kick off that answer, and I'll add a little when you're done.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. I think the first part of your question, what are they doing from a budget perspective? I don't have enough insight to be able to answer the question well. We said that we believe that they'll go through a reset of course for 2021. I don't know if they'll have the same level of spending they did. We believe that there is financial pressure on the hospitals -- on a number of the hospitals as a result of COVID. So, there's the possibility that 2021 budgets will be less -- will be smaller than they were in 2020. But, I don't have great insight to that.
Gary Guthart: Yes. I think, the thing I would point to that I think is kind of a economics question for everybody is just going to be something to look at is they will make their estimates as to how fast folks will return and whether they want to accelerate, so that they have capacity available for dealing with the backlog. I think that that will differ by hospital groups. So, some folks will have the capital capacity to lean in and see this as an opportunity to deepen their exposure or their presence in market. Others will feel conservative and will want to wait and see. So, I do not think it's going to be one size fits all in terms of how they do their financial planning. That was our last question. So, I'll conclude from here. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking to you again in three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the presentation for this afternoon. Again, we thank you very much for all of your participation and for using our teleconferencing services.

Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter was a productive one with return to growth and da Vinci procedure amid continuing adaptation to customer needs. In the field performance grew strongly by region, given differences in pandemic impact. Operational performance inside the company has been strong, with remarkable focus and diligence by our teams. Turning first to global procedures, Q3 2020 procedures grew 7% compared with Q3 2019. Procedure growth varied widely by country, with growth returning to most of the countries we serve with a direct commercial team. U.S. growth was in the mid-single digits and procedure growth in China’s stood out is particularly strong. Analyzing current global quarterly procedure performance compared with Q3 2019 by clinical category, general surgery is rebounding most quickly, posting double-digit growth with mid single-digit growth in gynecology and modest growth in urology. Overall, we have seen utilization increasing for our customers as their resources become available, indicating that surgeons and hospitals are maintaining their commitment to minimally invasive surgery. da Vinci enables access to high quality minimally invasive care, increasing the number of patients who can return home sooner and decreasing the demand on ICU resources, clearly important in the era of COVID-19. Currently, two factors are at play at hospitals, as hospitals treat both COVID and non-COVID patients. First, there are some deferred cases that were scheduled in the spring and summer that have now come back to the hospital for treatment. Second, diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopies and PSA tests have been delayed and may not be back to pre-COVID levels now. The delay in diagnostic visits will delay disease detection and like prostate screening changes in 2012 create a reservoir of patients with more advanced disease. This push pull of those patients who delayed a scheduled surgery coming back into hospitals now and the delay of disease identification due to diagnostic visit postponement makes hospital patient volumes hard to model for coming quarters. That said, full diagnostic recovery is in everyone’s interest and we expect surgery to return to pre-pandemic levels over the mid-term. Philip will take you through procedure trends later in the call. Given the slowdown in procedures due to the pandemic we expected weaker capital demand in the third quarter. For the quarter, we installed 195 new systems. This compares to 275 installs in Q3 2019 and 178 installs in Q2 2020. Year-over-year install base growth was 8% at the end of Q3 after accounting for trade-ins. We know the correlation between system utilization in the form of procedure demand and the need for new capital capacity at hospitals is strong. Many hospitals will seek to absorb existing capacity before installing new capital. In regions in which da Vinci systems are more common, hospitals may delay adding new systems until utilization recovers. Average globally we continue to expect a challenging near- to mid-term environment for future capital placements, as COVID-19 wears on and hospital finances remain strained. Because COVID is impacting locales differently, we see significant variability in procedure growth and new system placement pipelines by region. Marshall will take you through capital placement trends and risks later in the call. At Intuitive we are focused on those activities and priorities within our control. Our team in the field, in our labs, in our factories and working in homes and offices is performing well. We adapted our priorities for 2020 to meet the challenge of the pandemic and the needs of those we serve. First, we are focused on the health and well being of patients, customers, our employees and our communities. Second, we are focused on inventory and supply chain management. So far product availability has been very strong. Thanks to the relentless work of our supply chain teams and our partners. Third, we implemented our Customer Financial Relief Program and/or Extended Use Instruments Program. The timeliness and the design of these programs has been well received by our customers. Fourth, we continue to invest in our high priority development programs. Recognizing that high quality MIS is more important in the coming years not less so. If we are accelerating activities that help us adapt to the current environment and for which demand is likely to be durable post-COVID. Finally, we have constraints spend where we believe it is inefficient in the current environment. With these priorities as our guide, our operational and financial performance served both our customers and our company well in the quarter. Intuitive commercial and learning teams adjusted their work methods to meet customers where they are, figuratively and literally. Over the years our time -- our teams have built a strong network of capable field trainers, sales reps, surgeon proctors and cloud enabled da Vinci systems. Our professional education and commercial teams engage this network, implementing on-site digital and regional programs such that customer engagement and training programs are approaching pre-pandemic levels, a remarkable achievement. Across the company, our teams have prioritized their efforts and practice physical discipline. Based on quality and automation improvements and continued attention, our manufacturing teams are managing our product costs well, leading to strong gross margin performance, while we implemented our Customer Relief Program and our Extended Use Program for Generation 4 instruments. While the pandemic has created near- and mid-term uncertainty in the form of competing healthcare priorities and economic stresses, I have high confidence in the need for high quality, minimally invasive surgery and therapies in long-term. To deal with the current and future stresses on the healthcare system, payers, hospitals and surgeons are looking for solutions that improve outcomes, decrease in hospital resource consumption and lower total cost to treat. In other words, the core pillars of the quadruple aim we had set as our goal many years ago. We have a team that has demonstrated physical discipline, particularly in light of the pandemic. Over time, we plan to increase investment in our innovation engines to improve the quadruple aim at our customers and to expand our market opportunity. And we will continue to invest in our virtuous cycle of quality and efficiency gains in production, that fuel quality improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and pricing flexibility for our customers that can lead to increase volume. Looking at product operations in the quarter, our advanced instruments and endoscopy programs are producing strong clinical and financial results. Customer adoption of our stapler product line, our vessel sealers and our E-100 generator has been encouraging. Utilization of these products and their targeted clinical procedures and their reorder rates has been strong. Despite disruptions caused by COVID in 2020, uptake of newly launched products, as well as our newest endoscope, Endoscope Plus has also been strong. As we have said in the past, a great clinical procedure takes the customer, the right system, the right instruments, the right imaging, the right training and the right support. As our Generation 4 ecosystem has matured, customers achieve high utilization rates for our target procedures in Gen 4 accounts. Our Ion program continues to advance with 11 systems placed in the quarter, many of which are in large teaching institutions. Ion diagnostic procedures are also returning to significant growth. Early clinical studies comparing Ion to existing alternatives in the market, both handheld and robotic, are beginning to be published and are encouraging, supporting the architectural decisions made early by our design team. While our progress in our precise trial for Ion has been slowed, we are seeing a return to cases as our clinical trial partners come free. Lastly, our team continues to incorporate learnings from customers and improving our system, our manufacturing and our supply chain, as we have worked diligently to support Ion at greater scale. Turning to our SP system, its clinical evidence continues to mount and advocacy for the system by surgeons who use it is increasing, procedures on SP rebounded nicely in the third quarter. I am quite encouraged by the commentary from surgeons on the performance of the system and the potential for it to impact a wider variety of procedures over time. In the United States, we are pursuing expanded clinical indications in a number of areas with our colorectal IDE trials reading initiation. Our system in first clinical case sites are standing by to start the study pending feedback from FDA and barring additional headwinds from COVID-19. If these go to plan we expect first cases in Q4 of this year or Q1 of 2021. Our cloud simulation, intelligence and analytics programs are also performing well. We have accelerated our cloud and remote technology efforts this year, with use of our remote case observations and our network simulators ramping quickly. In the quarter, our network surgical simulators were used over 87,000 times, roughly doubling year-over-year. Our IRIS augmented reality program entered limited launch in Q4 of last year and has recovered well in Q3. Lastly, our customer analytics efforts have been well utilized by hospitals in 2020 and are scaling nicely. As we finalize our 2021 planning it’s worth reflecting for a moment. The opportunity for improvement in acute interventions including surgery is a substantial and decade’s long journey. The fourth quarter of 2020 will mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of Intuitive and the 21st year of clinical use. Looking back at what has been achieved and forward to the important work that remains to be done, we are committed both to our organic innovation and to expanding the universe of bright minds who can improve medicine with the types of science and technology got pioneered. To that end, we launched our Intuitive Ventures Group, a part of our futures initiatives, whose mission is to accelerate opportunities at the frontiers of medicine. Intuitive Ventures Group’s first fund is $100 million dollars and our team is engaging globally with entrepreneurs, having funded some in the quarter. We look forward to seeing what solutions they bring to complex problems. In closing, our priorities for the next few quarters remain as follows. First, continued strong performance on customer, employee and community safety, while ensuring supply chain stability. Second, continued support of our customers adapted to their specific conditions. Well support them according to their needs. Third, advancing our priority programs, instruments, accessories, endoscopy systems and intelligence programs. And finally, disciplines spend management during this period of change. I will now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I would describe the highlights of our performance on the non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Key business metrics for the third quarter were as follows. Third quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 7% compared with the third quarter of 2019. It increased approximately 36% compared with last quarter. Third quarter placements of 195 systems decreased 29%, compared with 275 systems last year, it increased 10%, compared with 178 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 8% to approximately 5,865 systems. This growth rate compares with 9% in the last quarter and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system declined approximately 2% compared with last year and increased 33% compared with last quarter. Let me walk you through the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on procedures and system placements and how it impacts our business. Overall, procedures recovered gradually during the quarter to around 90% of pre-COVID levels by the end of the quarter. However, the extent and pace of recover varied by market. In the U.S., reflect -- we reflected several underlying themes. We experienced broader adoption across multiple procedures led by general surgery. For example, we saw significant year-over-year bariatric procedure growth. Partially offsetting broader adoption is the impact of reduced diagnosis and treatment of conditions given patients concern over COVID exposure and regional COVID resurgences and regional that disrupt elective procedures. The reduction of diagnosis and treatment was the most -- was most pronounced in prostate cancer. Dynamics that affected the U.S. also affected our OUS markets. In summary, we saw higher procedure growth in markets where COVID spread is lower, like China and Japan, compared with markets where COVID impact is greater, like the U.K. and India. While total worldwide procedure rates have improved, it is possible that resurgences of COVID-19 like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and the U.S. could negatively impact da Vinci procedures. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions could also negatively impact da Vinci procedures. Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Although capital placements were higher in the second quarter, third quarter placements reflected headwinds, we discussed last quarter, including hospitals filling existing system capacity before purchasing additional capital and delayed capital spending while hospitals revisit their capital budgets given the impacts of COVID-19. Utilization in the third quarter was 2% lower than the third quarter of 2019, while the second quarter 2020 utilization was 27% lower than the second quarter of 2019. Going forward, we expect these same headwinds to impact capital placements. In addition, macro economic conditions created by COVID could also impact hospital spending. And as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total third quarter revenue was $1,078 million, representing a 4.5% decrease from last year and a 26% increase from last quarter. Third quarter 2020 revenue reflects $23 million of service credits issued in relation to the previously announced Customer Relief Program where we provide service credits to customers as their use of da Vinci systems were lower than pre-COVID comp volumes. Total service credits issued under the Customer Relief Program which has now ended were $82 million. Leasing represented 35% of current quarter placements, compared with 29% last quarter. Second quarter placements included a higher proportion of China placements, where leasing is prohibited. Excluding China we saw increased demand for leasing structures. In an environment of COVID-19 and as economic pressures increase, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. 40% of systems placed in the third quarter involve trade-ins consistent with last quarter. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. We recognize $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter, compared with $9 million last quarter and $20 million last year. Lease buyout revenue is varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure increased slightly to approximately $1,910 per procedure, compared with $1,900 per procedure in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased compared with $1,980 realized in the third quarter of last year. The decrease compared to last year reflects customer buying patterns partially offset by increased advanced instrument usage. In the third quarter of 2020, we did not experience reduced purchases of instruments that we anticipated in advance of the launch of Extended Use Instruments. In early October, we launched our Extended Use Instruments in the U.S. Extended Use Instruments have 12 to 18 uses, compared with our previous 10 use instruments. In addition, we are reducing the price of certain instruments used commonly in lower acuity procedures and our lower reimburse procedures. We plan to launch our Extended Use Instruments later in the fourth quarter in Europe and in 2021 and 2022 in other markets depending on regulatory requirements. Overall, Extended Use Instruments and lower instrument pricing will result in lower INA revenue per procedure to Intuitive. For example, had the Extended Use Instruments been available and the lower instrument pricing been in place for all of 2019, revenue for 2019 would have been $150 million to $170 million less than reported and INA per procedure would have been 7% lower. The impact of these actions on future revenue will depend on procedure volumes, instrument usage and mix, and whether cost elasticity will enable greater penetration into available markets. Beginning in the fourth quarter with the introduction of Extended Use Instruments, we expect that INA revenue and revenue per procedure will be lower than it otherwise would have been. Six of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems reflecting both our measured rollout of SP and the continued impact of COVID-19. Our installed base of SP systems is now 58, eight in Korea and 50 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP surgical system will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. As Gary outlined, we expect to initiate first cases associated with colorectal clinical trial by the first quarter of 2021. We placed 11th Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 32 systems. Ion system placements also continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Ion system placements, procedures and related information is excluded from our overall systems and procedure counts. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured, while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain. Procedures under the precise study are being completed at a slower pace than anticipated due to COVID-19. Based on the current pace of procedures we expect the precise study to complete in the second quarter of 2021. Outside the U.S., we placed 79 systems in the third quarter, compared with 90 in the third quarter of 2019 and 72 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 39 into Europe, 15 into Japan and 12 into China, compared with 36 into Europe, 27 into Japan and 10 into China in the third quarter of 2019. During the third quarter, MOH in China expanded the previous 154 system quota for the period 2016 through 2020 to 225 systems. The timeline for purchasing the 125 systems remaining under the expanded quota is the same as the original quota, which is the hospital’s allocated quota by December 31, 2020, have two years to complete their tenders. We expect more of their remaining systems to be completed towards the end of the two-year period and only approximately a dozen systems to be placed in the fourth quarter of 2020. We also anticipate other companies to achieve regulatory approval over the next year or so. If approved, those competitors will share in the remaining quota. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses, pro forma margin -- gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 70.2%, compared with 72% for the third quarter of 2019 and 62.4% last quarter. The second quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with abnormally low production, higher impact of the Customer Relief Program and higher excess in obsolete inventory charges. The decrease relative to the third quarter of 2019 reflects higher period costs associated with abnormally low production, the Customer Relief Program, partially offset by product mix. As revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor costs and under absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. In addition, product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and could cause fluctuation in gross margins. Pro forma operating expenses increased 1% compared with the third quarter of 2019 and increased around 5% compared with last quarter. The increase in third quarter operating expenses compared with the third quarter of 2019 is driven by higher investments in product development activities including informatics, advanced imaging in our Ion and SP platforms, and investment in headcounts and capabilities in OUS markets. This was partially offset by reduced spending on activities directly impacted by COVID-19, including marketing events, travel and training and reduce spending, reflecting continued discipline throughout the organization. Relative to last quarter, spending reflects increase -- increases in training and travel, increased spending on product development areas outlined and partially offset by reduced spending. We continue to believe that we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer aided surgery and acute interventions around the world and we will continue to invest in the business for the long-term. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.8%, compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our third quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $334 million or $2.77 per share, compared with $409 million or $3.43 per share for the third quarter of 2019 and $132 million or $1.11 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $314 million or $2.60 per share for the third quarter of 2020, compared with GAAP net income of $396 million or $3.33 per share for the third quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $68 million or $0.57 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. It includes excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition related items, and legal settlements. Third quarter of 2020 GAAP net income also included pretax gains of $62 million on our investments in private entities resulting from purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains net of tax is $0.39 per share. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.4 million, compared with $6.1, sorry, $6.4 billion, compared with $6.1 billion at June 30, 2020. Cash generated from operations and stock exercises was partially offset by investments in working capital and our infrastructure. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our current thoughts on capital deployment are in the following order. We recognize the hardship that COVID-19 places on our customers and we will work with customers to ease the burden of lower da Vinci utilization, including providing customers with more flexible financing. We will ensure a secure supply chain and build appropriate levels of inventory to ensure customer supply. We will invest in securing our employees. We will continue to reinvest in the business focused on expanding our market opportunity or accelerating adoption of our products. We will continue to open market repurchase program consistent with our prior practice. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over procedure performance.
Philip Kim: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was 7%, compared to 20% growth during the third quarter of 2019 and the 19% decline last quarter. Our Q3 procedure growth was driven by 7% growth in the U.S. and 9% growth OUS. U.S. general surgery and China were key drivers of procedure growth in Q3. In the U.S. Q3 procedure growth was largely driven by strength in general surgery, hernia, coli and bariatric were the largest drivers of growth within general surgery in the quarter. Bariatric procedures have been an increased area of focus in 2020 and may also have benefited from certain patients prioritizing weight loss as obesity is a significant COVID risk factor. In China, procedure growth accelerated meaningfully as new systems installed under the quota began to provide additional capacity for incremental growth. Q3 China procedure growth was strong with broad based growth in urology, thoracic, general surgery and gynecology. With respect to our more mature procedure categories in the U.S., Q3 gynecology procedure growth was up low-single digits year-over-year with hysterectomy for cancer volumes growing mid-single digits. Q3 dVH-benign procedures were up modestly year-over-year. In the U.S., dVP procedures in the third quarter declined high-single digits in the quarter compared to a year ago. We believe a constricted diagnostic pipeline may be impacting dVP volumes as patients may be postponing cancer screening procedures during the pandemic. On a worldwide basis, dVP procedures in the third quarter declined mid-single digits compared to a year ago. We do not have visibility as to when the diagnostic pipeline returns. Certain states that saw increased COVID cases had lower growth rates. At the end of Q2 procedure volumes in these states slowed and gradually recovered later in the third quarter. We would caution investors that our visibility of COVID outbreaks is limited and that procedure volumes may fluctuate when certain geographies face an uptick in COVID. Third quarter OUS procedure volume grew 9%, compared to 23% growth for the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter OUS growth was driven by continued growth in urology, thoracic, general surgery and gynecology. In Japan, procedure growth moderated versus Q2 due to a slowdown in dVP. Overall, European procedures grew modestly in Q3 as countries recovered from COVID. In Q3, Germany, France and Italy contributed to year-over-year growth, while the U.K. declined. However, we would caution that as COVID surges occur in different countries, procedures can be impacted adversely. It is important to note that we do not have guidance and Q3 trends may not be indicative of future results due to potential COVID surges, patients willingness to have procedures done and a restricted diagnostic pipeline. Now turning to the clinical side of our business, each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deemed to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Early this year an article led by Dr. Melissa LaPinska from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in the Journal of Surgical Endoscopy provided results from one of the largest matched case series analysis for non-complex ventral hernia repair based on real world evidence utilizing the abdominal core Health Quality Collaborative. The study compared 1,230 subjects undergoing either robotic assisted or laparoscopic non-complex ventral hernia repair. In a propensity score matched analysis with 615 subjects in each cohort, the robotic assisted approach had a shorter mean length of stay by two days, a lower rate of conversion by over 1%, a lower rate of clinic re-encounters through 30 days by 6% and a lower rate of surgical site occurrences or infections requiring treatments by 2.4%. In article with Dr. Ravi Rajaram, David Rice and Eduardo Bruera from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery provided results from a real world evidence analysis using the premier hospital database from lobectomy. This study included patients who underwent an elective lobectomy for primary lung cancer between January 1, 2013 and September 30, 2015, with the objective to compare post-operative inpatient opioid administration after robotic-assisted lobectomy compared to open and video assisted thoracoscopic surgery approaches. In a propensity score matched analysis with over 2,000 subjects in each cohort, robotic-assisted lobectomy patients use a lower total opioid dose and lower average daily dose assess through the median morphine equivalent daily dosage, compared to patients undergoing either an open or VATS approach from post-operative day one until discharge. In both comparisons over the same period, open lobectomy and VATS patients were more likely to be administered opioids compared to those undergoing a robotic-assisted procedure, 7.6% fewer robotic-assisted patients when compared to open and 2.6% fewer robotic-assisted patients when compared to VATS. The authors concluded in this study of patients with lung cancer undergoing lobectomy use of a robotic-assisted approach with associated with less opioid administration and the inpatient post-operative period compared to either VATS or lobectomy.  That includes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your question.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Hey. Good afternoon. I will start with the procedures here. You were growing 8% exiting June, and obviously, there’s a lot of give and takes on the second wave and some of the diagnostic headwinds as you flagged. But can you maybe just talk on linearity during the quarter, how is July, August and September and any color on the first half of October? And when do you think the diagnostic headwinds could reverse? How do you think that potentially could play out?
Gary Guthart: Marshall, why don’t you jump in and speak a little bit to the linearity question and I will talk a little bit -- I will pick up the diagnostic pipelines then.
Marshall Mohr: Sure. Consistent with our last call, at the beginning of the quarter was depressed relative to, let’s say, middle of June. It slowly gradually came back during the quarter. There’s choppiness, of course, because it varied region by region. But slowly came back into quarter, and probably, reached its peak near the end of the third quarter.
Gary Guthart: On the diagnostic side, I think, there’s a broad recognition by healthcare providers that it’s not in anybody’s interest for these pipelines to remain stalled. I think there are efforts to drive them. That said, in terms of how fast they refill and patient comfort to come in and get these things done. I think all of us are going to have to wait and see. So we will keep watching and tracking it. Channel check show that people are working on it. How fast did it converges? I don’t think anybody has a great predictor.
Tycho Peterson: And then, Gary, on the -- some of the developments from last quarter, the Extended Use Instruments and the price of adjustment, any anecdotal color you can provide on your customer conversations on how they are thinking about incremental usage? And then you kind of mentioned the regulatory hurdle for the Extended Use Instruments. I assume that’s pretty straightforward, but can you just comment on that as well?
Gary Guthart: Sure. On the customer feedback side, we have seen a positive response. There are different market segments, both in terms of the types of procedures that people are interested in using. Our device 4, da Vinci 4 and also different regions and those reimbursement dynamics and payment dynamics differ. In places where that has been greater stress, we have seen really positive engagement and response. We will see as it plays out in time. I think COVID in the early days of Extended Use will be a confounding factor, that the early drivers may be as simple as how folks are treating non-COVID and COVID patients concurrently. But we think as it lays out in time this is going to be really healthy for us and was not a hard analysis to do to understand the potential value of it. In terms of regulatory pathways, we don’t see real hurdles on the regulatory side. I think there’s work to be done in terms of validations, and otherwise, I think, that’s all well enhanced. So I don’t see stresses around regulatory clearances as it relates to Extended Use Instruments.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then just last one on China, you mentioned in your comments, with regard to the quarter that you may see approval for competitive systems next year. Can you just talk on the competitive environment there? Are you seeing more platforms emerge?
Gary Guthart: For several folks there, there are a handful of commercial groups in China that are working on systems of one variety or another whether they seek to compete with a multi-port da Vinci type system or a single port system or an Ion type system, we see interest in all those things. Ultimately, they will make it through the regulatory process and get into the market. We see great demand in China and the increase in the quota, I think, is a reflection of customer interest working its way through the national processes to get additional approval. So we feel like we are in a strong position competitively. We think that there’s a real market there that’s really gated and limited by the quota system and we expect others will enter the market seeing the value it has and we have oriented our teams to make sure we are meeting customer needs better than others.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Tycho.
Operator: Next we have a question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Just a few here for me, Gary. So it’s pretty clear procedure trends normalized across the quarter and you have seen that and J&J saw it as well. You talked about these various forces, exhausting backlog, hospital capacity, improving diagnosis. Is it reasonable to expect slow and steady improvement going forward, but at a more modest rate, that’s sort of the message we got from J&J, I am just wondering if you would comment on that. So we get improvement but that improvement is going to be more measured going forward?
Gary Guthart: I hesitate to characterize it just because I don’t know what the future holds for COVID outbreaks and strain. What I can say is that, hospitals are handling the concurrent needs that they have a little bit better. I think they have protocols that they feel good about. I think they have access to resources and things like PPE that early on they didn’t. That gives us some comfort that barring a massive influx that they can manage both size of patient need. What that plays out like in the future, sorry, capacity is better. It’s also clear that they want to do minimally invasive surgery and high quality minimally invasive surgery and they have an interest in using our products gives me comfort. What the weather does, what the COVID pandemic does, I think, it is harder for Intuitive to have direct insight into.
David Lewis: Okay. But it sounds like on an apples-to-apples basis all things being normal, the system continues to improve, obviously, you are not in control of exogenous factors?
Gary Guthart: I think that’s fair.
David Lewis: Okay. Very fair. Just on Extended Use, two questions for me. Marshall for you, I thought I heard, I apologize if I misheard. The customers did not change buying patterns in the third quarter. I am just sort of curious why do you think that was and are you more confident, obviously, that will change in the fourth quarter? And then, Gary, if I said to you, Extended Use is going to do one or two things, it’s going to bring more general surgeons and more types of procedures into the mix or it’s going to stimulate a significant amount of sort of Gen 4 platform demand. What do you think is sort of the bigger trigger, a bigger factor here near-term?
Marshall Mohr: So we announced in July the program for the very intent that maybe hospitals might want to take advantage of managing their inventory levels. They do what they do. I can’t answer the question as to why their buying patterns where they were. I think that -- as far as going forward, there will be a hard cutover. You are not going to see hospitals buy a combination of the two and we are not offering a combination of the two. We are basically cutting it over to the extended use instruments. So that will, like, I said in my script, that will have an impact on Q4. But I think it will be positive from a hospital economics perspective, which is the whole intent of the program, right?
Gary Guthart: Turning to the issue of what do we think it’s going to catalyze. First, we think that surgeons have an interest in using our products broadly, and in fact, in procedures that have been traditionally done laparoscopically. Early days of the company it was predominantly a substitution of open surgery. It was a way to allow minimally invasive surgery where open surgery was the norm and MIS by manual means was really difficult. And yet in general surgery we are seeing a draw, a pull by our customer base to do with da Vinci procedures that are often done with laparoscopy and there’s a reason for that. System is ergonomically sound. It allows more complex cases to be done comfortably and repeatedly, and so we see real demand there. And as a result, we feel like as we have gotten scale, as our instrument quality and processes have improved over the years and we have made design changes, we can make it easier for those who want to use it more broadly to do so economically. So we think it’s going to stimulate over the long-term more demand on that side and a better way to say it perhaps is it’s going to reduce barriers. I think customers want to go there and this reduces barriers to them getting there. With regard to upgrades, I think, there are a whole hosts of good reasons to move -- for a customer to move into a Generation 4 system, Xi or X, if they are in a Gen 3 or Gen 2 system and S or Si and Extended Use Instruments are just one of the advantages there. So I think it helps that problem, but I think that, if I had to weigh it to the former is a strong pull in this. Extended Use Instruments, next-gen imaging, next-gen advanced instruments, next-gen stapling, vessel sealing, those things are great reasons to upgrade from an Si into Gen 4.
David Lewis: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Similar question on the recovery but on the system side, Gary, how do you see that playing out over the next few quarters? Any anecdotes you can share about conversations with hospitals, utilization was down less this quarter, I think, it was last quarter and I had one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: I have been relatively pleased with the nature of conversations with hospitals around systems and how they view the robotic programs. I think they are being highly rational. I think they view high quality minimally invasive surgery is important going forward. They have a lot more data at their fingertips, a lot of its supplied by us to understand and measure the performance of their programs and they can look out and say, okay, as they -- if they get more comfortable with recovery, does this help them, and largely speaking, yes, they view it as a help. So I think that’s good. Having said that, I think, they are trying to plan what their finance is going to look like in 2021. Some of them have reasonable visibility others have low visibility. And so I think they may pace and we are seeing that pacing. I am not discouraged over the long-term. I look out, I think, that a combination of analytical prowess and recognizing the value of lower variability, high quality interventions is quite strong. So it will be hard to predict in the near-term. We expect pressure, as Marshall said. I think Marshall is right on it. Having said that, in the long-term, as procedures come back, capital will be important and we keep innovating on our products that catalyzes upgrade cycles.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks. And Gary, Intuitive has historically been almost exclusively an organic grower, investing in early in IP and developing products around that rather than buying companies with commercial products or folding in distribution. Do you expect that to change over the next few years and is that partly why you announced Intuitive Ventures? Thanks for taking the questions.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I think we have an interest in and pride in our organic innovation capabilities and I expect that to remain a pillar in part of our DNA. As we have grown and as I think the market has started to really appreciate here, I mean, the medical market, really appreciate what robotic-assisted surgery and computer aided surgery can do. I think that a lot of new avenues open and that provides opportunity for us. We have been -- we are not a not invented here culture. We are open-minded to the very bright people outside. We do a lot of activities and tuck-ins over time. Those may get bigger in time. We may continue to do it. In general, I’d prefer to bring things in earlier rather than later. On the other hand, if something is interesting, we are open-minded to it. The venture fund and our futures initiatives, I think, are really recognizing as an interesting ecosystem out there developing. There’s a lot of technology lines that can make a big difference in medicine and we would like to facilitate that growth.
Larry Biegelsen: Thank you.
Operator: Next we have a question from Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Oh! Thanks. Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to kind of try the angle of talking about new technology and pipeline. Maybe try again kind of from an R&D perspective, I think, that’s where you have been most comfortable answering it in the past. So ask it in that context, obviously, R&D spending is kind of growing right through these last couple of quarters despite the pressures. Can you just talk to the biggest buckets of R&D spend and your focus or most focused on these days and how you allocate those buckets within R&D spend?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I will start and I will ask Marshall to do a little bit more of the comparator. For us we kind of think about it in three categories. One of them is, what are the kinds of things we can invest and that makes a substantive change in outcomes, not a 2% change but a bigger one and those things get our attention and drive a set of investments, that’s one. We look out at new ways to get into the body with less damage to healthy tissue and less variability. As you know, we look a lot in ways we can bring more information to the surgeon and to make that information more understandable, whether it’s advanced imaging or higher quality imaging or machine learning. All those things are ways to help the decision-making and share the load with surgeons and we are making substantial progress in that domain. And we have been talking for several quarters now, perhaps, several years, about catalyzing a virtuous cycle of driving volume, driving quality, decreasing the cost to make our products and sharing those savings with our customers, which allows them to take our products into places they would like to go and we see that happen as well. So those are categorically where we are thinking. Marshall, I will let you take the kind of rough mix question.
Marshall Mohr: Sure. From a year-over-year perspective, as I said in my script, the biggest area of investment really is digital capabilities, AI, machine learning and informatics. Then after that would be advanced imaging and our capabilities there and you have seen us introduce new scope technologies, but also making investments in other ways to image the anatomy. And then the other two areas I’d call out would be Ion and SP, of course, as we bring those products to market.
Amit Hazan: So maybe just a related follow-up on IRIS, just given you mentioned I think that it recovered well in the quarter. I would love just a better understanding of where you are deploying it and implementation, I mean, there’s obviously some very big players in the space that you have to contend with, practically speaking and work with and partner with it. How you are seeing that develop now and what we should be thinking about over the next year or two for that evolution?
Gary Guthart: I would just kind of anchor everybody on what IRIS is. This is augmented reality program that takes preoperative 3D models, MR and CT scans, things like that that are typically already done in the workflow of a workup for a patient and making it really easy for the surgeon to have access to that data real time, first, before the case to help them visualize the case and plan, and second to have it in real-time in the console. So it’s kind of a really simple idea, and as you say, and rightly say, doing it well, executing it well is the hard part. We have some really good natural collaboration partners in the space to do that with. You think about -- we don’t go out and acquire those images ourselves. They are acquired on other people’s devices. Those companies are incented and open-minded about how to help those things progress and we have had good relationships with them. We have done some really cool proprietary things. We have a brilliant team of scientists and computer scientists who have thought hard about how to make that augmented reality work really well. And it’s easy to do a quick prototype and it’s hard to do it in such a way that it’s additive to the procedure and doesn’t get in the way of the surgeon. That’s a lot of what has been going on in IRIS since then. And then if you think about, well, where can that take you inside the body, it’s really neat. You think about you are interested in what the vasculature is up to, you are interested in what solid organs are doing, you are interested in where tumor boundaries are and surgeons getting access to that, thinking through what approach might be, getting advice from the computing system is how that might work and consulting with patients about it. Those things are really good, facilitated discussions. I think we are quite strong relative to what I see out in the market from others and where people are kind of in universities. So our team is really good. How that grows over time? What parts of the body we approach next? We have a roadmap. We are working through it. We think that surgeons and hospitals will value it. We are developing the evidence in IRIS 1.0, this first launch to really build the value and to lay that roadmap. So far, we have really passionate advocates both inside and outside the company. So, so far, so good.
Amit Hazan: Thanks very much.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Amit.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Larry Keusch: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Just -- you mentioned some of this in the prepared comments, but just sort of curious sort of how you are thinking about as you look across your procedures, where do we stand with backlog and those that have actually been completed? And at this point, we -- how are we starting to work through that backlog and really into new cases or just I am trying to get some sense of how you think that backlog is working its way through?
Gary Guthart: I think we are coming at it from three different ways and we have no great insight to share with you. I wish I had better insight. I don’t know that if somebody gave you great insight that I would believe it. Having said that, with that as a lovely setup, Phil, if anything you would like to add, please jump in.
Philip Kim: No. I mean it’s clear in our prepared comments. We talked about how there are patients that are being deferred -- that are deferring treatment right now and that’s clearly a detriment to the patient. And so we do see -- we have worked through some of the backlog, as Gary alluded to in the script, but there still are patients that are clearly deferring treatment and still are to be worked on.
Larry Keusch: Okay.
Gary Guthart: We are in close contact with our customers to the extent that we can help them provide assurance to patients to make sure that they stay attending to their healthcare. If we can partner with others to make that easier we do. We had some of those opportunities. Largely, I think, this is a -- the main owners of this process are the health providers themselves and we stand in support of them. What makes it so hard to model is that no region, no hospital, no country fits a single pattern and so you are integrating across a wide spot.
Larry Keusch: Okay. Great. And then just the second question is, again, you talked a lot about sort of the benefits of the Extended Use of the instruments and the lower pricing of the less complex instruments, and certainly, all that makes sense. I think one part of the equation that people are looking to get some color on is, so how do you look at that price elasticity and what does that do potentially to the TAM, presumably in part the analysis was done to kind of figure out what the right price for the instruments are. So just wondering if there’s anything incremental to add on how you are now thinking about the TAM expansion with sort of the changes that you made to the pricing?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Perfectly fair question. I -- clearly, we think that there’s greater demand at different price points, given both the types of procedures that people want to do and given the regions. What that TAM looks like over what period of time. I don’t think we are ready to update with you on this call. We do think over time and as we move into next year, we will have greater visibility in terms of what’s actually happening versus what our models are and we will start to share with you a little bit more of what our models look like.
Larry Keusch: Okay. Terrific. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: So, Operator, just one more caller, please.
Operator: Thank you. That question will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: Great, and good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. I will just ask one given the lateness of the hour. Gary, I thought I heard you comment that you expect procedures to return to normal sometime in the mid-term. And first, did I hear you correctly and I am just curious how you kind of define mid-term? And then lastly and maybe most importantly, I am just curious, what gives you that confidence because there are some people that are beginning to think that maybe some of these COVID issues could have sort of a lasting impact on procedures in terms of patients or logistics within hospitals, so just curious if you could add a little color to your mid-term comment?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Fair. I haven’t anchored it on a particular time horizon. I think, frankly, it’s exactly as you have really outlined in your question, what’s implied in your question is, I think, as COVID is either tamped down or concurrently managed well, every -- it’s in the healthcare system and patient’s interest to make sure that people aren’t sitting with undiagnosed conditions or suffering with diagnosed conditions that are being untreated. I think health systems globally, health policymakers and leaders of these institutions are trying to make sure they serve their constituencies well. And to me, the definition of mid-term is when they come over the hump of being able to manage that set of backlogs and the flow of patients, that may mean managing it within a COVID context or maybe that COVID impressions start to drop and they have more room. So you can imagine it plays out in a couple of different ways. So as long as hospital systems are fully in reactive mode with regard to COVID, I think, we are in the near-term. So I’d define mid-term as when folks are not in pure reaction that -- when they can manage things concurrently. And we see that executing well in some countries where COVID exists. It’s not growing out of sight and they can manage that pretty well. And where that happens, we see a return to managing surgical patients pretty well. So it’s one that starts to happen in more and more countries. How long does that take? I don’t really know and what exactly the catalysts are? Well, it depends on COVID management policy.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Very helpful. I will leave it at that. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Okay. Thanks, Bob. Well, that was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams and pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months. This concludes today’s call.
Operator: As stated, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-21 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Intuitive Q2, 2020 Earnings Release. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive’s second quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Philip Kim, whom I'm pleased to introduce our Head of Investor Relations. As for me, while passing the lead over to Phil, I plan to continue on in a support role with our Investor Relations team. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 7, 2020, and Form 10-Q, filed on April 17, 2020. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC’s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.  Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today’s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. In addition, this quarter, we have also posted charts illustrating 2020 weekly da Vinci procedure trends, which is intended to provide additional perspective and detail regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our financial results, then Philip will discuss procedure details. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. On this call, we'll describe our experience in the quarter, the actions we are taking and our priorities going forward. Our focus now and in the past is the safety and well-being of patients, care teams, our communities and our employees. Turning first to global procedures. We ended Q2, 2020 down 19% compared with Q2, 2019. The underlying driver for this decline has been the growth of COVID-19 and the communities that our customers serve. While we saw procedure declines in all categories, urology and thoracic procedures were relatively resilient, while gynecology experienced the greatest decline. Rates of recovery from lows by procedure types were more uniform. We've seen hospitals with adequate supplies of staff, PPE and physical resources returned to above 90% of pre-COVID procedure run rates over a few months period. Recovery above this number as dependent upon the intensity of COVID in the region, patient's comfort to return to the hospital, availability of testing and patient outreach. As we stand here in July, we see the continued growth of COVID in some regions, both domestically and internationally making future predictions on hospital capacity for surgery difficult. Phillip will take you through some examples of regional differences in procedure trends later in the call. With regard to capital placements, we installed 178 new systems in Q2, 2020. This compares to 273 installs in Q2, 2019 and 237 installs in Q1, 2020. The new installs in Q2, 2020 represent a clinical installed base growth of 9% after accounting for trade-ins. While these numbers are lower than prior year and prior quarter, frankly, they are greater than our expectation coming into the second quarter, due to strong performance in Asia and some larger IDN placements in the U.S. That said, we know the correlation between system utilization in the form of procedure demand and capital availability at hospitals is a strong one. Hospitals will seek to absorb existing capacity before installing the capital. So on average globally, we expect a challenging near to mid-term environment for future capital placements, as COVID-19 wears on and hospital expenditures remain constrained. Because COVID is impacting locales differently, we see significant variability in procedure growth and new system placement interest by region. Marshall will take you through capital placement trends and risks later in the call. Stepping back and evaluating hospital approaches to surgery during this period, we see some principles that are being applied broadly. During local rapid growth of COVID in a hospital catchment area, their initial response is to align and train their workforce, stabilize their PPE and testing capability, and if I see resources are scarce, the first surgeries that can be delayed with a managed risk to the patient. As staff material in ICU resources free up either by diverting patients to alternative sites of care or within the four walls of the hospital, program directors, triaged patients in need of surgery and ramp back up, the sites become less impacted. We have observed that outreach education and diagnostic visits and procedures come back. The surge of COVID in communities that represent our core markets, either from initial spread or secondary growth is occurring now. Add to the significant anecdotal evidence of delayed diagnostic visits for non-COVID illness, and we expect that the recovery tale of surgery will be a long one, likely to last many quarters. The ultimate timing and shape of a recovery remains uncertain. The drivers of a sustained recovery in surgery will likely vary regionally, and may be predicated on the extent and duration of COVID outbreaks, the availability of human, material and physical resources to concurrently treat both COVID and other disease, patient comfort in returning to care centers for diagnostics or treatment, and finally, the relative health of the broader economy and hospital finances. At Intuitive we're focused on those activities and priorities within our control. They are as follows: first, we're focused on the health and well-being of our customers, our employees and our communities. As COVID has ramped in our communities, we instituted employee health and safety protocols, and have been tracking our performance and refining our methods. We're also working with our foundation and others to produce and donate PPE for customers in the communities in which we work and live, having delivered to date to over 1 million pieces of PPE. Second, we focused on inventory and supply chain management. So far, product availability has been strong. Thanks to the relentless work of our supply chain teams and our partners. Third, we implemented our customer financial relief program in the quarter. The timeliness and the design of the program has been well received by our customers. Fourth, we continue to invest in our high priority programs, recognizing that high quality MIS is likely more important in the coming years post-COVID not less so. Fifth, we're evaluating those activities that should be accelerated in the incurrent environment, and for which demand is likely to be durable post-COVID. Finally, we're constraining spend where we believe it is suboptimal in the current environment. Turning to instruments, beginning Q4 this year, we plan to introduce an updated set of select and Arista instruments for use with da Vinci X and XI, that will enable increased use beyond the current 10 years lifespan, part of our extended use program. Extended use will vary from two to eight additional uses per instrument, and is the result of continuous and significant investment in the design and production of our instrument technologies that have resulted in improved quality and durability. In addition, we'll concurrently lower the price of some other instruments that are most commonly used in lower acuity procedures. We are dedicated to support our customers' pursuit of the quadruple aim, defined as better patient outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. The long-term opportunity for our products and services is substantial. Both in high acuity complex procedures and in shorter duration lower acuity cases, where customers are understandably more cost sensitive. Some under risk instruments are used in every procedure. So our extended use program helps all customers, and in particular those performing lower acuity cases, which are among the fastest growing procedures. As the program rolls out, I&A cost for customers performing lower acuity procedures will be highly competitive, with non-robotic MIS approaches. I have described our commitment to a virtuous cycle of value adjustment for our customers driving volume increases, allowing us to invest in design and manufacturing at scale, and giving us the opportunity to share these savings with our customers, to allow them to use our products more broadly. This program is another step in this journey. Our extended use program has been years in the making, and its timing is fortuitous relative to COVID. We're pleased to bring it to our customers now. The program will negatively impact our near-term revenue, but not substantially impact our gross margin for affected instruments. It is the right decision for our customers and therefore for Intuitive long-term. Marshall will take you through financial implications of this program later in the call. Turning to advanced instruments. Our da Vinci Energy platform, which includes our next generation energy instrument and system, SynchroSeal and E-100 have made surprisingly good commercial progress in the second quarter, in spite of current environmental challenges. A testament to customer reception to its speed and precision. We also initiated our first commercial cases for E-100 and SynchroSeal in Japan in the quarter. And lastly, our 45 millimeter SureForm stapler launched in Europe in the second quarter. Turning to other programs of interest. Our Ion program continues to march forward in the face of COVID headwinds. Three systems were placed in the quarter and our clinical trial is progressing. Design and manufacturing teams continue to make progress on incorporating learnings to allow us to drive towards wider distribution in the future. While our progress in our precise trial for Ion has been slowed, we're seeing a return to cases as our clinical trial partners come free. For our SP program, our teams continue to support our early customers. Average monthly utilization for SP in Korea continues to exceed that of XI, a strong positive that speaks to early interest in the platform by surgeons and their patients. In addition to our learning from Korea, we are working with regulatory agencies regarding expansion of indications. The regulatory environment in the U.S. and EU has become more complex for new systems over time, made more challenging by diversion of resources at hospitals and at regulators to fight COVID, which impacts clinical trials and regulatory reviews. We'll update progress on additional indications for SP, as we have greater clarity. In our intelligence and analytics programs, our teams are performing well. And we are leveraging our prior investments in cloud computing, training technologies and analytics prowess. We have focused on our integration of cloud technologies with InTouch to accelerate access to remote proctoring in certain regions. We had already moved to a network subscription model for our simulation technology platform called SimNow, which is helping us decrease travel for surgeons for some elements of surgical training. Use of our hospital analytics programs is accelerating, even through the turbulence of 2020, helping hospitals and us in planning for system use and dynamic times like these. Before concluding my prepared remarks, let's step back. We cannot yet see the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the lessons from this event are absorbed, I believe high quality minimally invasive care will be more important to the future, not less so. A balanced approach to improving the quadruple aim remains our North Star. Our priorities for the next few quarters are as follows: first, continued strong performance on customer employee and community safety, while ensuring supply chain stability. Second, continued support of our customers adapted to their specific conditions, different customers are at different stages in this period, and we'll support them according to their needs. Third, advancing our priority programs, instruments, accessories, endoscopy systems and intelligence programs. And finally disciplined spend management during a period of change. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who’ll take you through financial matters in greater detail.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Key business metrics for the second quarter were as follows: second quarter, 2020 procedures decreased approximately 19% compared with the second quarter of 2019, and decreased approximately 22% compared with last quarter. Second quarter system placements of 178 systems decreased 35% compared with 273 systems last year, and decreased 25% compared with 237 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over last year by 9% to approximately 5,764 systems. This gross rate compares with 11% last quarter and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system declined approximately 27% compared with last year, and declined 23% compared with last quarter. Let me walk through the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on procedures and system placements and how it varied by market. The impact of COVID-19 varied significantly among geographies. To assist in your understanding of this dynamic, we have posted a graph showing U.S., China, Japan, and Germany procedures in Investor Relations portion of our website. In that graph, we compare procedures to the average of the first two complete weeks of the first quarter, which we have characterized as pre-COVID-19 levels. In the U.S., procedure volume started the second quarter at around 30% of pre-COVID-19 levels, and grew by the middle of June to nearly the level measured in the first two weeks of the first quarter. However, with the resurgence of COVID-19 regionally in U.S., and related deferrals of elective surgeries, procedures began to decline in the last weeks of the quarter. We expect to see da Vinci surgeries decline further in July, as the pandemic continues to spread and hospitals dedicate human and physical resources to the treatment of COVID-19 in a way from other procedures. Second quarter procedures in China, Japan and Korea grew well year-over-year, as COVID had a lower impact on these markets. In Europe, the impact of COVID varied widely with Germany experiencing year-over-year single digit growth, while France, UK, and Italy experienced large declines. Capital sales in the U.S. and Europe reflected lower procedures and delayed capital spending, while hospitals revisit their capital budgets, given the impacts of COVID-19. On the other hand, capital sales in several of our Asia direct markets, including China, Japan, and Korea were better than anticipated. System placements will likely continue to be pressured by hospital spending, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and the result into economic pressures. Also, as system utilization declined by 27% year-over-year, hospitals have excess capacity that they will likely seek to fill before purchasing additional systems. The extent and duration of COVID-19 and subsequent resurgences in the U.S. and other parts of the world is uncertain. The time and extent to which da Vinci procedures may recover will vary by market. However, as we believe surgery is durable and with the long-term worldwide opportunity for robotic assisted interventions remain significant. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Second quarter revenue was $852 million, representing a 22% decrease from last year and a 23% decrease from last quarter. Under the previously announced customer relief program, we're providing service credits to customers related to lower use of their systems during the second and third quarters, as hospital treat COVID patients. Revenue reflects $59 million of service credits granted to customers in the second quarter. As procedures in the U.S. and Europe recovered more quickly in the second quarter, the credits issued were less than expected. We are now anticipating the total cost of the customer relief program will be in the range of $80 million to $110 million. Second quarter placements included 21 into China, representing a greater proportion of total placements relative to the prior year in prior quarter. As leasing is prohibited in China and most systems are placed within Greenfield hospitals, the worldwide percent of leasing and trade-ins has declined. Leasing represented 29% of current quarter placements compared with 32% last quarter. Trade-ins represented 40% of current quarter placements compared with 57% last quarter. We would anticipate in an environment of COVID-19 as economic pressures increase, more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. Trade-in activity can be fluctuate and be difficult to predict. We recognized $9 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $12 million last quarter and $27 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure declined to approximately $1,900 per procedure, compared with just over $2,000 procedure in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting hospital usage of existing inventory as procedures decline. We expect instrument and accessory revenue per procedure to fluctuate, as hospitals adjust inventories to reflect changes in procedure volumes. Earlier today, we announced our Extended Use Program, under which in October, we will launch selected X and Xi instruments possessing 12 to 18 uses, compared with our existing 10 use instruments. These extended use instruments represent our higher volume instruments excluding stapler, monopolar and advanced energy instruments that are used in a broad set of procedures. The announcement is posted on our website. Our ability to introduce instruments with extended uses as the result of significant investments in quality and manufacturing processes over a long period of time. The extended use instruments will generally be priced higher than our 10 life instruments, reflecting the investments we've made, but the cost per use will be lower for our customers. In addition and simultaneously, we will lower the price of certain instruments used commonly in lower acuity procedures and/or lower reimbursement procedures, like cholecystectomy, inguinal hernias and benign hysterectomies in the U.S. Combined with the savings associated with extended use instruments, the resultant instrument and accessory cost for these procedures will be competitive with non-robotic MIS approaches. Overall, extended use instruments and lower instrument pricing will result in lower I&A revenue per procedure to Intuitive. For example, had the extended use instruments been available and the lower instrument pricing been in place for all of 2019, revenue for 2019 would have been $150 million to $170 million less than reported, and I&A INA per procedure would have been 7% lower. The impact of these actions on future revenue will be depended upon procedure volumes, instrument usage, mix, and whether cost elasticity will enable greater penetration into available markets. Five of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, reflecting both our measured rollout of SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our rollout of SP surgical system will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experience da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. COVID-19 has delayed the ability to perform the clinical trial associate with an SP colorectal procedure. We placed three Ion systems in the quarter, Ion system placements were also impacted by COVID-19. Ion system placements procedures and related information is excluded from our overall systems and procedure accounts. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured, while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. The completion of the PRECISE study is delayed due to COVID-19, and we cannot predict when the PRECISE clinical study will be completed. Outside the U.S., we placed 72 systems in the second quarter, compared with 80 in the second quarter of 2019 and 55 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 18 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 21 into China, compared with 30 into Europe, 24 into Japan and eight into China in the second quarter of 2019. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 62.4%, compared with 71.3% for the second quarter of 2019, and 69.7% last quarter. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2019 and last quarter, primarily reflects period costs associated with abnormally low production. The customer relief program and higher excess in obsolete inventory charges, partially offset by higher system ASPs reflecting a favorable geographic mix. Second quarter inventory charges were approximately $27 million, primarily reflecting last generation system, vision and instrument products, which as a result of decreased demand we are now able to fulfill customer needs with new or more capable products. As revenues have pressured by COVID-19, the production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor cost and under absorbed overhead in reduced product margins. Pro forma operating expenses increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2019, and decreased 11% compared with last quarter. Spending in the second quarter reflected curtailment of costs associated with the impact of COVID-19, particularly training, marketing events and travel and related expenses, partially offset by cost associated with employee relief programs and other direct costs of COVID-19. Spending during this period of the pandemic will be as follows: we will work to ensure our employees safety and well-being, including investing in PP&E and employee program. We will continue to support our customers. We will continue to invest in innovation focused on the quadruple aim. We will invest in manufacturing in our supply chain to ensure supply for our customers. We will ensure that we are prepared for periods when the spread of COVID-19 is contained. Certain costs will be lower as the underlying activities are restricted by COVID-19, including travel and related expenses, clinical trials, surgeon training and marketing events. We will eliminate spending that is ineffective due to COVID-19, like surgeon and hospital events. We will reduce the hiring of volume-related roles like sales reps and manufacturing employees as appropriate. We continue to believe that we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world, and we’ll continue to invest in the business for the long-term. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 36.9% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%, reflecting a $37 million or $0.31 per diluted share charge associated with the conclusion of a tax case between an independent third-party and the IRS, related to charging foreign subsidiaries for share based compensation. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our second quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $132 million or a $1.11 per share, compared with $388 million or $3.25 per share for the second quarter of 2019, and $323 million or $2.69 per share last quarter. I’ll now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $68 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2020, compared with GAAP net income of $318 million or $2.67 per share for the second quarter of 2019, and GAAP net income of $314 million or $2. 62 per share for the last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition related items, and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.1 billion compared with $5.9 billion at March 31, 2020. Cash generated from operations was partially offset by investment in working capital and our infrastructure. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our current thoughts on capital deployment are in the following order. We recognize the hardship that COVID places on our customers and we will work with customers, to ease the burden of lower da Vinci utilization, including providing customers with more flexible financing. We will ensure secure supply chain and build appropriate levels of inventory to ensure customer supply, particularly as procedures resume. We will invest in securing our customers. We will continue our open market repurchase program consistent with our prior practice. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over our procedure performance.
Philip Kim: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall second quarter procedure decrease was approximately 19%, compared to growth of 17% during the second quarter of 2019, and 10% last quarter. Our Q2 procedure decrease was driven by a 24% decrease in U.S. procedures and a 7% decrease in OUS markets. On a worldwide basis, procedures in the quarter troughed in April and continued to recover throughout the quarter. Although, worldwide procedure run rates trended closer to pre-COVID levels in June, we caution investors from assuming this trend continues, given the dynamics discussed earlier in the call. In the U.S., procedure run rates also trending closer to pre-COVID levels in June. However, future of procedure performance may fluctuate as customers and states like Texas, Florida and California encounter increased COVID cases. From a procedure standpoint during the end of Q2, we saw a broad recovery in most procedures, including procedures that had the biggest decline at the end of Q1, such as bariatrics, hernia and benign gynecology. Within the U.S., there were geographic differences between states that were hit harder by COVID and those that were not. For example, during the quarter Florida recovered to pre-COVID levels on a run-rate basis, while New York did not. State specific containment strategies impacted procedure growth, and the timing of COVID outbreaks will play a role in driving geographic differences. Outside of the U.S., procedure growth in Asia was strong. As shown in the chart on our Investor Relations website, China performance was strong, but we would caution investors not to use China as a proxy for our global recovery. Japan growth remained strong at over 30% in Q2, and South Korea also grew in the quarter. Western Europe saw broad declines with the exception of Germany, which continued to grow in Q2, albeit at a slower rate. We provide these data points to inform investors of the procedure dynamics in the second quarter. Given the uncertain scope and duration of the COVID pandemic and uncertain timing of global recovery and economic normalization, we continue to believe that Q2 procedure results aren't indicative of forward trends. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?
Gary Guthart: We can, David. Yes.
David Lewis: Great. Thanks. A little choppy there. So a couple of questions for me, Gary, for you. Obviously, the focus of the call is going to be on the extended instruments program. So maybe one for you, Gary, which is look, in most technology industries where you democratize technology sort of lower price to drive the TAM. I'm sure you've extensively studied your customer elasticity. And so Marshall talked about a 7% drop in I&A revenue. Can you just give us a sense of a framework around how to think about improvement in utilization based on these cost improvements? And then also for you, given your competitors who've seen J&J Medtronic time line slip, I think some investors are going to say, why take this kind of move now when the competitive landscape is getting easier. And then I had a quick follow-up for Marshall.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Thank you. I appreciate the question. On the first question of do we think that it changes the volume of procedures that might be accessed by our technology? The answer to that is yes. I think the real question will be timeline. A little bit hard to predict the timeline in the near-term just because I think a lot of it will have to do with COVID and recovery. So that will kind of blur the speed with which it happens. But if you look out over a couple of years, we clearly think that customers want to use our products, they want to use them broadly and different procedure domains, like general surgery but also broadly regionally. And to the extent that we can help them with economics, we think they have a preference to use our products, and we think that will help, that’s why we did it. On question two on timeline, we have been working at it for some time. These changes and manufacturing process improvements have taken years to get right. I think being a little too fancy in the timeline doesn't help the company or our customers, we think that it will be appreciated that we have done it, it will be appreciated that we have done it now. And overtime, I think we’ll look back on it and be happy what we thought it as expeditiously as we could.
David Lewis: Okay, very helpful. And then Marshall for you, I appreciate the commentary on 2019 on revenue, and I apologize if I missed it. The 7% or $170 million -ish type of revenue impact. Can you give us a sense of what the gross margin impact, gross or EBIT impact maybe gross would be more helpful on 2019? Just trying to get a sense of the gross margin mix shift into '21 on this I&A study use program change. Thanks so much.
Marshall Mohr: Sure. The margin on the products will be relatively consistent with current margins, so the impact is nominal in terms of 2019. It’s a slight down only because you have less instrument and accessory revenue. And from a mix perspective, you wind up with more systems revenue, and systems revenue have lower margins, but the individual margins on the instruments are not that different.
Operator: Our next question will be from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Thanks. Gary I have a question on the capital side. If I go back to last quarter you obviously talked about using the $6 million in balance sheet to place more systems. Operating leases did go down. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about that dynamic, what you’re hearing from customers in particular and U.S. on operating leases? And to Dave's point before with their competitors delayed a little bit, does that change your appetite at all for pushing operating leases in this current environment?
Gary Guthart: Yes. So just sanding back to the capital, it's really variable regionally, so where they are not strongly affected by COVID or they’re recovering strongly then capital rotates forward again you saw that in China. And there we feel good about leasing systems or selling systems. In China they buy them, they don’t lease them, but in other markets, where they are interested in leasing, we’re happy to do that. In regions that are being disrupted by COVID where the flow of patients is changing because of either delays like surgery, or delays in diagnostic pipelines, there they have capacity on the existing installed base. They may want to move those systems, they may want to upgrade them, but in general we have seen and we have seen this in years past, act one as an operator of a hospital was to use your existing capacity before expanding it. And there, I don’t think leasing is the major issue. I think the real issue is them getting back to surgery and getting ready to the extent that they have demand, leasing helps us, so I think it's kind of secondary to recovery from COVID in the U.S. primarily.
Tycho Peterson: And then on the procedure recovery, just speaking about looking to the backlog of the patients, is there any some more patients going into laparoscopic or open as there is backlog on robotics or even radiation therapy. I am just curious about how you think about alternatives to robotics, given backlog today?
Gary Guthart: Yes, we get to ask like questions periodically. I don’t see a philosophical shift by heads of perioperative services to try to shift share in response to COVID. In a really hard hit area, if they are doing everything they can and the only thing they have available is something other than MIS they might go that way, I don’t think that’s their r primary objective of the health system. And pretty quickly they want to return to what they believe is offering the patient the best outcome. Looking in the evidence, we don’t see any evidence of share shifts at this time. Let’s not say they aren’t there, it's just that nothing has really come up. And what we do see is as much positive for robotics as anything else.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. I'll leave it with that. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will be from Bob Hopkins, with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: Great, thank you. Can you hear me okay?
Gary Guthart: Yes.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Hi, Gary. Thank you for taking the questions. First one for me, I am just trying to understand hospital systems ability to kind of manage through this COVID increase in cases that we're seeing here of late. So I'm just curious has that increase in the United States in particular been disruptive to surgical volumes or things held steady despite the uptick in cases?
Gary Guthart: We've seen -- it really depends regionally. So I guess what we've seen is variance regionally. And hard hit areas we'll see the implementation of deferrals again in other places that had kind of round one and it is starting to creep back in. They're assuming to manage it concurrently a little bit better. Netting it out the first few weeks in July looks really wavy, hard to call a good trend certainly would not call it a recovery in July in the United States.
Bob Hopkins: Yes, it's okay. I was specifically asking about the U.S. But it sounds like your response was related to the U.S. too.
Gary Guthart: Yes, certainly true in the U.S.
Bob Hopkins: Okay. And then the second question I had was just on the capital environment. And I know you just made a comment there earlier. But these results -- it's not obvious that there was a big negative impact from COVID on capital. But, you made a comment about a challenging environment going forward. I'm wondering how much of that is the need to absorb capacity, versus the impact on COVID? I'm just wondering specifically in the U.S., the willingness to kind of purchase capital in this environment? Just would love an update there. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Sure. So, we did see -- as we reach the end of the quarter, we did see additional postponements of purchases. And we did hear from hospitals that they were back to evaluating their budget, thinking about what the ramifications of the costs of COVID treatment were, as well as thinking about the longer-term impacts of COVID in terms of potential recession and impact on their funds. And so I think, the quarter was affected. The capital quarter was affected by COVID. And going forward, you're right, there will be first, we think the impact of trying to bring back up systems to full utilization. 27% is a pretty steep decline. And we would expect that they will seek to fill that before they go out and buy more capital, particularly when they're already strained on the financial side. So, I think if we started to see it this quarter, and I think we're going to continue to see pressures on capital spend.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will be from line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. One on capital, one on the regulatory environment. Gary, obviously system shift greatly exceeded street expectations this quarter. Can you talk about any new programs? You've introduced to support new placement? And we heard you talk this quarter about the loaner program. Are there any commitments associated with that? And are usage-based agreements increasing? As I said, I had one follow-up on the regulatory environment.
Gary Guthart: Sure. On that system shifts in the quarter, I'll start to answer and I'll ask Marshall to jump in and provide a little additional color. I think a lot of what we saw in Q2, in the U.S. was around momentum. Capital pipelines are multi-month engagements for our sales teams and for our customers. They have long-term commitments. They're fairly far down the pipeline. And in some cases, I think they know they want to do this long-term. They went ahead and closed. Outside to us, we had strength because you're starting to see procedure recoveries. And they're looking to build capacity for additional procedures. With regard to whether a particular sales program or the introduction of a loaner program and so on that really drove that number. I would not guide you that way. I don't really think that's true. But Marshall wanted to step in.
Marshall Mohr: I think you characterized it right. I don't think there was any particular program that drove it. And I think that it really does reflect momentum. Gary alluded to a couple of larger IDN deals getting done. Those were months, if not a year in the making and so it takes time to get them closed out. And when you're getting close, even though there's COVID virus, they went ahead. And we do see strength outside the U.S., particularly in Asia where our COVID has started to recover.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks, Marshall. And just for my follow-up, Gary. You talked about changes to the regulatory environment. Obviously, we all heard J&J saying that they're not going to be filing 510(k) for their robot in the U.S. I mean, what are you seeing Gary? At the FDA, do you think future surgical robots will de Novo 510(k)s PMAs, I obviously don’t expect you to speak for J&J but what can you talk about generally on surgical robots?
Gary Guthart: Over the last few years we’ve seen an increase in clinical data requirements and evidenced generation per new platform, as we come out and we’ve been talking to you about that over last several years. With regard to introducing new platforms us or anybody else, I think the pathway depends on the details of the claims, what’s being claimed, what procedures are being done, and the details of the predicates being used. And that would guide any of the conversations we would have with FDA, or frankly, our competitors would have. So I really can’t call out what direction it will go for everybody. We do see the discussions being pretty rational, and they just have required additional data sets as time goes on, and nothing we’ve heard from the last couple of weeks of earnings calls as kind of changed our perspective on what we've seen.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question will go to Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Larry Keusch: Thanks, good afternoon. Gary, I'm just curious about how you’re able to manage your internal R&D development projects throughout COVID? And I guess really the question is, are you able to keep things going or did you see setbacks as well? I mean I know you talked about the PRECISE trial again, but I'm really thinking sort of your internal development projects.
Gary Guthart: I think we’ve seen both heroic effort on the part of our teams. We are blessed by having a medical office inside the company and surgeons and medical people who work for the company directly. So we implemented protocols that allowed us to stay at leading edge of where safety protocols ought to be for infectious disease, and do our best to be able to keep making work, making progress. Our engineering teams have been really creative and thoughtful about getting work done. So we have seen some delays for sure. I wish I would say otherwise, but it’s just reality. That said, I think that the teams have thought pretty hard to keep our programs progressing and to not just accept slips because COVID exists. Where we are -- where those things are a little bit out of our control tend to be on things that are in clinical trials, as we mentioned, there you’re going back and forth between hospital, institution on the frontlines. They are using the point of their resources and ways that are important to them to manage COVID, we fully understand that. So there sometime it’s really us in the support mode. Where we can control it? We can control our environment, we can relay out our spaces, our labs and so on, and we can make a little more progress. So we see some slips but we also see great effort to manage the slips.
Larry Keusch: Okay, terrific. And then the other question is, certainly there is a sense out there that COVID will sort of accelerate trend that we’ve already been seeing and a move to some sort of ambulatory surgical setting. Just curious, in the last quarter’s call you sort of mentioned that Intuitive organization was ready to be helpful in any way and certainly sound like, what was implied if robots need to be moved to either ASCs or other care areas that you’d be prepared to do it. Did you actually see any of that occur? And do you think that there is going to be an accelerated trend to move things that you can into non-acute care settings?
Gary Guthart: I'm going to ask Marshall answer the first part of that question around have we seen acceleration in the data set and then I’ll answer the second part of question around what do we think might happen going forward. So, Marshall if you would jump in on what we've seen so far?
Marshall Mohr: In terms of ASCs, again ASC is the number of da Vinci type procedures, procedures that da Vinci addresses in ASCs is actually not all the significant. What you really -- if you are talking about HOPDs or ASCs that are owned by hospital IDNs, then we have a large presence and we are addressing procedures that are presented there. We haven't seen -- I haven't, I'm not aware of movements of large patient quantities to ASCs during this period. I think hospitals are struggling to meet all needs in terms of COVID. So, I don't think I have anything else to add there.
Gary Guthart: Yes, I'll jump in on my side. I think that surgery in those environments, what actually happens in the operating room is well understood. And robotics and all robotics can play a real role there. What really determines whether something's in an ambulatory setting, hospital-owned, outpatient department setting or inside a hospital and booked as the same day surgery the differences there are largely driven by reimbursement and reimbursement policy. To the extent that reimbursement policy stays as it is, then I don't think you'll see a huge move of the kind of procedures that Intuitive does into the ASCs. But if reimbursement policy were to change in the future, then we will change with it and go there. So there's a lot of same day surgery or outpatient surgery that's done on da Vinci devices, where they live has a lot to do with reimbursement. So for us, it's -- where does it make sense to be performed logistically, where does it make sense to be performed from a reimbursement perspective and then they have the right tools, technologies and training. And I think we can adjust to that over time.
Larry Keusch: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Thanks. Hey, good afternoon. Just a couple quick ones. On the da Vinci SP, if I heard your comments right about Korea utilization being higher than XI. That was a little bit surprising. So I'm just curious if you can give some color behind that. And whether that suggests for you that the types of procedures being done on SP are kind of more on the lower acuity side of the spectrum? And whether that kind of pays for you how you might be marketing the product here as it evolves.
Gary Guthart: Yes. In Korea, the nice thing is that the regulatory clearance allows broad clinical application. As a result, they can do procedures in urology and thoracic and gynecology and head and neck. And they're also looking at procedures in the breast. There I think it's less about low acuity. And I think they're really exploring, where does the single incision or natural orifice approach really drive clinical value up. The surgeons are I think, thoughtful and innovative here. And that's exciting to us. In the U.S., we need to run trials and get additional data as we've said before for colorectal applications and for some of the other things that we have in the pipeline. So that will take us some time. So we look to Korea to say, okay, what does demand look like when not constrained by the regulatory setting? The nice utilization or high throughput sort of tells us two things. One is, there's a real interest in exploring the hypothesis that this creates better outcomes. We can also look at the data there and start to see where it does indeed. That's exciting. The second thing is it puts the product through the tests of high throughput high turnaround is a well-designed in that setting. And can they use it as much? And that's been powerful for learning but also encouraging for us as to the maturity of the product even at this early stage. So that's how we're looking at Korea and it will help inform our regulatory strategy in other parts of the world.
Amit Hazan: And then my follow-up would be on just new doctor training. That was obviously still quite strong for you pre-COVID here in the U.S. and obviously been a key element for you procedure growth looking forward. So just qualitatively, are you able to just give us a sense of the impact on training that you saw in the quarter? And how you're thinking about the rest of the year? Just levels of normal, even like you did for procedure would be super helpful to just get a sense of where you are with being able to train new doctors?
Gary Guthart: Yes, I'll start and Marshall will help you. I'll ask you to jump in and add some color. It's clearly challenged, and one of the things that we're working on. First, right up front is particularly in the United States, doctors are focused on other things and travel which some training requires is strained. So for us, two things have been going on. One of them is to see if we can forward deploy our training assets to make travel easier or extremely convenient, travel by car for example rather than by plane or use of digital tools and cloud technologies to be able to get access to some of the materials that they might use. We're actually encouraged on that front, I think we have some investments we have made over the years that we can leverage to help and we’re seeing the beginnings of that. So I think that side looks good. That said, training requires demand generation, requires interactions with our sales teams in addition to training once they get going. So its substantially below prior levels, we’re starting to see the beginnings of it coming back, but I’ll let Marshal give you a little bit of color there.
Marshall Mohr: Yes, it has been below our historical levels. And the importance of it varies depending on the geography as well. So we’re in -- let's say in Japan where you have newer procedures that you’re trying to adopt, training becomes a more important element and let’s say in the United States where people can otherwise be trained in their institutions or that we’re talking about mature procedures where proctoring and so forth is more readily available. So, I think in the United States the contribution of new surgeons is much lower than let’s say in geography like Japan. And so we did see quite a drop-off in training earlier in the United States, because of reluctance to travel and other COVID-related reasons. And as Gary said, we’re finding other ways to perform in that training, and it could have some impact on us, but again, it's not as big a contributor in the United States as our existing surgeons.
Amit Hazan: Thank you.
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Good afternoon, Gary and Marshall. I was reflecting again about the delayed J&J program and about, I think you said it or Marshall said it Intuitive's unique opportunity to invest. Help us think about this. I have to imagine that in some way perhaps many ways Intuitive has been actively aggressively thinking about the challenge preparing for near-term and long-term for the possibility of more competition. That challenge would seem to be meaningfully delayed for the moment. Does this offer you in anyway any opportunity to accelerate the pipeline or accelerate spending in some kind of way? Does this window present an opportunity? It does present you some kind of unique opportunity to investment? You're going to do something different now than you would have if it has been more imminent?
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Rick. For us we have really focused on being tightly focused on really making measurable improvements to the quad aim, really looking forward looking through windshield rather than in the side mirrors as to what, we think is important. I guess what I’d say is the greatest limitation for us so far has not been opportunity, I think to do interesting things. There's an enormous amount of opportunity out there to make improvements and there's an enormous technology opportunity. I think the biggest challenge in the great limiting step for us has really been to continue to deploy our programs with excellence. And so that’s been rate limiting step on growth. I think that other companies out there are investing in things that make sense that are interesting. I think the vision about where the world might be in 10 or 15 years is not a complicated one, I think it’s reasonably shared. And I think what will differentiate Intuitive and other companies is really the ability to deliver these complex technologies at a very high quality level, and then ways that customers can really use to access their resources. So, I look around at what’s going on outside, and I think they are engaging some of the both opportunities that are out there in the world and some of the challenges of doing this well and delivering it. So for us, I guess I didn’t wake up this week and think that the world has changed because of somebody else's conference call.
Rick Wise: And just the second question for me. On Monday, we presented 100 plus robotic surgeon survey. And of those who said they had wanted to buy eventually, 40% said that they were -- they had made a decision to now postpone. Not a big shock. And you're corroborating that, of course. But how are you thinking? How would you have us think about that postponed volume? Are you concerned at all that these orders are lost? And could we see a sharp resurgence in capital as normal demand continues, you opened those accounts, new procedures? And on top of that we see these postpone volume, is that the right way to think about it? Thanks, Gary.
Gary Guthart: Okay. I think there's two drivers of additional capital. One of them is the need for additional capacity driven by surgeon and patient demand for da Vinci procedures. To the extent that that demand is suppressed because of COVID, fears about COVID or delays in diagnostic pipelines that will pressure the capital pipeline. That varies regionally. So where COVID is well-managed, we see knock on the usual types of sales activities, where COVID is very intense, not surprisingly, they were focused on other things. The second thing that can drive capital demand is new features, product that they want access to because they have older technology. And in that case, if they have the attention span to pursue it and the capital or leasing dollars to do something about it, then we can continue to make progress. The prior one, the issue of absorbing existing demand in the field -- procedure demand in the field will be the dominant one in my opinion in the next few months. How long that lasts has a lot to do with COVID and really none of us know how long that will be. So we'll be ready, we'll react. We are in a strong position from an organization point of view. I think we are able to run the business for the long-term. And so we'll do our best in that period. And we'll see it as it as it plays out.
Rick Wise: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Well, that was our last question. Thank you. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams, in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim:better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately a lower total cost to treat of care. We believe value creation, surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Ladies, gentlemen, that will conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-16 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you standing by and welcome to Intuitive Surgical Q1 2020 Earnings Release. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive’s first quarter earnings conference call.

Today’s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. In addition, this quarter, we have also posted charts illustrating da Vinci procedure trends in Q1, which are intended to provide additional perspective and detail regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure details. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter 2020 performance reflects the rise of COVID-19 and the global response to it. On this call, we will describe our experience in the quarter, our framework for engaging those who rely on us and our priorities and actions in these challenging times. Our focus now and in the past is the safety and well-being of patients, care teams, our communities and our employees. For the first 2.5 months of the quarter, procedure performance was at the high-end of our expectations with procedure trends consistent with the prior quarters. General surgery in the United States was strong as was urology outside the United States. As we disclosed previously, recommendations by surgical societies and healthcare organizations to delay certain surgeries to conserve resources for COVID Care are having a material impact on surgery broadly, including robotic-assisted surgery. We support government and hospital policies to direct resources to COVID Care and recognize these policies very greatly by region and by hospital system. We are analyzing customer procedure deferrals in response to COVID. Patients undergoing da Vinci procedures do so in response to an underlying disease. While these procedures maybe delayed in the short-term without treatment of some sort, the disease in its impairment persist and often worsens. Said simply, the vast majority of these patients will ultimately see treatment. We are analyzing both the clinical drivers of return to treatment and customer plans and processes to recover. The categories of benign disease and cancer are not entirely predictive of the urgency of surgical intervention. Clearly, aggressive cancers require treatment and are delayed at significant risk to patients. Likewise, some benign conditions require timely intervention as well. We are working internally and with customers to understand their needs to restart surgery for those patients whose condition requires action. The effect of COVID on the surgical market has impacted different regions differently. Starting with China, procedure performance was impacted by COVID earliest with sharp declines in surgery as resources were diverted to respond to COVID Care. Procedures in China have been recovering steadily since that time. However, steep declines in procedures that can be deferred are occurring in other regions, particularly Europe and the United States. For the quarter, procedures grew 10% over Q1 of 2019 given early strength followed by sharp declines in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. I refer you to the materials we posted to our website prior to this call to get a better picture of the dynamics in Q1. With regard to systems, our total number of placements for the quarter was below our expectations in spite of having strong capital performance in the first 2 months of the quarter. In March, rapid changes by hospitals delayed some system placements and are likely to significantly impact system contracts and placements in future quarters. Financial pressures exerted on hospitals in response to treating COVID patients and deferring other care, are likely to be significant and are unlikely to resolve quickly. Marshall and Calvin will take you through procedure and capital dynamics in the quarter in greater detail later in the call. To help articulate our priorities and actions during this period of change, we have adopted the phased framework described in the American Enterprise Institute’s national coronavirus response. In Phase 1, which is the slow-the-spread phase of coronavirus response, Intuitive’s priorities are as follows. First, we are focused on the health and safety of all those we serve, our customers, our communities, our employees and our suppliers implementing early and continuous updates to our health and safety policies and processes. Second, we are supporting our customers according to their priorities, clinical, operational and economic. Third, we are focused on continuity of supply by working with our suppliers and distributors. To-date, our delivery capability and inventory positions are on firm footing. Fourth, we are securing our workforce economically. We have built an outstanding team over the years and we believe their strength will be essential in the recovery that follows. Fifth, in partnership with our Intuitive Foundation, we are contributing material product and volunteers to the frontlines of COVID support. We have designed, produced and delivered PPE to local hospitals and our staff have volunteered in several communities. And sixth, we are eliminating avoidable spend during the stop-the-spread phase of the virus. The current situation in hospitals responding to viral care is fluid and the depth and duration of this disruption is difficult to predict. New issues are arising with respect to surgery that will require mitigation in time. Some hospital customers and some of our suppliers will experience significant financial stress in this period. Regulatory agency priorities and resources are shifting globally as they devote their resources to infectious disease detection and treatment needs. And lastly, surgeons are being dedicated to frontline COVID work or being idled by a lack of resources in this period. We are adjusting quickly to the issues described and we are confident in both the need for surgery and in our products as the response to COVID evolves. We are planning for Phase 2 to return to surgery for those patients who can’t wait. Those countries that have been managing the disease the longest have returned to da Vinci surgery steadily over time or have been able to maintain da Vinci surgery concurrently with COVID Care. We are analyzing the order in which different procedures are likely to return and the strategies likely to be employed by hospital systems to manage surgical practices while still providing COVID Care. For example, some health systems are dedicating specific sites to COVID Care, while operating rooms for outpatient surgeries are dedicated in other locations. We will support customers closely as they bring capabilities back online. We are also adapting our training in Intuitive telepresence capabilities to support team training and skills retention in a Phase 2 world. We are optimizing our R&D facilities and methods to allow us to progress on important innovation programs while employing up-to-date workplace safety guidelines. Lastly, we look forward to accelerating clinical trial activities and the associated regulatory work as trial sites increased their surgical volume. In constructing our financial plans in the current environment, we are balancing five objectives that reflect our priorities mentioned above. They are: first, customer-focused economic policies that meet their needs during this disruption; second, employee policies that secure our valuable workforce needed for hospital recovery and to drive our innovation; third, securing and stabilizing critical supply chain resources; fourth, eliminating spending that is not effective during this period, for example, pausing, hiring and volume-related roles and spend on projects that cannot progress in the current phase; and finally, shareholder policies that don’t interfere with the priorities mentioned above. We remain in close contact with our customers, our community representatives, our employees and our suppliers during this period. While the depth and duration of the current challenges are difficult to predict, the need for both COVID and non-COVID Care is clear. Given time and resources, health systems have continued to choose da Vinci. The collaborations and solutions orientation among our stakeholders is clear and inspiring. I believe our long-term opportunity is substantial and our business is well-positioned financially and organizationally to weather this COVID outbreak. And I will now turn the call over to Marshall who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Procedures and shipments are consistent with our preliminary press release of April 8th. Key business metrics for the first quarter were as follows: First quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 10% compared with the first quarter of 2019 and decreased approximately 9% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. First quarter system placements of 237 systems increased 1% compared with 235 systems last year and decreased 29% compared with 336 systems last quarter. We expanded our install base of da Vinci systems by 11% to approximately 5,669 systems. This growth rate compares with 12% in the last quarter and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system declined approximately 2% compared with 6% growth last quarter and 5% growth last year. Let me walk through the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on procedures and system placements and how it varied by market. Prior to the spread of COVID-19, we experienced procedure growth trends consistent with those experienced in the fourth quarter, including strength in general surgery, growth in mature procedures in U.S. and growth in O-U.S. urology. We also saw early strength in capital placements, particularly in U.S., with over half the systems placed in the quarter being arrangements where the sales cycle was mostly completed in the fourth quarter. Beginning in January, we saw substantial reduction in da Vinci procedures in China, and by early February, procedures per week in China had declined by 90% compared with the weekly rates experienced in early January. As the COVID-19 subsided in China in March, da Vinci procedures began to recover, and by the end of the quarter, China procedures per week were approximately 70% of the early January rate. We saw varied impacts on da Vinci procedures in some other early countries affected by COVID-19. COVID-19 had little impact in Korea and Japan in the quarter and severe impact in Italy. In summary, the COVID-19 disruption to da Vinci procedures varied by country and the disruption to worldwide da Vinci procedures was not significant through the middle of March. As the pandemic spread to Western Europe and to the U.S., we experienced a significant decline in da Vinci procedures in the last half of March. Procedures per week in the U.S., which represented approximately 70% of our procedures in 2019, declined approximately 65% relative to earlier in the quarter. Procedures in France, Germany and the UK also declined but to a lesser extent than the U.S. We have provided you with supplemental information on our website to enable you to understand the magnitude of the impacts on procedures and the variation between countries. As I indicated most of the sales cycle for approximately half of the system placements in the quarter were completed in the fourth quarter. As we progressed through the quarter and the impact of the pandemic progressed, customers deferred decisions to purchase or lease systems into future quarters and in some cases indefinitely. The depth and extent to which COVID-19 will impact individual markets will vary based on the availability of testing capabilities, PPE, ICUs and ORs, medical staff and government interventions. As COVID-19 continues to spread, it is likely that da Vinci procedures will decline from those experienced in the first quarter. In addition, we would expect that system placements will follow the decline in procedures. While some markets like China appear to be recovering, it is possible that a recurrence of COVID-19 will negatively impact da Vinci procedures. And not all markets will recover at the same pace. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Utilization of the install base declined by 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on procedures coupled with the fourth quarter system placement strength. When procedures increase, customers will first look to utilize existing da Vinci capacity, which is likely to depress capital placements. First quarter placements included a higher concentration of multiple system arrangements with hospitals and IDNs seeking to standardize on fourth generation systems. Many of these replacements were completed as capital leases. As a result, first quarter trade-ins were higher and operating leases were lower as a percentage of total placements than in the fourth quarter of 2019. We would anticipate in an environment of COVID-19 as economic pressures increase, more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than purchases. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. However, given the impacts of COVID-19, we expect the number of trade-ins to decrease. We recognized $12 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter compared with $34 million last quarter and $12 million last year. There were no returns of da Vinci systems for leases that ended in the quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure grew to just over $2,000 per procedure compared with $1,980 in the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting instruments and accessory purchases prior to the decline in procedures. We expect that as hospitals adjust inventory levels for lower surgery volumes, instrument and accessory revenue will decrease. Three of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems reflecting both our measured rollout of SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our rollout of SP Surgical System will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Given the impact of COVID-19, our ability to perform clinical trial associated with an SP colorectal procedure is likely delayed. We placed eight Ion systems in the quarter. Ion system placements were also impacted by COVID-19. Ion system placements are excluded from our overall systems count and will be reported separately. Procedures and other information associated with Ion are excluded from our prepared remarks and will be reported separately when they become material. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. The completion of the PRECISE study will be delayed due to COVID-19. We cannot predict when the PRECISE clinical study will be completed. Outside the U.S., we placed 55 systems in the first quarter compared with 81 in the first quarter of 2019 and 140 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 25 in Europe, 10 into Japan and 9 into China compared with 49 into Europe, 13 into Japan and 3 into China in the first quarter of 2019. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was 69.7% compared with 71.2% for the first quarter of 2019 and 72.2% last quarter. The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2019 and last quarter primarily reflects product mix, higher fixed cost with on lower production and costs associated with Si product transitions partially offset by cost reductions. As revenues are pressured by COVID-19, we will reduce production levels, which will result in higher labor costs and under-absorbed overhead and a significant reduction of product margin. Pro forma operating expenses increased 15% compared with the first quarter 2019 and decreased 8% compared with last quarter. Spending in the first quarter reflected normal business activities into March and a curtailment of cost associated with impact of COVID-19. While certain spending will decrease in the second quarter as a result of the reduction in revenue and activities limited by the pandemic, much of our spending will continue. Major categories of spending and likely trends for the second quarter are as follows: We will continue to support our customers. We will continue to invest in innovation focused on the quadruple aim. We will invest in manufacturing in our supply chain to ensure supply for our customers. We will ensure we are prepared for periods when the spread of COVID-19 is contained. Certain costs will decline as underlying activities are restricted by COVID-19, including travel and related expenses, clinical trials, surgeon training and customer data collection. We will eliminate spending that is ineffective due to COVID-19 like surgeon and hospital events. We are pausing the hiring of volume-related roles like sales reps and manufacturing employees. We continue to believe that we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefit for computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world and will continue to invest in the business for the long-term. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%, reflecting geographic mix. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities, and with the impact of one-time items. Our first quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $323 million or $2.69 per share compared with $312 million or $2.61 per share for the first quarter of 2019 and $417 million or $3.48 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $314 million or $2.62 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with GAAP net income of $307 million or $2.56 per share for the first quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $358 million or $2.99 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified in our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.9 billion compared with $5.8 billion at December 31, 2019. Cash generated from operations was partially offset by stock repurchases and investments in working capital and our infrastructure. We repurchased approximately 192,000 shares for $100 million at an average price of $522 per share. Our current thoughts on capital deployment are in the following order. We recognized the hardships that COVID places on our customers and we work with customers to ease the burden of lower da Vinci utilization, including providing customers with more flexible financing. We will work to secure our supply chain and build appropriate levels of inventory to ensure customer supply, particularly as procedures resume. We will invest in securing our employees. We will continue to our open market repurchase program consistent with our prior practice. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was approximately 10% compared to 18% during the first quarter of 2019 and 19% last quarter. Our Q1 procedure growth was driven by 9% growth in U.S. procedures and 11% growth in o-U.S. markets. Our lower first quarter 2020 procedure growth rates were a direct result of hospitals reallocating resources to meet the increasing demands of managing COVID-19. Hospitals postponed deferrable surgical procedures to make more resources available to treat COVID-19 patients. Impacts to da Vinci procedure volumes were first felt in China in January and moved to other o-U.S. markets as the quarter progressed. As of mid-March, our overall procedures were trending towards the higher end of our expectations, including the benefit of an extra working day in Q1 2020. At this stage of the quarter, the impacts of COVID-19 in the earlier impacted countries were offset by strength in U.S. general surgery and mature procedures. Beginning in mid-March, we saw significant declines in procedure volume in the U.S. and Western Europe. On a worldwide basis, weekly procedures performed exiting Q1 were approximately 50% lower than the run-rate through mid-March. In the U.S., weekly procedures exiting the quarter were approximately 65% below the run-rate through mid-March. Procedures categories realizing significant declines were hernia repair, benign gynecology and bariatric procedures. Lesser impacted procedures were thoracic and colorectal surgeries. Outside of the United States, weekly procedures exiting the quarter were approximately 25% below the run-rate through mid-March. The lower o-U.S. decline primarily reflects procedure volume recoveries in China offset by broad declines in Western Europe. In Q1, procedures in Japan were less affected by COVID-19. Growth in Japan procedures continued at a growth rate over 40%. We provide these data points to inform investors of the procedure dynamics experienced during the first quarter, which were unprecedented. Due to the uncertain scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertain timing of global recovery and economic normalization, we withdrew our financial and procedure guidance on April 8, and these Q1 procedure results aren’t necessarily indicative of any forward-looking trend. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Can you hear me?
Gary Guthart: We can. Hi, David.
David Lewis: Okay. Sorry about that. I am not sure what happened. So, Gary, just want to talk about capital cycle a little bit. I mean, I know we’re not going to get specifics on 2020, but if I think about the 2008 financial crisis, the strain on hospitals is certainly different today than it was back in 2008 and your business model frankly is very different today than it was back in 2008. How would you compare and contrast sort of the impact on your business through COVID-19 relative to what we saw in the last major financial crisis impacting hospitals? And I had a quick follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Yes, thank you. I would start with I think they’re apples and oranges from the underlying cause. So clearly this is healthcare related and policy driven in terms of deferrals, as a result a little bit hard to predict how the capital cycle will recover. You had mentioned and it’s true, we have a lot more flexible approaches that are available to us with regard to making systems available. Marshall mentioned in his script they’ll consume existing capacity first as they go. We’ve been in contact with our customers routinely. There’s a backlog growing for surgery. These folks are going to need surgery. And really our opportunity, our job as a company is to make sure we can support them however we can in terms of access to systems or motion of systems to allow them to use what they have out there, and as those systems become full again, we can think about how to increase capacity going forward and we have a few tools in the tool kit. Marshall, anything you would like to add?
Marshall Mohr: No, I think you hit it. I think you will see more financing, more leases and alternative financing arrangements.
David Lewis: Okay. That made perfect sense. And just a quick follow up on capital, Marshall, for you. You talked about in your script a couple of things, but you talked about certain orders that are being delayed or canceled versus sort of pushed indefinitely. Can you give us any sense from a percentage perspective what percent of the order book was in your mind delayed versus sort of what was either canceled or indefinitely delayed? And then you just mentioned lease rate, you’ve been hovering around that 40% level. Is it reasonable to assume we should see a more material step-up in the lease rate? You said it would fluctuate as it has normally. But in my view would be that lease rate could hike up more materially now because you are incentivized to provide flexibility financing for hospitals to get these systems in. So, any color there would be very helpful, and I’ll jump back in queue. Thank you.
Marshall Mohr: Sure. For leasing, yes, in the quarter what happened, we had a number of customers that had started the sales cycle back in Q4 and were interested in standardizing on fourth generation systems and it so happens that a number of those customers wanted to do – wanted to structure the arrangement such as they were purchases, they were accounted for as purchases, and as a result, we had fewer leases this quarter. So, I don’t think this quarter’s indicative of our normal sort of run rate for leases as a result. Leasing going forward probably is more akin to what we were experiencing, more in the 38% range. That’s under normal circumstances and I actually believe, given the COVID virus and its impacts that it will increase from there. But it’s hard to predict depending on the customer and the circumstances. As far as how many customers may have postponed indefinitely or may have postponed a quarter, the conversations with them are always a little bit, hey, we are going to postpone and then they sort of throw in words about maybe another quarter, maybe another couple of quarters and some say, well, we’ll get back to it but we don’t have a specific timetable, and for those that say that they don’t have a specific timetable that’s what I’m referring to as indefinitely. I don’t think that there are customers running from robotic surgery. I think they actually want to do robotic surgery and I think that they will come back some time when COVID virus is handled and the procedures come back.
David Lewis: Okay. Thank you so much.
Gary Guthart: Next question, please.
Operator: Yes. The next question will come from Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: Sure. Thank you and good afternoon. I want to thank you for the incremental data that you provided this quarter on the trends throughout the quarter by geography. That was very helpful to see. And so my first question is really on the chart on China, was showing a pretty nice recovery from [indiscernible] to where you are right now. I was wondering if you could just walk through your views on how good a proxy China might be for a U.S. recovery, like why or why not. How could that be different? Just your general thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Bob. Yes, you see in that chart China, you see other countries as well, Japan and so on, and what you can really see is that country policy changes the shape. I think we’re encouraged by a couple of things. One is people’s interest or customers’ interest in using da Vinci is durable. That’s been great. You had asked a specific question of how predictive is China and I think the answer there is too soon to tell for the rest of the regions. I’m encouraged by it. I think it indicates the durability of demand. Having said that, I think policy matters and I think how people allocate their healthcare resources are going to change too. You can see in Japan already that the progress of their approach to disease is evolving and what that looks like on procedures will evolve. So, stay tuned is the short answer. Calvin, anything you’d like to add?
Calvin Darling: No, I think that described it pretty well.
Bob Hopkins: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up, yes, just maybe a comment on why Japan has been so resilient? And then you did mention in the prepared remarks something about – I think I missed it on one of the clinical trials that’s been delayed, was wondering if you could highlight or reiterate exactly what you were communicating there? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Okay. On the Japan side, I think that in general their system for managing their coronavirus is a little bit different than we’ve seen in other countries and it’s evolving in time. So, to-date, hospital operations were relatively lightly impacted as it relates to surgery relative to other countries. What that will look like in the future, I don’t know. We’ll see how that evolves. It’s been interesting and instructive for us to look at data from Japan, look at data from Korea, from China, from Europe and Germany, Italy, UK, France. And that informs us going forward and in terms of getting prepared for the reopening of some of the hospital wings and surgical wings as they happen. So too soon to make the final call, but we have I think pretty good real-time information. I’m going to refer to Marshall the question about clinical trial.
Marshall Mohr: Clinical trial, what I was referring to was SP we had planned on doing a – we believe we have to do a clinical trial to get the next indication which is colorectal. Doing a clinical trial at this point in time is probably not going to happen right away. Having said that, I don’t think we had plans to do it right away. We had several steps we had to go through before we got there so I say, it’s delayed. It could be delayed and don’t know exactly when it will get done.
Gary Guthart: Calvin, you had more to add?
Calvin Darling: Yes, on the Ion side as well, data capture for the Ion PRECISE study we’ve talked about on these calls is currently delayed. We believe that positive clinical data will be an important catalyst for broader usage of the platform, but given the lack of visibility, we’re not in a position to provide a definitive revised timeline but it’s unlikely that the PRECISE study will readout this year. But you look at the new platforms, both Ion and SP are both in the measured rollout phases of market introduction and early stage utilization rates for both platforms has been encouraging. Ion commercial procedure rates were up over 110% from Q4 of 2019 to Q1 of 2020. SP procedure rates grew 14% from the fourth quarter and they’re up about 190% year-over-year. So really encouraging in these early phases, and Korea specifically where we have a broad clearance for SP, the utilization per system is at this point in time higher than it is for Xi.
Bob Hopkins: Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Thanks Bob.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I am wondering if you could just talk a little bit about procedure mix, the types of procedures that may come back a little bit faster versus others presumably low score prostate cases may lag and non-emerging hernias may lag, but I am just curious even based on your experience in China in terms of the procedure that came back a little bit faster, if you could comment on that at all?
Gary Guthart: Sure. Just as a broad brush, clearly, high-risk cancers are things delayed at real risk to patients and emergent or inflamed benign disease likewise. One caution, each country has a little bit different mix of procedures going into 2020 prior to COVID becoming a bigger issue. So the mixes are a little bit different. Calvin, why don’t you speak a little bit to what we have seen to-date?
Calvin Darling: Yes. And then again, procedures, it’s really they are following a continuum of urgency that are applied situationally. And like you say, clearly, the aggressive cancers require treatment and are delayed of significant risk to patients and likewise some benign conditions require timely intervention as well. We are working toward with customers to best understand the segments and we will elaborate further as the things progress. I mentioned in the prepared comments at least in the ending parts of the first quarter the more impacted procedures were things like hernia repair, benign gynecology and bariatrics with lesser impacts on things like thoracic procedures and colorectal procedures.
Gary Guthart: On my just personal channel checks, hospitals are now creating large backlogs of patients who are going to need surgery and there is – I am encouraged about their commitment to da Vinci as they go through that. So I think at some point the logistics of availability of PPE and other resources will start to free up a little bit and as they have time then they will have to attend to that group of patients and we will be there to support.
Tycho Peterson: And then maybe a follow-up on the capital comments, I appreciate the nature and the time of discussions may shift more toward alternative financing, but can you just talk maybe to the degree to which hospitals are actually engaging in capital discussions at this point as opposed to still dealing with COVID work and also curious to hear your thoughts on Europe just given capital outlook there? Thank you.
Marshall Mohr: Like I said in our prepared remarks, capital demand, we saw deferral of purchase decisions at the end of the quarter. I would expect that to continue. I would expect also that hospitals as COVID as they are able to dedicate resources to the procedures that maybe in backlog that they will use up existing capacity and therefore it won’t immediately result in capital demand. We still have conversations with some of the hospitals on capital. It’s just not possible to predict exactly where it’s going to come out for the quarter.
Gary Guthart: With regard to Europe, any color you want to give, Marshall?
Marshall Mohr: Europe, we didn’t see quite the same level of reduction in terms of procedures at the end of the quarter. That doesn’t mean to say that it will sustain itself. It’s possible that as the virus spreads that there could be additional pressures on procedures. And having said that, capital as you know we did 25 systems this quarter and what I reported in my prepared remarks, that’s far lower than what we had anticipated for the quarter. And so we are still – we are seeing the same kinds of interactions with customers in Europe as we are in U.S.
Gary Guthart: Tycho, you have heard us say this before and it’s really true in the data this quarter as well. Europe doesn’t act as one. So what’s happening in Italy feels and looks different than in Germany from our perspective, from France and from the UK. So, each will progress a little bit – on a little bit different pathway.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Tycho.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. One on procedures, one on – just on systems, on procedures, I appreciate the numbers, the percentages you provided us. I think those were exit rates from March and the slides look like those percentages continue to go down. So I apologize if I missed this, but would you be willing to provide any color on what you’ve seen in the first couple of weeks here in April, just to give us a better sense to how to think about Q2? And I did have one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Not ready to publish what’s happened thus far in April. I don’t think it’s shockingly different from what the beginnings of what you’re seeing in the charts we’ve given you there. But I’d also say that I don’t think the next two weeks are particularly predictive of anything. I think this will flow globally here over the next weeks and months and we’re really focused on how to make sure that we’re supporting our customers well and flow out of it.
Larry Biegelsen: And, Gary, thinking ahead, hospitals are going to be faced with two challenges. I think one is capacity constraints to handle postponed procedures. And second, moving procedures to alternative sites that I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks like ASCs potentially to isolate non-COVID patients or vice versa. What can you do to help hospitals with these two challenges? Thanks for taking the questions.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Appreciate it. Well a couple of things. We are well-represented in outpatient departments in hospitals already. We are absolutely able and willing to move systems to locations of care wherever they might be. We do have experience with systems in ASCs to the extent people want to move into ASC environments. We worked fine in those environments. We will be working on getting training and other resources geographically positioned where we think that folks can need additional support as they start to ramp up, recognizing that we don’t think a lot of people will be jumping on planes in phase 2 so we can sort of forward deploy our resources to help people as they get ready. And lastly, it’s staying in touch with our customers and surgery departments and making sure that we have inventory forward deployed for them for the kind of procedures they want to do.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the questions.
Gary Guthart: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Hi. Good afternoon. Hi, Gary. Hi, Marshall. A couple of things. Maybe let’s start with thinking about the slowdown in capital you have talked about and obviously related procedure declines. I know I’m looking ahead, far ahead, and you’re not comfortable really predicting the next quarter, but I just want to think about the recovery. Gary, how do we think about let’s say if the slowdown in capital persists throughout 2020 or well into 2020, does that suggest that 2020 recovery won’t be back to let’s say 2019 levels and it’s going to – it would take probably possibly until 2022 for us to see you get back at sort of a historical growth because of that slowdown in capital which might be slower to recover and therefore procedures slower to accelerate overall if you follow what I’m trying to get at?
Gary Guthart: I think the way I’d have you think about it is from the point of view of demand for surgery, demand for robotic assisted surgery, in that setting I think the world is queuing up a set of patients who will need care. Makes sense. I understand it. I think conserving of PPE and ICU’s and other valuable resources at this time makes sense. As some of those constraints start to loosen, I think everybody will have to adjust and adapt to caring for patients who have other conditions. That is the demand that will drive everything behind it, from INA and other inventory, to access to capital and systems. We’re well-positioned from an inventory point of view. We are well-positioned operationally and financially to move systems where they need to go, to put systems out on lease for usage-based models or other things to support customers the way they want to be supported and we’ll be quite agile. So, on the capital side, you may see shifts in the way capital is deployed and the way that we’re compensated for that capital relative to prior quarters, sort of historical norms. But we’ll be leaning forward to help people when they need that help. How fast that happens, I think that has a lot to do with government policy and health system policy as to when they pivot to go treat other patients. That will determine everything else.
Rick Wise: Got it. And just sort of a separate but related question, Gary, several of our ongoing physician conversations suggested that as things recover, actually robotic capacity won’t be sufficient to meet demand, which is an interesting thought and they suggested actually that on a recovery robotic surgery will lose market share so to speak of some of those deferred patients to laparoscopic surgery, to open surgery. I have no idea I would be curious to know if you have any high level thoughts about that, those physician comments? Thank you so much.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Thanks, Rick. It’s possible. I think that folks rotating into open surgery, patients who are great candidates for MIS is doing that set of patients a disservice. So we will see. That may happen, hard for us to control. With regard to capacity for robotics, remember, there are a lot of robots out there and they are right now underutilized. As that flows back, we can help. Will some folks want to use lap? Maybe. From the point of view of surgeon preference, surgeon comfort what their choices are, just remember surgeons are intentional about the method of surgery they choose. They don’t accidentally fall into robotic surgery training. They make those commitments and time investments for a reason and they have a preference. So, if we can fulfill their preference, great. That will be great. If we are unable to do so and they choose lap, because they couldn’t get access where they wanted, well, that may happen, but that’s really I think Intuitive’s job to make those systems available to them if they would like to use them.
Rick Wise: Thanks so much.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Larry Keusch, Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Larry Keusch: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess, Gary to start with just curious thinking about R&D, what changes are you making to allow the innovation engine to not stall out here? I am just curious how you are accomplishing that and what sort of processes, procedures you are putting in place?
Gary Guthart: Thank you. First thing has been to employ – to ensure, to protect the safety of our staff and those who supply us while we do our R&D. So step one has been to stay up-to-date on the latest employee work safety methods. We started our incident response team relatively early. We were up and running at full speed in terms of our incident response team in early January and so they start looking at best practice relaying out our onsite facilities as they need to be relayed out, enabling work from home where we can. We were pretty capable at remote work capabilities just given the distributed nature of our campuses. So, it’s really flexing in that regard. And then we have put in place a robust process for allowing onsite work where we think it can’t be done otherwise for training our staff and staying with it. And so we have done that. Of course, there is a loss of efficiency as you go through this and so there is no doubt that in the first weeks of this you start to slow down and then we are fighting hard to recover. Team attitudes have been fantastic. The agility and creativity of teams to get their work done, their willingness and desire to do so, has been really encouraging, so, so far, so good. Some things will go slower. To the extent that we have clinical trials out there and those are being conducted in hospitals that are being impacted by COVID, those things will slow down. The principal investigators in those places are highly committed first to patient care and then as a second priority to doing the research they would like to do and so that will come back as time permits for them to do so.
Larry Keusch: Okay, terrific. And then I guess the other question is you guys are obviously having a lot of conversations with surgeons, with hospitals. I am just sort of curious if you can comment on what you are hearing relative to maybe some of the bigger geographies in Europe or in the U.S. when they maybe able to start to get some of these surgeries going? As you guys have indicated multiple times on this call, there is a continuum and there are procedures that can be deferred, but not for potentially long periods of time. So I am just curious, I know it’s a fluid situation, but just anything you might be hearing as to when this might start to start up again?
Gary Guthart: Clearly, varies by country and is the reason that we put a couple of those charts on our website for you to look at is just to see the difference in how different countries are doing it. The places that are able to engage earliest have taken strategies where they have put COVID Care in one location and allowed surgery to occur in a different location or hot and cold zones within their own institutions that have allowed them to manage both concurrently so long as they have staff and PPE to do it. Giving you a general answer is really not possible at this time because of the puts and takes by region. What I will say is surgeons are there for a reason. They are – it’s impressive. They are both community-oriented and clearly understanding the need to support their communities as they flex into this crisis. At the same time, they are surgeons and they are looking forward to going back to surgery. The backlogs that you hear about are significant and they are concerned about those patients who are surgical patients who need care. The last comment I would make is that very few of the procedures that are done using robotic-assisted surgery are easily resolved by non-surgical means. We are in a part of surgery that where surgery is by and large the first choice. And as a result, I don’t think a lot of these procedures are going to dissolve in time just by waiting. I think they are going to have to be done surgically. So really will be a question of where do they get done, when do they get done and what kind of technology is used to do it.
Larry Keusch: Okay, great. Appreciate the thoughts.
Gary Guthart: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Thanks. Hey, good afternoon. Just a quick follow-up on the European system side, just thinking about operating leases out there and how that situation might evolve, can you just kind of maybe remind us of the tendency of certain countries to adopt via leases out there and whether you are sensing any kind of a change or improvement in that outlook as we think about them being more constrained to spend on capital potentially over the next year or so?
Gary Guthart: Marshall?
Marshall Mohr: Yes, there were – there are limitations as to what you can do within each European country. All of them have different rules as to registration and with different regulators around financing. Having said that, we really had launched leasing in Germany and the UK, a year, two years ago or so and France a little bit after that and we did see a nice uptick in leasing, particularly in Germany. I think going forward you will see leasing in all those markets. We are prepared to be able to offer it. We now understand structures we can do and what the requirements are from a reporting perspective and I think we are set. So I would anticipate given the impact of the COVID-19 that we would see additional leasing there.
Amit Hazan: And then just one quick kind of bigger question, bigger picture, longer term one for Gary, it’s early days, but how are you thinking if at all about secular changes for hospital systems and healthcare more broadly after this crisis is over as it kind of relates to your markets?
Gary Guthart: Okay, I think it’s a little too soon to tell. We certainly are thinking about how customers might adapt and you can think about a few things. I guess I would focus you on really kind of Phase 2 and Phase 3 of this coronavirus response. The economy starts opening back up and we have a fair amount of testing, but you are still dealing with COVID as an uncured disease. How do hospitals manage that? I think that’s a lot of where our thoughts are now that may have to do with site of care and other kind of flexible ways. We think minimally invasive surgery broadly and robotic-assisted surgery is important in that setting. Keeping people out of the hospital, allowing them to recover quickly at home, these are things that I think are generally good for the health care system and there may be some adaptation by health systems to be flexible about how to deliver that and we are working through that internally and with them and it gets exciting. What happens after that as this goes on a couple of years, I think we will all have to wait and see. Last questioner, please?
Operator: Yes. That will come from Matt Taylor, UBS. Please go ahead.
Matt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on some of the things you were talking about qualitatively earlier in regards to helping systems when they get back to working normally and helping them be efficient and flex up on the upside. I know you’ve done some work there with your internal consulting groups to make systems more efficient. Seems to be working and I was just wondering if you could offer some thoughts on how much more they could flex up in the short run? What are some of the best practices and what are the best systems doing with regards to utilization today?
Gary Guthart: Yes, if you think forward, the major things here have been really making sure that teams are consistent, teams that know how to work together, work together frequently, they know how to parallelize tasks and they use kind of best practices. It is not limited to robotic surgery but works really well therein. With regard to how we can help, making sure that training resources are available, we have been investing as in Intuitive Telemedicine Network. I’m really pleased that we made that set of investments and in the future that allows us to project expertise in at a distance, that means people don’t have to be on planes in a post-COVID world, that’s probably helpful for us and something that we want to rotate towards as we go. As I said earlier in the call, I think we can forward deploy some of our training resources and help get teams up and running and trained that would help people work through backlogs as best as they can.
Matt Taylor: Great. Thank you very much.
Gary Guthart: Alright. Well, thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there’s a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. During this period, our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams to support them in their mission wherever that may lead. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support. We look forward to talking with you again in three months. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for using AT&T event conferencing. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-23 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you standing by, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical’s Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Release. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive’s fourth quarter earnings call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2019 and 10-Q filed on October 18, 2019. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC’s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today’s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results, then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights and provide our financial outlook for 2020. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. At Intuitive, we measure our efforts by their ability to positively impact the quadruple aim; better outcomes, better patient experience, better care team experience, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. This fourth quarter of 2019 was another strong one for Intuitive in pursuit of these aims, capping a good year for the company. Our performance is reflected in healthy total growth and customer use of our systems, new capital installations, sustained quality service of our customers, clinical publications and the launch of new products and services. For the quarter, global procedure growth was approximately 19%. Growth was led by general surgery in the United States, with positive contributions to the global growth rate from Japan, China, Germany and Korea. Globally, customer utilization of systems increased again in the quarter, indicating greater productivity per installed system. Leasing and alternative placement models have also helped our customers gain access to additional procedure capacity with lower capital outlays. In the United States, year-over-year procedure growth for the quarter was 18%. General surgery accounted for the largest increase accompanied by stable growth in urology and gynecology. Within general surgery, hernia repair, cholecystectomy, bariatric and colorectal surgery showed strength. Outside the United States, several markets are early in their transition from growth in urology to other surgical categories, including gynecology, thoracic surgery and general surgery, with growth varying by country. Calvin will take you through global procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call. With regard to our installed base, placement of new systems in the quarter was solid. We placed 336 systems in the quarter, with growth in total placements rising 16% from Q4 of 2018. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci installed base grew to approximately 5,582. The mix of system placements this quarter continues to favor our flagship Xi system and trade-ins were healthy. The proportion of systems placed under operating leases was 38% this quarter, compared with 33% last quarter. As a reminder, total placements and the percentage of systems placed under lease or usage-based arrangements can vary substantially quarter-to-quarter. Over the past several years, we’ve been working to enable greater access to our products and services. For example, we believe leasing and usage-based models benefit our customers by lowering barriers for them to provide high-quality computer-aided interventions. We anticipate continuing to expand access and lower cost for our customers as our business progresses into different procedures and geographies. Turning to expenses. We believe we are still in the early days of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions. As a result, we’re investing in building our capability in several important ways, including deepening internationally, launching our new platforms, strengthening our computational capabilities, and executing projects that support future scale and provide leverage opportunities as we grow. Our spending for the quarter and for the year was within the upper-end of spend guidance we shared with you in 2019. It is supported by solid procedure growth, capital placements and product cost reductions. Financial highlights of our fourth quarter results are as follows: Procedures grew approximately 19% over the fourth quarter last year. We placed 336 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 290 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our installed base grew 12% from a year ago. Revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, up 22%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 72.2%, compared to 71.8% in the fourth quarter last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $671 million, up 24%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $896 million, growing 24% over Q4 of 2018 and representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $506 million in the quarter, up 23% from the fourth quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $417 million, up 18%. Highlights for the full-year of 2019 are as follows. Procedures grew approximately 18% over 2018; we placed 1,119 systems in the year, growing the installed base 12% over 2018; revenue for the year was approximately $4.5 billion, growing 20% over 2018; and pro forma net income was approximately $1.5 billion, up 17% over 2018. Turning to progress in our innovation pipeline, I’ll start first with systems. We’re in our Phase 1 launch of da Vinci SP and we are working to expand its clinical clearances and build SP products at scale. In the quarter, we installed six systems to bring our installed base of SP to 244. Customer response and early clinical results using SP remain encouraging, with over 50 peer-reviewed clinical articles on SP to date. With regard to additional indications for SP, we’ve been in discussion with FDA regarding data requirements for a colorectal indication. We expect this to require an IDE trial that includes follow-up analysis. This implies, we do not expect the third indication for SP in the U.S. in 2020. While I would like a faster launch of SP, the combination of additional indications for SP and our readiness for deployment at larger scale, will pace the speed of our SP commercial expansion. In flexible diagnostics, our Ion platform is focused on the need for accurate and timely biopsies to support definitive early diagnosis of suspicious lesions. As of the end of the quarter, there are approximately 16 systems in the field, some commercial and some clinical trial sites with several hundred procedures performed. To date, the roll out is meeting our expectations and user feedback during this initial launch period has been strong. We expect several publications reviewing the performance of Ion to be presented during 2020. Turning to instruments and accessories. Our team has been making great progress in building out our instrument portfolio with high-quality products. Our experience has shown that procedure adoption occurs when holistic – when the holistic needs of the care team are met, when the right system and imaging products come together with the right instruments and accessories. Our team initiated our first phase launch in the quarter for our SynchroSeal sealing and transection device, along with our first integrated energy controller called E-100. SynchroSeal seal provide surgeons with wristed precise and fast sealing and transection ability often used in general surgery. Early feedback on its performance has been outstanding. SynchroSeal seal joins our portfolio of advanced instruments, stapling instruments and advanced energy instruments that customers are now adopting in their da Vinci cases. Turning to imaging and analytics. We’re working on imaging, computing and real-time cloud techniques that allowed for capabilities from big data analytics to telementoring to augmented reality. Here alone, Intuitive Surgical simulators have been used for over 17,000 hours by more than 5,800 surgeons. Our IRIS augmented reality system entered clinical use in the fourth quarter of 2019, and we’re pleased with our first customer responses. Over the past several years, our analytical capability has increased, and we now routinely engage our customers to help assess the performance of their robotic-assisted surgery programs relative to other surgical modalities. Armed with local comparative analysis of robotic-assisted surgery within their institutions, hospitals with active programs have been building access to da Vinci systems in growing their programs. We expect continued investment and progress in these areas in 2020. As we move into 2020, let’s step back and review the da Vinci surgery universe. In the past several years, general surgeons have increased their adoption of our offerings, underpinned by improvements in the quadruple aim and procedures they perform from hernia repair, cholecystectomy and colorectal surgery to bariatric surgery. These surgical procedures span a broad range of complexity and economics. At the same time, Intuitive continues to deepen our capability in key countries to support the adoption of robotic-assisted surgery in their healthcare environments. We are flexing our company to better serve these customers, with the launch of new systems, new instruments and updates to our software, along with changes to our sales and support models and pricing structures. Given the large global opportunity to pursue the quadruple aim, I believe the next few years for the company will be dynamic. We will guide the company to meet our customers’ clinical and economic needs across this wide range of procedures and geographies. Doing so will involve continued investment in innovation in both technology and business models, and we see a path to do both. Moving into 2020, we are focused on the following First, supporting adoption of da Vinci in general surgery, including hernia repair, colorectal procedures and bariatrics; second, launching our SP Ion imaging instruments and analytics platforms; third, extending our depth in OUS markets, particularly Asia and EU with growth beyond urology; and finally, supporting additional clinical and economic validation in our focused procedures and countries. Lastly, we are pleased to publish today our inaugural quarter sustainability report, which you can find on our website, outlining our multi-year efforts in these areas. I’ll now turn the call over to Marshall, who’ll review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I would describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Revenue and procedures are consistent with our preliminary press release of January 9. Key business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows. Fourth quarter 2019 procedures increased approximately 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and increased approximately 11% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. Fourth quarter system placements of 336 systems increased 16%, compared with 290 systems last year, and increased 22%, compared with 275 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems by 12% to approximately 5,582 systems. This growth rate compares with 12% in the last quarter and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system grew approximately 6%, which is the same as the 6% growth last quarter and last year. Our revenue overview is as follows. Fourth quarter 2019 revenue was $1.3 billion, an increase of 22%, compared with $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 13%, compared with $1.1 billion last quarter. Instrument and accessory revenue of $671 million increased 24% compared with last year, which is higher than procedure growth, primarily reflecting customer buying patterns and increased usage of our advanced instruments. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,980, an increase of 5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and was consistent with last quarter. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure has grown in the low single digits over the past couple of years, reflecting increased usage of our advanced instruments, partially offset by higher growth and benign procedures, where revenue per procedure is lower than the overall average. While adoption of benign procedures has been a major contributor to the overall I&A revenue, to the extent, benign procedures grow faster than complex procedures, I&A per procedure may decline. In addition, over time, as we achieve greater penetration of our advanced instruments in da Vinci procedures, the growth rate for advanced instruments will slow and align with the growth rate of underlying procedures in which advanced instruments are used. Systems revenue for the fourth quarter 2019 was $416 million, an increase of 22% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, and an increase of 23% compared with last quarter. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2018, systems revenue reflected higher system placements, higher ASPs and higher lease-related revenue. We completed 126 operating lease transactions, representing 38% of total placements, compared with 84% or 29% of total placements in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 92% or 33% of total placements last quarter. As of December 31, we have 658 operating leases outstanding and realized approximately $34 million from revenues related to these arrangements in the quarter, compared with $16 million last year and $27 million last quarter. Operating leases create a future source of recurring revenue and reduce the volatility of system revenue, while the increased number of operating systems, operating leases placed in the quarter dampens short-term revenue growth for the quarter in which they are placed. Operating leases include usage-based financings that we provided to certain hospitals with advanced robotics experience. We believe that our lease financing alternatives align with customer objectives and have enabled faster market adoption. Relative to systems purchased over the lease period, we earn a small premium, reflecting the time value of money. And in the case of usage-based arrangements, the risks that those systems may not achieve anticipated usage levels. The proportion of operating lease and usage-based arrangements will likely increase long-term and will vary quarter-to-quarter. We recognize $34 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter, compared with $20 million last quarter and $17 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. 138 or 41% of current quarter system placements involved trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on our fourth generation technology, contributing to an Xi installed base growth of 39% year-over-year. This is an increase compared with 81 or 28% of system placements in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 116 or 42% last quarter. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and can be difficult to predict. However, given prior product trade-in cycles, we expect the proportion of the installed base traded in in future quarters to decrease over time. 81% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 16% were da Vinci X systems, compared with 79% da Vinci Xis and 17% da Vinci Xs last quarter. Six of the systems placed in the quarter – fourth quarter were SP systems. Our roll out of SP Surgical System will continue to be measured, putting systems in a hand of experienced da Vinci users, while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. We placed seven Ion systems in the quarter. Ion system placements are excluded from our overall systems count and will be reported separately. Procedures and other information associated with Ion are excluded from our prepared remarks and will be reported separately when it become more substantive. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating lease revenue and lease buyout was approximately $1.61 million, compared with $1.46 million last year and $1.57 million last quarter. Our fourth quarter ASPs reflect a favorable geographic mix, as we sold 39 systems into China and 26 into Japan, where ASPs are higher, given the higher cost of doing business in those geographies. Excluding geographic mix, ASPs for the quarter declined slightly relative to the third quarter, reflecting pricing arrangements associated with a higher mix of multisystem contracts. System ASPs will fluctuate with geographic consistent mix and may decline relative to the average total 2019 ASP, reflecting increased multisystem arrangements. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. OUS procedures grew approximately 22% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and increased 9% compared with last quarter. Fourth quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $422 million, increased 37% compared with fourth quarter of 2018 and increased 27% compared with last quarter. The increase compared with the prior year reflects increased instruments and accessories revenue of $47 million, or 39% growth and increased systems revenue of $58 million, or 42% growth. The increase in instrument and accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth and stocking orders associated with China system sales. The increase in systems revenue is primarily the result of increased placements and increased ASPs, reflecting favorable geographic and product mix. Outside of the U.S., we placed 140 systems in the fourth quarter, compared with 115 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 90 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe, 26 into Japan and 39 into China, compared with 55 into Europe, 31 into Japan and two into China in the fourth quarter of 2018. 71% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 24% were da Vinci X systems, compared with 55% da Vinci Xis and 30% da Vinci Xs last year. 32 of the system placements in the current quarter were operating leases, compared with 15 last year and 21 last quarter. The 39 systems into China included customers who had begun their tender processes and we believe expedited their purchase cycles to avoid a tariff increase that was expected on December 15. The proposed tariff was suspended on December 13. We would expect remaining purchases under the quarter to be completed consistent with historical timelines. And therefore, we expect placement – placements to be lower in the first quarter and skew more towards the end of 2020 and into 2021. While overall European system placements were relatively flat in the quarter and for 2019, shipments by country fluctuate significantly. Placements into the four largest European markets increased 29% in the fourth quarter and 19% for the year. Overall, placements outside of the U.S. will continue to vary as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption; some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns; and sales into some markets are constrained by government limitations. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 72.2%, compared with 71.8% for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 72% last quarter. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and last quarter, primarily reflects higher system ASPs and product cost reductions. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency. Pro forma operating expenses increased 23% compared with the fourth quarter 2018 and increased 19% compared with last quarter. Spending is consistent with their plan and includes an order of magnitude of increase, costs associated with expansion of our OUS markets, spending on our imaging and analytics capabilities and investment in our infrastructure in order to scale the business. We believe we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world and have been and will continue to invest in the business accordingly. Our pro forma tax rate for the quarter was 21.1%, compared with our expectations of 19% to 20%, reflecting geographic mix. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our fourth quarter 2019 pro forma net income was $417 million, or $3.48 per share, compared with $353 million, or $2.96 per share for the fourth quarter 2018 and $409 million, or $3.43 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $358 million, or $2.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with GAAP net income of $293 million, or $2.45 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 and GAAP net income of $397 million, or $3.33 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.8 billion, compared with $5.4 billion at September 30, 2019. The cash generated from operations was partially offset by investments in working capital and infrastructure during the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter and year are higher than historical averages as we invest in our infrastructure. We expect investments in our infrastructure to continue into 2020. In the quarter, we grew inventory by approximately $16 million to $596 million, representing approximately 142 days of inventory, which is slightly lower than at the end of the third quarter. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and have approximately $1.7 billion remaining under the Board buyback authorization. In summary, I want to highlight certain business dynamics that may impact your models. First, as I noted, we will grow operating expenses appropriately, as we see the substantial opportunity to expand the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions. Calvin will provide you with operating expense growth guidance. In addition, as we align to our – with our customer needs, we believe the percentage of leasing and alternative financing arrangements will increase over time. We also believe the number of trade-in transactions will level off in the short-term and then decline over time. System ASPs will fluctuate with geographic and system mix and may decline relative to the average total 2019 ASP, reflecting increased multisystem arrangements. While adoption of benign procedures has been a major contributor to overall I&A revenue, to the extent, benign procedures grow faster than complex procedures, the I&A per procedure may decline. Lastly, it’s likely we will see elongated negotiation timelines and possibly price pressures as competition gets closer to launching their products. We will continue doing to manage the business for the long-term, as we believe that the fundamentals of the business are strong. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Calvin, who go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2020.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was approximately 19%, compared to 19% during the fourth quarter of 2018 and nearly 20% last quarter. Our Q4 procedure growth was driven by 18% growth in U.S. procedures and 22% growth in OUS markets. Overall, procedure growth for the full-year 2019 was approximately 18%, equal to 18% of 2018, comprised of 17% growth in the U.S. and 21% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., Q4 procedure growth was consistent with recent trends and was largely driven by continued strength in general surgery, with substantive contributions from gynecologic and urologic procedures. In U.S. general surgery, fourth quarter growth and leading procedures, hernia repair and colorectal remain solid at rates consistent with last quarter. Cholecystectomy growth continued to accelerate in the fourth quarter and now represents a significant driver of incremental procedures. While da Vinci cholecystectomy adoption has been robust, given the high-level of lab penetration, it is difficult for us to predict the extent and pace of future chole adoption. Bariatric procedures also showed continued solid growth in Q4 and will become an increasing area of field focus for us in 2020. For the full-year 2019, approximately 421,000 U.S. general surgery procedures were performed, up 29% from 2018, representing approximately 48% of overall U.S. da Vinci procedures. Q4 U.S. gynecology procedure growth was largely consistent with the first three quarters of 2019. For the full-year 2019, approximately 282,000 U.S. gynecologic surgery procedures were performed, up 6% from 2018, representing approximately 32% of overall U.S. procedures. In U.S. urology, fourth quarter dVP growth rates continue to exceed our expectations, although growth did moderate from Q3. For the full-year 2019, approximately 138,000 U.S. urologic procedures were performed, up just under 10% from 2018, representing approximately 16% of overall us da Vinci procedures. As a highly penetrated procedure category, we believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes should track to the broader prostate surgery market and will likely grow more modestly in 2020. Fourth quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 22%, compared with 24% for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 23% last quarter. Fourth quarter 2019 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in urology procedures and earlier stage growth in general, gynecologic and thoracic surgery. In China, as in Q3, procedure growth accelerated modestly, as new systems installed under the latest system quota began to provide capacity for incremental growth. In Q4, the China procedure growth rate slightly exceeded the overall OUS metric. As Marshall mentioned, 39 systems were shipped into China in Q4. Note that 35 of these 39 systems went to new hospitals. Teams in these hospitals will need to move through training pathways and establish da Vinci procedure processes before these new systems contribute meaningfully to procedure growth in China. In Japan, procedure growth was again strong at just over 40%, reflecting growth in procedures granted reimbursement status in April 2018 and continued later-stage growth in urology procedures. Our emphasis in Japan remains on surgeon and team training and building proctoring networks. Overall, European procedure growth was largely consistent with prior periods with variation by country. German results were particularly strong, while results in the UK lag. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. A recent article by Drs. Wexner and Emile et al in the Journal of Techniques in Coloproctology provided results from a systemic review and meta analysis of intracorporeal versus extracorporeal anastomosis in minimally invasive Right Colectomy. This study analyzed data from 25 studies and 4,450 patients. Intracorporeal anastomosis was associated with significantly shorter length extraction site incisions, earlier bowel recovery, fewer complications and lower rates of conversion anastomotic leaks, surgical site infections and incisional hernia, as compared to extracorporeal anastomosis. This study highlighted the many clinical outcome advantages associated with intracorporeal anastomosis. da Vinci systems, instruments and smart stapling technology enabling performing an anastomosis of the bowel inside the body. And it is our hope that more patients can benefit from intracorporeal anastomosis with continued adoption of our technology. Intuitive investment in a prospective multicenter intracorporeal versus extracorporeal anastomosis study comparing robotic versus laparoscopic approaches, called the ANCHOR study, is timely. And the enrollment for this study is expected to be completed this year, with results expected in 2021. The details of the ANCHOR study are available online at clinicaltrials.gov. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2020. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement earlier this month, total 2019 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 18% to roughly 1,229,000 procedures performed worldwide. As communicated previously, during 2020, we anticipate full-year procedure growth within a range of 13% to 16%. We expect 2020 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside the United States, where we’re at earlier stages of adoption. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2019, as we have experienced in previous years, with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. Q1 and full-year 2020 will benefit from one extra working day attributable to leap year. With respect to revenue. As we have mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure demand, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales can vary substantially from period-to-period based upon many factors, including U.S. healthcare policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Within this framework, we’d expect 2020 capital placements seasonality to generally follow historical patterns by quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2019, 126 of the 336 systems shift or 38% were under operating leases. We expect the proportion of systems placed to be operating leases will vary from quarter-to-quarter and could trend up in the future. During Q3 and Q4, 42% and 41%, respectively, of systems placements were upgrades to our Gen 4 platform. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect the proportion of trade-in transactions to generally trend downwards in 2020. Turning to gross profit. Our full-year 2019 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.7%. In 2020, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. The slightly lower gross profit margin anticipated in 2020 reflects higher sales of newer products and infrastructure investments. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. Turnings to operating expenses. In 2019, our pro forma operating expenses grew 27%. In 2020, we expect pro forma operating expenses to grow between 15% and 20%. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $400 million and $440 million in 2020, compared to $336 million in 2019. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $100 million and $115 million in 2020. With regard to income tax. In 2019, our pro forma income tax rate was 19.5%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2020 pro forma tax rate to be between 20% and 21% of pre-tax income, with the increase primarily reflecting the anticipated geographic mix of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis: Great. Good afternoon. Just two questions for me. Gary, I want to start with you first on chole. It’s probably your largest procedure set in terms of volume, two sequential quarters of acceleration within chole, obviously, still very low penetration. Historically, that was tied to sort of trainings, physicians would use chole as a way of training a broader general surgery procedures. But can you just talk about the last two quarters’ acceleration in procedure? Do you think that’s simply training, a leading indicator of general surgery, or do you think something is going on in distinct from that within broader chole? And a quick follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Okay. On the first one, just I’m going to put a posted note on the assumption of its size relative to everything else. I’ll let Calvin come back and put it in context size-wise in terms of current run rate. But the underlying question of what are we seeing in cholecystectomy? We think there’s a segment there, where we’re bringing differentiated clinical value could be underlying clinical elements like obesity, comorbidities, state of disease of the gallbladder. So while it’s a large category as a whole, generally well-served by minimally invasive surgery today. There are segments in it that are difficult and for which we think current product sets do really well. There’s also a set of training or people deepening their experience as they go through it. So there’s a mix of those two. We think there is a durable component segmenting out how big that is over time. We’re still working through, where we think those endpoints are. We have seen it both grow in the last few quarters and appear to be sticky, not to have be a transient. Calvin, in terms of kind of setting in context relative to other procedures.
Calvin Darling: No, I mean, the size of the market, you can tell from our commentary, it’s gotten to the point where general surgery is a meaningful enough category. It’s a more and more significant contributor to growth within the general surgery category that’s growing overall. Again, as we mentioned, the commentary, it’s hard for us to gauge given the high lab penetration there to what extent and what pace it may ultimately adopt.
David Lewis: Okay. And then just curious, second question for me is just on the capital environment. Your fourth quarter U.S. net placement growth was a little lower and Europe in 2019 was little lower on a net placement basis. Maybe just comment an underlying demand for systems in the U.S. and the European markets. And also curious if has, in any respect, has competitors introducing new systems or talking about their new systems more publicly? Has it in anyway impacted demand or changed the conversation you’re having with large IDNs in the U.S. or European customers? Thanks so much.
Gary Guthart: On the outline of the first question, you sort of think about what the installed base growth was. So if you think about capital demand underneath, there’s what’s happening to installed base. So opening additional capacity in various places or trade-ins of older generation systems. I’ll let Marshall speak to the quantitative nature of your question with regard to the U.S. and in Europe. But I’d say, there is something – there’s some trade-in dynamics that I think the team has been discussing with you the last couple of quarters. In general, I think, we’re feeling like it’s reasonably stable. On the second piece of what will competitive advertising and conversation do. From time-to-time, we see delay deals. We definitely see increasing conversations as they get closer to market with what they want to do or other companies are starting to get some clearances in other regions. In general, our teams have handled that pretty well. But I think the noise level will increase. I think that customers are interested in listening to other pitches. I think we’re pretty well-positioned to have a conversation about that. But I do see delay from time-to-time. It kind of comes in waves and then it’ll settle as the world figures out kind of what they’re offering. But Marshall, maybe a little bit on – a little more quantitative answer than that.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. First, the capital environment has been approximately the same. There haven’t been much in terms of change in motives and so forth over the last several quarters. The number of systems that we placed in the U.S., which is disclosed on the – in the web – website is what is healthy in our view. In fact, what you – the other way we measure honestly, how well we’re doing is the utilization of systems and utilization of systems growth, as I said, was 6%, which is consistent with where it’s been. And in Europe, we saw, as I said, maybe flattish number of systems place, both in the quarter as well as compared to the previous year in total. And just be aware of averages and it’s going to be lumpy. When you’re in earlier stages of adoption in less mature markets, you’re going to see a lumpiness to placements of capital. When we look at the four largest markets, we saw nice growth, which, again, as Calvin commented, procedure growth in Germany was strong, and we saw nice placements in Germany, for example. Does that help?
David Lewis: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I’ll start with SP. Just curious following your discussions with FDA, any color you can provide on just when the trial is going to start size and what’s expected for follow-up analysis? And then outside the U.S., you’re obviously generating data on SP and thoracic and OSA and Korea. Can just talk about some of the data generations outside the U.S. as well?
Gary Guthart: Sure. On the first one, I think, we’re settling in on what the trial will look like in and I’m not ready yet to answer that, but I think we’re getting close. So in future quarters, we should be able to answer that question. With regard to what we’re seeing elsewhere, we’re starting to see in terms of Korea, where we have more regulatory room and clinical indications. We’ll start seeing a whole series of publications coming out talking about where there’s opportunity. And it’s, I think going to be quite interesting and shows real potential for us. It’s the thing that drives our underlying commitment and excitement. I don’t have them at the tip of my fingers. I do know that in future quarters, we will start describing to you what the substance of some of these publications are as they start to release.
Tycho Peterson: And then just sticking with pipeline for a minute, can you just comment on IRIS, where we are in the roll out, it’s obviously early days? And then also if you could just comment separately on the Scholly Endoscope acquisition and have you worked the supply chain headwinds there?
Gary Guthart: Great. I’ll do so. IRIS, first couple of accounts up and running, we expect more this quarter. It’s really testing the whole order to delivery pipeline. Think of that as a digital pipeline that has to go through. Feedback is really encouraging. So this early part of – it’s one of these things that’s easy to describe, but to do well is hard, making sure all your cloud connections are right, making sure you have all your security protocols done, getting the turnaround times, right, getting your all your machine learning algorithms right. Feedback has been really good about its ability to help surgeons visualize pre-case, which is fantastic, using other kinds of ways in terms of patient consultation and then access during the case. So the kind of the core idea, I think, is being vetted nicely. We have said before, we don’t think it’s a significant revenue driver in 2020. I think I would encourage people to think about this as baseline core technology that kinds of things that as you develop systems like this in the future that customers will come to expect a little bit like our Firefly product. It is additive in the way that it – it’s – the system itself becomes greater than the sum of its parts. So IRIS, I think looks quite strong. On the Scholly acquisition, the team is doing a really nice job. We were right to bring it in. We were right bring it in when we did. That is doing a couple of things for us. It’s giving us a little more alignment around next gen products, which is exciting for us. It’s helping us double down on some investments in terms of capacity and efficiency that goes with that capacity. And it will, in the medium term, start releasing some profitability and financing with regard to the way we produce our endoscopes that can be turned around and reinvested in the business. So far so good. It is real work. They are in a very good team. I think we knew what we were bringing in and acquiring. I’m really pleased with the leadership of the group and our team members that have joined us in Germany and in Boston or in Massachusetts. It’s not to say there isn’t work to be done, but so far, so good.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then one last clarification from Marshall. You called out a china pull forward dynamic around the tariff. Can you just – in the context of the 39 systems, are you able to quantify how much of that was tied to the tariff?
Marshall Mohr: Well, not – I can’t quantify specifically. I would just tell you that there were a number of systems that the customers decided to expedite the process and we were the beneficiary of that obviously.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: All right. Our next question will come from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Robert Hopkins: Great. Thank you. Just first quick question on the I&A [Technical Difficulty] case, you highlighted some tailwind, potential headwinds that called out that revenue per pace could decline next year?
Gary Guthart: Hey, Bob, we’ve heard some – you got yourself broken, yes, kind of broken up on the call. So could you reask the question?
Robert Hopkins: Sorry about that. Just on instrument and accessory, I just want to make sure I hear the messaging, because there’s some positives and positives. I probably thought it could decline [Technical Difficulty] stapling. I just want to share the messaging on the I&A line for the next 12 months?
Gary Guthart: Yes. So what I said, Bob, was, we’ve really seen good contribution to I&A revenue overall from benign procedures. But as we’ve described before, the increase in the I&A per procedure is really a reflection of additional advanced instrument revenue and then a per procedure, offset by benign procedure growth. So all I’m calling out is if we’re successful in growing benign procedures much faster than complex procedures, then you will see – then it will win the tug-of-war and therefore, your I&A per procedure might decline. On the advanced instruments, we’ve enjoyed further penetration into the procedures in which advanced instruments are used. And as that has occurred, then our revenue associated with procedures, our revenue per procedure has grown disproportionately to the number of procedures. Over time, as you penetrate that, then you will revert to your advanced technology growth will be consistent with the number of additional procedures you add versus adding also incremental procedures that were previously not including it. So all we’re saying is that, there’s the potential that the growth rate will decline. We still expect growth just a lower rate.
Robert Hopkins: Okay, thank you. And then quick question on U.S. capital. Over the last couple of years, the growth in procedures per average system has been remarkably consistent at about 5%, especially in the U.S. Is there a reason in your view why that number might change meaningfully in 2020, or is that a – that trend line expected to continue?
Gary Guthart: No. I think, directionally, continued growth in procedures per system is something we would expect. It’s something that we’re actively working with customers, sharing analytics and data to help them to make their practices programs as efficient as they can be. So I think, the trend, I don’t know if it’s going to continue in exactly at the same rates, but increasing utilization is something we would expect.
Robert Hopkins: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Hopefully, you guys can hear me okay. Just one on Ion and then one on the P&L. How should we think about the ramp of Ion in 2020? Is it still going to be a controlled launch? Should we just expect a steady increase in placements? And I had one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: As we’ve said in our prepared remarks, Ion is in the early stages of a measured launch. And so you should expect that it will grow slowly over time.
Calvin Darling: And slowly through 2020 and…
Gary Guthart: Yes.
Calvin Darling: …and then more rapidly thereafter.
Larry Biegelsen: I got it. And gross margins came in better in 2019 versus your original guidance. What are the puts and takes on the gross margin in 2020? And separately, Gary, R&D as a percentage of sales has been increasing steadily. It’s almost 10% of sales in 2019. Where do you see that going over time? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.
Gary Guthart: Okay, sure. So for gross margins, the gives and takes are, as I outlined in my prepared remarks, pricing on systems, reductions in cost, manufacturing efficiency and mix, mix of both customers and types of product. And I think that what we’re messaging for next year is that, the gross margins will decline slightly, reflecting primarily product mix and a shift – the effect of new product and investments in the infrastructure.
Larry Biegelsen: And R&D, Marshall as a percent of sales? Maybe I’m just curious if you expect that to continue to increase? Sorry, Gary?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I know I can jump in and take that one. I think about – we haven’t grown R&D as a percentage of sales pretty consistently over the last three years. And our messaging to you has been, we’re going to bring a couple of new platforms to market in parallel with some of our multiport efforts SP and Ion being those two that we think that next gen imaging and non-optical imaging is important, non-white light imaging is important, and we’ve been investing in that domain. We have been investing for scale. We’ve talked about the fact that, I think, there’s a virtuous cycle here, which is, as utilization goes up and volumes go up, it allows us to start taking advantage of automation opportunities and changing the way we manufacture. That has taken the company to be a little more capital-intensive than in years past. But some of the things you were just talking about, the linkage to your prior question on gross margin are enabled by these capital investments on multi-year timelines that allow us to get production scale advantages. And that allows us to share some of that cost savings with our customer and be able to be into lower complexity procedures at good economics and good economics for the company, as well as the customer. So we’ve been doing that as well. And then lastly, it’s been building in digital infrastructure. So those are the major buckets that have been taking the R&D spend side. I think we are not thinking that number will leap going forward. But we also think we’re still in the early innings of a baseball game here that that have real opportunity long-term for growth of the market. And we think that we can position ourselves really well by making sure that those four buckets are adequately staffed. Marshall…
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the question.
Gary Guthart: Okay.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Good afternoon, Gary, everybody. You talked – Marshall mentioned it, I think, Calvin mentioned it that system trade-ins may slow, may trend down. I just want to make sure that I’m understanding the reasons why. Is it the lack of a major new next gen system launch? And so you’ve seen the trade-ins that quote, the easy trade-ins. And maybe just as part of that, Gary, just reflecting back on R&D and innovation, obviously, you’re launching a lot of new products and innovation. But should we be thinking that there you don’t need to launch next gen big Ion, or how do we think about that those two aspects of trade-ins and the pipeline?
Gary Guthart: So trade-ins, we’ve been in the middle of a fairly strong cycle of trade-ins and you’ve seen it go up quarter-over-quarter, last two quarters kind of flattening out. And what we commented on at the end of the third quarter, Rick, was that the total population of SIs that are out there that can be traded in obviously is decreasing as customers trade-in their systems. And so the population is decreasing. And when we look back at historical patterns for previous generation products, we think that we’re at the peak of how much of that remaining days will be traded in in any particular quarter. And so the two of those things lead us to the conclusion that you’ll see a decrease in the number of trade-ins as we go forward. The second-half of the question, I might quibble with the description is big Ion, so I’m not going to own that. But I will talk to innovation in multiport. We’re not done any innovating in multiport. We’re often asked, are you – I see SP, I see Ion, is that it? The answer is categorically no. We think there’s room for additional innovation beyond our gen 4 multiport products and we’re working on those things.
Rick Wise: All right. And just two other quick ones. I’d be curious to hear more about sales force productivity. You highlighted, Gary, the improved productivity in the third quarter, it seems like that’s part – has to be part of the equation, I’m guessing in the fourth quarter. How do we think about that factor as a driver in 2020? And I’ll just ask my second one. Your competitors are – or potential robotic competitors are talking about digital surgery, and we’ve talked about this before. But I just wonder if you have competitors marketing something called digital surgery, how do we imagine intuitive answering that kind of a functional or marketing push? Thank you so much.
Gary Guthart: Okay. On the first question, the sales force productivity, we saw a move in the right direction in the fourth quarter, some of the underlying dynamics in terms of rapid procedure growth or healthy procedure growth driving the need for new territories still exists. So I credit our sales leadership team is doing a really nice job, both managing growth and helping the organization become more productive while thinking through territory opportunities, as well as efficiency opportunities. That’s a long way of saying we made a step in the right direction. I think they have opportunity to keep moving in the right direction in terms of productivity. So far, so good. With regard to some of the commentary around digital surgery, I – the short answer is welcome to the party. I think that we’ve been working these issues for more than a decade. As I said before, my initial response is, it’s a valuable thing to be working on, and that’s why we’ve been doing it. We’ve been the Internet of Things in surgical robots for a decade, cloud-enabled for a decade. We are quite deep. As you go out and talk a little more than the tagline, you talk about what tag lines are, what’s the substance? So dig down a little bit and the substance comes down to, I think, four opportunities. One opportunity is in the use of big data for analytic power. And that says that, as you look across large sets of customers doing various things, can you help establish benchmarks that people can improve upon, and we have done that. It’s been something we’ve been working on. So I think we’re becoming quite skilled and will become more so. That’s one category. Another category is the use of computing power in real-time to aid the surgeon or interventionalist during a case to get a better outcome. And absolutely interesting. There are many, many companies in the world that are thinking about that and making progress and we are one of them. Ion is fundamentally powered by computing to help you make good decisions. IRIS is fundamentally a real-time computing capability in addition to big data. So that’s one. The next bucket is around education and the reduction of variation team to team. We know that care team variation in any acute intervention, be it surgery, robotic surgery, laparoscopy is highly variable. And the use of computing and analytics to help that process is clear. And I talked to you a little bit about how much we have in simulation 200,000 simulated tasks done by surgeons this last year, 17,000 hours of simulation capability. These are things that we can help turn into better learning environments and reduction in care team variation. And the last bucket is efficiency improvement. The use of computing technologies and networking to help hospitals become more productive and to help our company become more productive, and we’re leveraging those opportunities on both of our customers and otherwise. So I look forward to the conversation. I think it will win. The winner won’t be the tagline. I think the winner will be those who deliver real value that’s validated against those four categories.
Rick Wise: Thank you so much.
Gary Guthart: We’ll take one more question, operator.
Operator: Okay. That final question, one moment please. That final question will come from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones. The first, I’ll ask them both just right upfront. The first one, the comments on cholecystectomy as a training procedure and kind of what you’re seeing there as a spillover to, again, a couple of other general surgery. Are you seeing that same dynamic increase in the usage or the utilization within hernia as kind of a like a training ground for other types of general surgeries, or is hernia kind of also equally as sticky? And then the second question, just, Marshall, on the I&A per case, if the benign growth does accelerate relative to the advanced type cases, what’s the impact to gross margin there? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Well, I’ll take the first one. I’ll let Marshall take the second one. One thing I would just to be clear on general surgery is, general surgery is a quite a diverse set of procedures with quite a diverse set of practice patterns amongst general surgeon practitioners or practices. I – first of all, I think they choose procedures to do not simply to be trained, because – but because they think they and the patient can be benefited by that procedure. So I don’t think they run off and train for the sake of training, I think they decide that there’s some value here. They will sequence their way into a practice and that would make sense, both by patient selection and by the type of procedure they do. You would ask, does the same kind of effect of, well, let’s start with the right patient population for cholecystectomy also apply to something like hernia? The answer to that is yes. Some surgeons will elect to go into a hernia set first. Then if they find value in the product, find value in the process, they may elect to move from there to a different procedure. Interestingly, we found that there is not a one size fits all way that a practice adopts. They may choose a different entry point depending on their interests and experiences. Second question, Marshall?
Marshall Mohr: I&A per case, if benign procedures were to grow faster than more complex procedures, it’s a very slight improvement in gross margin. And the advanced instruments have just a slightly lower gross margin than our other instruments.
Gary Guthart: Okay, that was our last question. In closing, we’ll believe – we believe there’s a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes, better patient experiences, better experiences for care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost of care per patient episode. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and the environment in which they operate. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference. I want to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-17 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you standing by and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q3 2019 Earnings Release Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to Intuitive's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties.  These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2019 and 10-Q filed on July 22, 2019. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results, then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2019. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Intuitive has been enabling customers in their delivery of high-quality, minimally invasive surgery for 20 years, and we believe the adoption of robotics and computer-aided interventions is early relative to its long-term potential. We measure our efforts by their ability to positively impact the quadruple aim; better outcomes, better patient experience, better care team experience, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. This third quarter of 2019 was another solid one for Intuitive in pursuit of these aims. Our performance in the quarter is a reflection of our progress, with procedures and system placements showing continued strength. For the quarter, global procedure growth was nearly 20%, aided by an increase of approximately a surgery day relative to Q3 of 2018. Growth again centered on general surgery in the United States, with positive contributions to the global growth rate from Germany, Korea and Japan. China procedure growth continues to be limited by installed base growth. Total procedure growth in China is responding positively considering the release of system quota and subsequent placements. In the United States, year-over-year procedure growth for the quarter was 18%. General surgery again accounted for the largest increase year-over-year, accompanied by solid growth in urology and stable growth in gynecology. We also saw strength in bariatrics and cholecystectomy. Hernia repair and colon resection growth rates were solid in the quarter. Improvements in system utilization by customers and alternative capital placement models are having a positive impact on our business. Our US sales force productivity improved in the quarter as our new team members gained experience. Calvin will take you through global procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call. With regard to our installed base, placement of new systems in the quarter was solid, with growth in total placements rising 19% from Q3 of 2018. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci installed base grew 12% over Q3 2018 to approximately 5,406. The mix of system placements this quarter moved towards our flagship Xi system and trade-ins were healthy. The proportion of systems placed under operating leases was 33% this quarter compared with 32% last quarter. As a reminder, total placements and the percentage of systems placed under lease or usage-based arrangements can vary substantially quarter-to-quarter. Turning to expenses, we're investing in building our capability in international regions, launching new platforms, strengthening our computational capabilities, and executing projects that support future sale and provide leverage opportunities as we grow. Our spending is on track with our expectations. It is supported by solid procedure growth, capital placements, and product cost reductions. Financial highlights for our third quarter results were as follows. Procedures grew nearly 20% over the third quarter of last year. We placed 275 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 231 in the third quarter of 2018. Our installed base grew 12% from a year ago. Revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, up 23%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 72% compared to 71.5% in the third quarter last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $606 million, up 25%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $817 million, growing 24% over Q3 of 2018 and representing 72% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $462 million in the quarter, up 18% from the third quarter of last year. Pro forma net income was $409 million, up 21%, and we repurchased $70 million in shares at an average price of $493 per share. Turning to our investments in products, I'll start first with systems. We are in our phase 1 launch of da Vinci SP as we work to expand clinical clearances and build SP products at scale. In the quarter, we proactively held shipments on SP endoscopes and limited new system installations for a limited time as we investigated a robustness concern on the SP endoscope. We resumed shipping endoscopes and systems in the quarter. Given the slowdown on endoscopes, we installed four systems to bring our installed base with SP to 38. Customer response and early clinical results using SP remain encouraging. In addition, utilization rates for SP in Korea, where clinical indications are the broadest, are at Xi levels already, a testament to surgeons' engagement and our team's skill and design for usability. With regard to additional indications for SP, we have been in discussion with FDA regarding data requirements for a colorectal indication. We expect this to require an IDE trial that includes follow-up analysis. This implies we do not expect the third indication of SP in the US in 2020. While we had planned for a smoother launch of SP and product availability and new indications timelines, our teams are focused on building at scale and satisfying regulatory requirements for additional indications. Interest in SP is healthy and clinical outcomes are encouraging, forming the basis of our belief in the long-term potential of the platform to improve care. The combination of additional indications for SP and our readiness for deployment at larger scale pace the speed of our SP commercial expansion. In flexible diagnostics, our Ion platform is focused on need for accurate and timely biopsies to support definitive early diagnosis of suspicious lesions. Since our 510(k) clearance in Q1 of this year, we initiated our first phase launch focused on clinical use, customer feedback and production optimization. First cases on the cleared system were performed at the end of Q1. There are now nine systems in the field, performing cases with the total case experience in the hundreds. To date, the rollout is meeting our expectations with a mix of clinical trial sites and commercial sites. User feedback during this initial launch period has been strong. For instruments and accessories, our team moved to full United States launch of our 45-millimeter SureForm stapler and obtained clearance for it in Japan and Korea in the quarter. We also obtained 510(k) clearance for our new Curved-Tip SureForm 45-millimeter stapler and a new gray reload designed to staple thin structures. Recall that surgical stapling is a family of products that help surgeons in a range of procedures covering parts of the body from the rectum to the thoracic cavity. Robotically-held staplers are a sophisticated technology, and our team is doing an excellent job filling out the product portfolio. Our experience has shown that procedure adoption occurs when the holistic needs of the care team are met, when the right system and imaging products come together with the right instruments and accessories. Stapling is another example of this synergy, with surgeon adoption of generation four da Vinci Systems with SureForm staplers gaining momentum. Turning to imaging and analytics, we are working on computing and real-time cloud technologies that allow for tasks from telementoring to augmented reality. We now have over 20 active telementoring sites that together have supported hundreds of cloud-enabled, real-time surgery sessions as we progress in building our real-time cloud capabilities. Feedback on the utility of these sites for case observations and mentoring has been supportive. In augmented reality, we're working through logistics and installation of our first IRIS accounts to gather customer and clinical feedback. We expect first clinical cases on the IRIS system in the next few months. Lastly, our surgical simulation products have become widely adopted in the installed base with more than 3,200 da Vinci simulators in the field. Before turning the time over to Marshall, let's step back and consider Intuitive's evolution over the past few years. Over this period, general surgeons have increased their adoption of our offerings, underpinned by improvements in the quadruple aim and procedures they perform, from colon and rectal procedures, to hernia repair, cholecystectomy and bariatric surgery. General surgery procedures span a broad range of complexity and economics. At the same time, we've extended our reach into key countries to support the adoption of robotic-assisted surgery into their healthcare environments. We have flexed our company to better serve these customers, with the launch of new systems, new instruments and updates to our software, along with changes to our sales and support models and pricing structures. Given the large global opportunity to pursue the quadruple aim, we believe the next few years for the company will be dynamic. We will guide the company to meet our customers' clinical and economic needs across this wide range of procedures and geographies. Doing so will involve continued investment in innovation for both technology and economic models, and we see a path to do both. For the balance of the year, our focus remains in completing the task we set for ourselves. First, supporting adoption of da Vinci in general surgery and in key procedures in global markets. Second, launching our SP and Ion platforms. Third, driving intelligent surgery innovation. And finally, supporting additional clinical and economic validation in our focus procedures and countries. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights. 
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Key business metrics for the third quarter are as follows. Third quarter 2019 procedures increased nearly 20% compared with the third quarter of 2018, and increased approximately 2% compared with last quarter. There was one more operating day in the third quarter of 2019 compared with the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of the extra operating day, we would have been in line with our full year average growth. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the US and urology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. Third quarter system placements of 275 systems increased 19% compared with 231 systems last year and increased 1% compared with 273 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems by 12% to approximately 5,406 systems. The growth rate compares with 13% in both the last quarter and last year.  Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, grew approximately 6%, which is higher than the 4% growth last quarter and below the 7% growth last year. Our revenue overview is as follows. Third quarter 2019 revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of 23% compared with $921 million for the third quarter of 2018 and an increase of 3% compared with $1.1 billion last quarter.  Instrument and accessory revenue of $606 million increased 25% compared with last year, which is higher than procedure growth primarily reflecting customer buying patterns and increased usage of our advanced instruments.  Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,980, an increase of 4% compared with the third quarter of 2018 and an increase of 3% compared with last quarter.  Systems revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $339 million, an increase of 23% compared with the third quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 2% compared with last quarter. Relative to the third quarter of 2018, systems revenue reflected higher system placements, higher ASPs and higher lease-related revenue.  We completed 92 operating lease transactions, representing 33% of total placements compared with 58 or 25% of total placements in the third quarter of 2018, and 88 or 32% of total placements last quarter.  As of September 30, we have 560 operating leases outstanding and realized approximately $27 million of revenue related to these arrangements in the quarter compared with $14 million last year and $25 million last quarter.  Operating leases create a future source of recurring revenue and reduce the volatility of system revenue, while the increased number of operating systems placed in the quarter dampen short-term revenue growth for the quarter in which they're placed.  Operating leases include usage-based financings that we provide to certain hospitals with advanced robotics experience. We believe that our lease financing alternatives align with customer objectives and have enabled faster market adoption.  Relative to systems purchased over the lease period, we earned a small premium reflecting the time value of money. And in the case of usage-based arrangements, the risk that those systems may not achieve anticipated usage levels. The proportion of operating lease and usage-based arrangements will likely increase long term and will vary quarter-to-quarter.  We recognized $20 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared with $27 million last quarter and $8 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly from quarter to quarter and will likely continue to do so. 116 or 42% of current quarter system placements involve trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on our fourth generation technology and contributing to an Xi installed base growth of 41% year-over-year. This is an increase compared with 65 or 28% of system placements in the third quarter 2018 and 103 or 38% last quarter. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. However, given prior product trade-in cycles, we expect the proportion of installed base traded in in future quarters to decrease over time.  79% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 17% were da Vinci X systems compared with 74% da Vinci Xis and 20% da Vinci Xs last quarter.  We sold three Ion systems in the quarter. Ion system placements are excluded from our overall systems count and will be reported separately. Procedures and other information associated with Ion are excluded from our prepared remarks and will be reported separately when they become more substantive. Four of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems. Third quarter SP placements were impacted by our decision to hold shipments of endoscopes, as Gary outlined. Our rollout of SP Surgical System will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating lease revenue and lease buyouts, was approximately $1.57 million compared with $1.45 million last quarter and $1.54 million last quarter. Similar to the second quarter, our mix of systems and customers in the third quarter was very favorable relative to prior periods. We had a high mix of Xi versus X and Si systems. We also had a low mix of distributor versus direct sales.  Finally, in the third quarter of 2019, we had fewer multi-system arrangements where we provided volume discounts.  The mix of systems, customers and the size of arrangements will vary over time. We expect system ASPs to be in a range of the midpoint of the first two quarters of this year.  Outside of US, results were as follows. OUS procedures grew approximately 23% compared with the third quarter 2018 and increased 1% compared with last quarter. Third quarter revenue outside of the US of $332 million increased 36% compared with the third quarter of 2018 and increased 6% compared with last quarter. The increase compared with the prior year reflects increased system instruments and accessories revenue of $37 million or a 32% growth and increased systems revenue of $40 million or 50% growth. The increase in instrument and accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth and customer buying patterns. The increase in systems revenue primarily is the result of increased ASPs, reflecting favorable geographic and product mix. Outside of the US, we placed 90 systems in the third quarter compared with 75 in the third quarter of 2018 and 80 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 36 into Europe, 27 into Japan and 10 into China. 59% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 33% were da Vinci X systems compared with 43% da Vinci Xis and 48% da Vinci Xs last year. 21 of the system placements in the quarter were operating leases compared with 9 last year and 12 last quarter. Placements outside of the US will continue to vary as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government limitations. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter was 72% compared with 71.5% for the third quarter of 2018, and 71.3% last quarter. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2018 and last quarter primarily reflects higher system ASPs and product cost reductions. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency. We expect the return of the medical device tax in 2020, which will reduce our gross margin by approximately 70 basis points to 100 basis points.  Pro forma operating expenses increased 31% compared with the third quarter of 2018 and increased 7% compared with last quarter. Spending is consistent with our plan and includes an order of magnitude of increase, cost associated with the expansion of our OUS markets, spending on our informatics capabilities, and investment in our infrastructure in order to scale the business. We believe we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of minimally invasive surgery around the world and will continue to invest in the business accordingly. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 16.8%, reflecting $8 million of reserve releases primarily associated with the expiration of statutes of limitation in certain jurisdictions. While we expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 20% in the fourth quarter, our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of US and OUS income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our third quarter 2019 pro forma net income was $409 million or $3.43 per share compared with $337 million or $2.83 per share for the third quarter of 2018 and $388 million or $3.25 per share for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $397 million or $3.33 per share for the third quarter of 2019 compared with GAAP net income of $293 million or $2.45 per share for the third quarter of 2018 and GAAP net income of $318 million or $2.67 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.4 billion compared with $5.1 billion at June 30, 2019. The cash generated from operations was offset by stock repurchases, acquisition of Schölly Fiberoptic's 3D robotic endoscope business and investments in working capital and infrastructure during the quarter. We repurchased approximately 141,000 shares for $70 million at an average price of $493 per share. In the quarter, we grew inventory by approximately $67 million to $580 million, representing approximately 150 days of inventory. We continue to build inventory to address the growth in the business as well as mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supply or other matters. In summary, our results for the quarter were solid. While we will provide you with detailed 2020 guidance in January, I want to highlight certain business dynamics that may impact your models. As I noted earlier, we will continue to invest in the business, growing operating expenses as we see it, the substantial opportunity to expand the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.  We also believe the percentage of leasing and alternative financing arrangements will increase over time. In addition, we believe the number of trade-in transactions will level off in the short term and then decline over time. It is also likely we will see increased price negotiations and elongated negotiation timelines as competition get closer to launching new products. These dynamics could result in profit fluctuations. However, we will continue to manage the business for the long term as we believe that the fundamentals of the business are strong.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2019. 
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was nearly 20% compared to 20% during the third quarter of 2018 and 17% last quarter. Our Q3 procedure growth was driven by 18% growth in US procedures and 23% growth in OUS markets. Third quarter 2019 procedure growth benefited from one additional working day compared to last year. Through the three quarters, working days are now roughly consistent between this year and last. Our Q3 2019 year-to-date procedure growth was 18%, equal to 18% growth through three quarters of last year.  In the US, Q3 procedure growth was largely driven by continued strength in general surgery, with substantive contributions from gynecologic and urologic procedures. In US general surgery, third quarter growth in leading procedures, hernia repair and colorectal, remains solid at days adjusted growth rates consistent with last quarter.  Cholecystectomy growth continued to accelerate in the third quarter and now represents a significant driver of incremental procedures. While we remain cautious regarding the size of the addressable chole market for robotics, our recent data is encouraging. Growth in cholecystectomy represents a healthy mix of new and continuing surgeons, shows very little churn and sees increasing Firefly utilization. Bariatric procedures, while still not an area of broad emphasis, again accelerated modestly in Q3. Q3 US gynecology procedure growth was largely consistent with the first half of 2019 and last year, in the mid-single-digit range, with hysterectomy for cancer volumes accelerating modestly in the quarter. We had surprisingly strong growth in US urology and dVP procedures in the third quarter. dVP growth was just over 10% for the quarter after having moderated to low-single digits in Q2. As a highly penetrated mature procedure category, we believe that our US prostatectomy volume should track to the broader prostate surgery market. Third quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 23% compared with 23% for the third quarter of 2018 and 20% last quarter. Third quarter 2019 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology. In China, as in Q2, procedure growth accelerated modestly as new systems installed under the latest system quota began to provide additional capacity for incremental growth. The Q3 China procedure growth rate remained below the overall OUS metric. In Japan, procedure growth was again strong at roughly 40%, reflecting growth in procedures granted reimbursement status in April 2018 and continued later-stage growth in urology procedures. Our emphasis in Japan remains on surgeon and team training and building proctoring networks. Overall European procedure growth was largely consistent with prior periods with variation by country. German results were particularly strong, while results in the UK were below our plans. Now, turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Adoption of Intuitive systems for surgery is fundamentally based upon the clinical utility they provide for surgeons and positive procedure outcomes they enable for patients. We are now in the early stages of introducing the da Vinci SP to the market, and over 50 clinical articles have been published involving the SP thus far. Last month, some of the first clinical research related to da Vinci SP usage in transoral surgery was published by JAMA Otolaryngology, head and neck surgery section. The research titled A Next-Generation Single-Port Robotic Surgical System for Transoral Robotic Surgery, results from prospective non-randomized clinical trials, was authored by Dr. F. Christopher Holsinger from Stanford, et al. The objective of the study was to evaluate the da Vinci SP in head and neck surgery prospectively through concurrent non-randomized clinical trials. The study included a total of 47 patients across four institutions, three in the US and one in Hong Kong. All 47 patients had tumors of the oropharynx and underwent surgery with the da Vinci SP. 40 patients had malignant tumors, while seven were benign. All 47 patients, 8 women and 39 men, with a mean age of 61, safely underwent transoral resection with the da Vinci SP without conversion to open surgery, laser surgery or multi-port robotic surgery. There were no intraoperative complications or device-related serious adverse events.  Mean estimated intraoperative blood loss per procedure was 15.4 milliliters, with no patients – no patients received a transfusion. Within 30 days, 45 of the 47 patients were eating by mouth and without the need for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. The authors concluded, "the use of the device appears to be feasible, safe and effective for transoral robotic surgery of oropharyngeal tumors." I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2019, starting with procedures. Last quarter, we forecast 2019 procedure growth of 16% to 17%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full-year 2019 procedure growth of 17% to 18%. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2019 full-year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70% and 71% of net revenue. We are now slightly increasing our forecast and expect full-year gross profit margin to be between 71% and 71.5% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix, and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses. On our last call, we forecast to grow full-year pro forma 2019 operating expenses between 24% and 28% above 2018 levels. We are now retiring the top end of the range and expect our full-year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 24% and 27%. On our last call, we forecast our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $320 million and $340 million in 2019. We're now refining this estimate to the top half of the range between $330 million and $340 million. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $125 million and $130 million in 2019 compared to $130 million to $135 million forecast on our last call. With regard to income tax, apart from certain non-discrete items impacting Q3, we have a consistent view of our tax rate. We estimate our Q4 pro forma tax rate to be between 19% and 20% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions for me. Gary, just starting off on procedure acceleration. Even adjusting for selling, there's still a couple hundred basis points, maybe 200 basis points to 300 basis points of momentum acceleration into the third quarter. I wonder if you could talk about some of the drivers there. You talked about the gen surg capacity issues last quarter. Sounds that they've been resolved. But was that the principal driver of the momentum improvement or could just kind of point out other factors that drove this relative momentum acceleration into the third quarter? And then, I'd have a quick follow-up.
Gary Guthart: So, in general, general surgery was positive for us. I would not say that we have resolved all the constraint issues that we had talked about last quarter. We moved in the right direction. So, I think productivity for the US sales force was something we talked about last quarter. I think we took a modest step in the right way. We'll keep working on that. Likewise convenient access to systems. So, general surgery was strong for us, but I think there is more opportunity there over the long term. We had – and Calvin had touched on it, we were positively surprised in the urology part of the business, and we're digging in a little bit to figure out where that positive surprises come from. Calvin, I don't know if you want to add to that.
Calvin Darling: No, that's it. You saw us kind of settle in the low-single digits last quarter and just over 10% this quarter, and we are working with our field team and customers to better understand the dynamics behind that.
David Lewis: Okay. Very helpful, and maybe just a quick two-part question on broader CapEx. And, Gary, the gross system placements this quarter, I know trade-ins and retirements looked heavier, but gross system placements in the US looked a little lighter. Is there anything you've seen from a change in the capital environment in the US that you're willing to call out? And then related to that, Marshall, your commentary on next year competitive dynamics, maybe could you share with us what you've seen from some of these new systems that have now been displayed in the US and Europe, any comments you're willing to provide there and how your commercial strategy may change next year as you learn more about these systems? Thanks so much.
Gary Guthart: On the first front, I don't know that we're a perfect read on the CapEx environment more broadly. We do think that procedure growth is, in the US, the dominant driver of additional systems over time. System capability, but also clinical installed base, access. So, I think we saw in this quarter, met our expectations. I think the second question around spending looking into next year, I'll let Marshall take.
Marshall Mohr: Yeah. So, you were asking specifically about dynamics around potential competitors in my comment about the impacts that might have in terms of elongated negotiations or negotiations with customers. We know that when the competitors' products comes out that that will be an impact. When it comes out or when it will have an impact is less certain. And so, we're just trying to make sure that you understand that as those dynamics occur that you're not surprised.
Calvin Darling: Next question, please.
Operator: And next we turn to line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Lawrence Biegelsen: Good afternoon. And thanks for taking the question. Just maybe one follow-up to Marshall. On the operating margin and the OpEx spending that you talked about for next year, in the past, you've talked about not expecting constant deleveraging over time. But how should we think about margin pressure in 2020 relative to 2019 as you invest for top line growth and you potentially have new competition coming in? And I had one follow-up.
Marshall Mohr: Yeah. I think what you've heard from us and you've heard from others is that there is a substantial opportunity in front of us in terms the minimally invasive market. And so, we think about those opportunities. We think about the technology there necessary to take advantage of those to improve patient outcomes and we think about the global expansion. And so, that's where we're spending our money. We'll give you more precise guidance on what spending we'll do when we get to the January call. So, I'm not going to really comment at this point about magnitude of leverage or deleverage or whatever. But we will continue to spend on expansion.
Lawrence Biegelsen: That's helpful. And then, to stay on the 2020 theme, Calvin, on the guidance, the implied Q4, it's somewhere about 15% at the midpoint for procedure growth. Should we be thinking about more of the high-end here Calvin and maybe if you could talk about the puts and takes for next year. You have some good growth drivers from general surgery and international. Should we be thinking about kind of stability in procedure growth Thanks for taking the questions.
Calvin Darling: Yeah. I think as you look at Q4 and then further out into 2020, the growth drivers, as you say, Larry, are general surgery in the United States as well as growth outside the United States, and I think that's likely to continue to be the drivers. At the high end of the guidance range, I think we're seeing consistency with where we are on a year-to-date basis. But, again, in the third quarter, we saw benefit for some of the mature categories. I think at the lower end, you can contemplate some moderation there.
Lawrence Biegelsen: Thanks, guys.
Operator: And next we turn to the line of Rob Hopkins with Bank of America.
Robert Hopkins: Thanks. And good afternoon. I just wanted to ask a couple of quick questions on the comments you guys made on SP in the prepared remarks. It sounds like the regulatory pathway is moving around a little bit. Gary, is that a function of something specific with your process or is it just a tougher regulatory environment generally with the FDA with these new robotic platforms?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I think it's probably the latter. As you look at both our products that are moving into new clinical domains and also a little more broadly across the med device industry, it looks like the environment is becoming more data centric or the data requirements are increasing.
Robert Hopkins: And then, also just wondering if you could characterize kind of the demand for SP generally and what your comments imply about kind of next year's growth opportunity in SP. Should we be thinking it's fairly limited until you get colorectal or do you see enough underlying demand that 2020 could see some nice sales of that product?
Gary Guthart: We won't forecast it for you yet on this call. I think, in general, there is an opportunity for the indications that we have and more indications are better. The clinical data that we're seeing and that's building in the database reinforces my support for the product line long-term. And I think there is also a set of indications beyond the colorectal that will be interesting to us. That said, we'll work with regulatory bodies to meet their requirements and that may take some time. That will pace us. So, near term, as we get closer to 2020 and get into it, we'll talk a little more about it.
Robert Hopkins: Thanks so much.
Operator: And we have a question from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Thanks. I want to go back to some of the procedure commentary. The cholecystectomy recovery, can you comment on what you think might be driving that? And then, to your comments on the dVP step up, any early view on what might be behind that? Is that patients dropping out a watchful waiting or is there another dynamic there?
Calvin Darling: Yeah. On the chole side, Tycho, talked about the acceleration being driven by a healthy mix of the new surgeons and existing surgeons, not a lot of churn and increasing Firefly utilization. So, that feels a lot different than, say, our earlier experience with single site set of tools or it was more of a cosmesis-oriented value proposition. And what's interesting is, while in the past, chole may have been a popular training procedure, and it still can be that, now it's not necessarily the first procedure. It's a lot more often that it's, say, a hernia repair that's the first procedure. And as general surgeons are applying robotics across their practices, chole obviously a big part of what they do. So, there are reasons for optimism given what we see in the data, but we continue to monitor and analyze the growth trends closely and remain conservative about the overall opportunity.
Gary Guthart: On prostatectomy
Calvin Darling: Yeah, prostatectomy, I think we've pretty much stated on that. We were surprised and we're kind of digging into what the root causes may be.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then, on SP, it sounds like you worked through the endoscope issues in relatively short order. Should we think about any sort of catch-up effect in the fourth quarter in terms of installations? And then, any comments you want to make on the IDE trial, how big you think that might have to be?
Gary Guthart: On the SP endoscope, we have released supply and – but we still have some work to do and we will work through it really for SP endoscopy at scale. So, we can support the scale we're at today, but as we get bigger and what our long-term plans are, I want to see improvements in that product line. So, we will see – we're not ready to describe what the outlines of the trial yet are. Indeed, it finalizes in IDE, that will get published in public database and you'll be able to look it up and we'll point you to it.
Tycho Peterson: All right. And then lastly, any comments you can make on ASPs? I think, last quarter, there was a view that they would maybe step down, but, obviously, they didn't. So I'm just curious how we should be thinking about system ASPs going forward?
Marshall Mohr: Yeah. I think it's pretty specific in my remarks actually. For ASPs this quarter, we just saw a really favorable mix just like last quarter in terms of Xis and Xs and Sis. We also saw a really favorable mix in terms of lower distributor and higher direct sales. As far as what you should expect going forward, I think what I said was for the remainder of this year. You should look at ASPs more similar to the mix between Q1 and Q2. And that's where we see it coming out, and that will reflect a higher mix of distribution sales in Q4, which is typical if you go back and look in our history.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next we turn to the line of J.P. McKim with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Jonathan McKim: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch on just the uplift in instrument ASPs. Can you talk about maybe, A, the sustainability there and just what's really driving? Is it more advanced procedures or just more advanced instruments with the staplers and vessel sealers?
Calvin Darling: Yeah. Hi, J.P. It's Calvin. Yeah, we saw this – in this quarter, revenue per procedure was approximately $1,980 and that's the highest we've seen in quite some time. Marshall mentioned in his comments that we did see a benefit relative to the last quarter just due to timing of orders, but, obviously, higher usage of the advanced stapling and vessel sealings also contributed to the growth. Going forward, clearly, the favorable timing of the orders should offset, but there is a number of factors that are going to kind of impact the trend going in different directions, including the anticipated continued growth in the advanced instrument usage, offset by an increasing proportion of lower complexity cases like cholecystectomy that we've talked about. So, I&A revenue per procedure is going to have variability quarter to quarter and I don't have a long-term direction to give you.
Jonathan McKim: Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe just on – you've got the chest conference coming up this weekend. Maybe what can we or should we expect from you guys in terms of Ion, any single site data? And then, maybe what investors should be looking for in terms of the right way to sort of compare systems or what really is going to drive adoption and surgeon interest?
Calvin Darling: So, the conference, I think what you're going to see is a lot of what we've talked about on this call. We're going to talk about just qualitatively, I think, some of the early experiences in the field. We'll be doing a lot of test drives and talking about the system and its capabilities. I don't think – there is no new data that I think is going to be groundbreaking at the event.
Gary Guthart: In general, I think you'll see, from both sides, relatively early data. I think the larger market in Ion and robotic-assisted bronchoscopy will be data oriented in broader settings, looking at safety and efficacy. And as that develops, I think we're feeling pretty good. There have been systems in the market in the past, as you know, and I think a fair number of accounts, we'll wait to see what the data says. So, there is the future benefit kind of conversations that happen in the early market. I think a lot of the market will wait to see what that expresses like in clinical use.
Jonathan McKim: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to just follow up on chole. So, I know that – I believe chole is a faster procedure relative to some of the more complex areas where the robot gets used. So, I'm just curious the extent to which you think just acceleration, kind of staying power, could that help alleviate some of the capacity and training issues that you've outlined in the past with respect to the mix of the types of procedures getting done?
Gary Guthart: I think it can change, certainly, the utilization rate for systems in the field. It can still create access challenges as different people vie for time. But as you just described, if they are faster through it.  With regard to training, I think that high volume procedures allow surgeons to move through their early experiences more quickly, and that has a generally positive net effect.
Richard Newitter: Great. And I was hoping – thanks for the color on the China procedure growth metrics relative to the overall OUS. I was just curious, as you have more systems getting placed each quarter, how many quarters you think it might take to get – approaching the international average? And I think it would be helpful just to know where was the growth rate trending in the last two quarters. Thanks. Relative to this quarter.
Gary Guthart: Right. So, the overall OUS growth rate is roughly 23%. And in the last two quarters, we've seen some modest acceleration. We're probably approaching that right now. So, a successful scenario in the next quarter or two, we may crossover.
Richard Newitter: Thank you.
Operator: And next we turn to the line of Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Imron Zafar: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Gary, you highlighted in your prepared remarks the stapling franchise. Can you talk a little bit more about, I guess, the 60 millimeter in particular and the impact you're seeing in terms of specific procedures, where you're seeing the uptake? Is it colorectal versus gastric sleeve? And then also, how much cannibalization are you seeing of the 45 millimeter in cases like bowel resection, et cetera?
Gary Guthart: 60s mostly used in the lower abdomen. So, you definitely have stomach and in colorectal. There is modest exchange for the 45s where a 60 will do, [indiscernible]. But in general, I think that mix and surgeon selection in that space is pretty well understood from prior experience with laparoscopy. And we're not overly stressed about it.
Imron Zafar: Okay. And then, in Japan, I know last quarter you talked about some sequential slow down, but the metrics you gave today, the 40% plus procedure growth and healthy placements, I think 27, can you just talk about the contributors to procedure growth there? Is it still urology, non-dVP urology or general surgery mostly? And then, are you expecting more procedure reimbursement approvals in April 2020?
Calvin Darling: Yeah. So, as I mentioned on the call, a move back to 40% where we had been prior to last quarter. Last quarter, I think we largely felt the effect of a number of holidays or a fewer workdays in the quarter than this quarter where that recovered. So, that was the main thing. We're seeing increasing numbers of the 12 procedures that were granted reimbursement status in April of 2018, as well as continuing to see adoption of the urology procedures.
Gary Guthart: We don't think that the – of the 12 that were adopted, equal rate. And we'll see some start to break out from the pack, whether it's in colorectal or thoracic relative to some of the others. With regard to reimbursement opportunities going forward, it's something we track and we discuss with surgical societies for their support as needed. We'll see nothing to communicate with you at this time.
Imron Zafar: Thank you very much.
Operator: Next we turn to line of Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Craig Bijou: Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Gary, on SP, I think you mentioned that you might be looking at other indications. So, I guess, I just wanted to get a sense for. Given the IDE that will be required for colorectal, could we see another indication come in before seeing colorectal?
Gary Guthart: I can give you no reason to be optimistic for that.
Craig Bijou: Okay, fair enough. And then, Marshall, just your comments on the med device tax. I just wanted to – you said that you expected to come in – and I just wanted to get – is that just you being conservative or assuming that it will come in 2020 or is there anything else behind that comment?
Marshall Mohr: At this point, that is what is supposed to happen. I know there is lobbying efforts to try to change that. So, we're just telling you the way it is.
Craig Bijou: Also fair enough. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.
Gary Guthart: Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Jason Mills: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to follow up, Calvin, on the revenue per procedure. You've given us that data fairly consistently. So, [indiscernible] things would have to change quite significantly across several different procedures for that trend line to change over, let's say, the next three years. So, it's been on a nice, fairly decent upward slope. What would you say, I guess, over the longer term with respect to that trend line, given you have so much data, but it is a dynamic business? It would seem like it could continue to trend upward with some volatility quarter to quarter, but upward over a longer period of time. Maybe tell me what I'm missing, if that's incorrect
Calvin Darling: It has been increasing in low-single digits the last couple of years, anyway. I tried to mention that we do expect to see a continued contribution from the advanced instruments as a tailwind to the metric, but that's being offset by a number of factors. I mentioned increasing proportion of lower complexity cases. And fact is people are just becoming all the more efficient as time goes on as well, wasting less, doing less with more, and we help them to do that with some of the analytics we provide. So, those are the offsets. And so, you have the gives and the takes. So, at this point. I'm not ready to say whether the trend is going to continue up or be flat or trend down.
Jason Mills: Okay, fair enough. And, obviously, the big reveal, one of the competitors recently, the number that they continue to harp on was 2% robotic surgery relative to procedures done, whether it be general laparoscopic. I was wondering if you could, perhaps Gary, comment on that number from your perspective. Obviously, much more broad. If you could comment on that number or just give any general commentary as it relates to robotic surgery penetration. I know you talk qualitatively about it being early innings, but just specifically that quantitative figure, I'd like your thoughts. And then, specific to Japan as it relates to the penetration of robotic surgery, it would seem to be lower than that. I'd like your commentary with respect to that geography specifically, if you don't mind. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Let's zoom out for a second and then we can zoom back in. I think the opportunity for computer-aided and robotically assisted surgery and acute intervention more broadly is clearly substantial and clearly durable. And that's going to draw in new entrants, which it's doing. I think those new entrants will help accelerate broader adoption more generally and customers will appreciate that choice. And I think they will look at that. Our strategy over this period has really been, understand our customers deeply and understand the quadruple aim. It's really hard to do the total accounting of what the total available market will be.  And what I'd ask you to look at is over time. What does it look like in the next couple of years? What does it look like in the next four? What does it look like in the next 10? I think some of our competitors as they speak about these opportunities are looking out pretty far. And, okay, that's a forecast. Hard to have an exact crystal ball. But, clearly, even speaking with our most candid critics, the idea that computer aids and robotics are going to make an impact more broadly in surgery is pretty well accepted. So, I think we're early innings. Japan, I think likewise. A little bit different healthcare system. The single payer system that runs through MHLW or the predominantly single-payer system means that their requirements and negotiations using data with the government early are much more important and getting those right opened the market over time, and that's what we've been working on. So, clearly, that's an early set of opportunities for us as well. Our methodology, when we think about total available market, is to be conservative in the early days, show that we can bring real value and then revise as we see greater depth. Other companies take a different statistical approach to that.
Jason Mills: Thank you so much.
Operator: And next we turn to the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Vijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just tacking on that last question, Gary. If just look at the medium-term outlook, right, just given where we are in the CapEx cycle, given the amount of product cycles that you guys have on a number of different platforms, where – I know, historically, you looked at utilization rates as being – on the system utilization rates – the growth in system utilization as being a leading indicator for systems. Is this now – given the acceleration we're seeing in procedures, is that a leading indicator for our systems? Like, you just give us a sense for what drives that systems next year because, obviously, you have competition. I'm just curious, given why we're seeing base procedures accelerating, is that an indicator for how we should be modeling systems?
Gary Guthart: I'll just draw a broader picture and I'll let Calvin speak to a little bit of the modeling. In the broader sense, we know that in a mature market that has experience with robotic surgery that procedure demand will drive the underlying system demand, and there's two ways that they go about it. One is capacity and they can get additional capacity by more efficient utilization of their systems. We have designed our systems with that in mind. We work closely with them and in various arrangements to help them get improved efficiency. They don't have to buy an X system if they don't want to. The other thing is feature content. Does the product have the feature content that's required to do the procedures they want to do? And so, we work with them on those things. Clearly, competitors will enter the market and make claims. And I guess what I would say for both customers and for shareholders, due diligence is really important. It's really easy to make claims on trade show floors and it's pretty hard to back them up in real life. And our experience in the world has been that there is a lot of noise in the beginning as those claims are made and then it takes a couple or three years in the actual clinical market and clinical use to see what the broad market thinks about that. That will have an impact for us in the next few years. I don't know if it's next year or the year after, and I think that's what Marshall's commentary was. Signaling is that customers will evaluate and will take their time and that may change capital acquisition cycle timelines or otherwise and they change the nature of negotiations for us. But we're planning and thinking for the long term and we're focused on enablement of the quadruple aim and we'll be here for our customers as we go through that. Calvin, anything you want to help with our modeling?
Calvin Darling: No, clearly, procedures are the catalyst for driving the demand for systems. When we look at our models, we would expect to see a continuation of the trend of increasing utilization over time.
Gary Guthart: Vijay, if you have a short follow-up, this is your chance. One last one.
Vijay Kumar: One quick follow-up, Gary. Headcount is up 30%, up from 5,000 to – we've crossed 7,000. That's an impressive, phenomenal number. I'm just curious now where that is going. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. We try to balance our growth and our investments by both the opportunity and we think the opportunity is enormous and durable. And then, we balance it by what we think we can achieve and do well. And that really is what caps our growth in our spend. Absorbing, training, selecting, developing staff during rapid growth is really the challenge and that's what we are focused on. As we get into 2020, 2021 and we'll share with you in future quarters what our plans are, but we try to balance those two things, being agile and pursuing the opportunity; at the same time, making sure we're not over extended and losing our ability to execute and be efficient. So, thank you, that was our last question.
Gary Guthart: In closing, we believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute intervention. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim – better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately a lower total cost of treatment. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human that flows from respect for, and understanding of, patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-18 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q2 2019 Earnings Release Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2019, and 10-Q filed on April 19, 2019. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results, then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2019. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. The second quarter of 2019 was a solid one for Intuitive with healthy customer interest and demand for our products. Overall procedure growth met our expectations, while capital placements exceeded them. Global procedure growth was approximately 17% in the second quarter of 2019. Growth again centered on general surgery in the United States, with positive contributions to the global growth rate from Germany, France, and Japan. In China, we are pleased with procedure performance, given the recent release of systems under the new quota. Turning to the United States, year-over-year growth in the quarter was 16%. General surgery growth again accounted for the largest increase year-over-year, accompanied by expected moderation of growth in U.S. urology and gynecology. Underlying this performance, we saw a continued strength in bariatrics and cholecystectomy, with modest tempering of growth rate in hernia and colon resection. Given the different types of procedures being performed by general surgeons, we see additional demands on system access and accounts as well as increased demands on our representatives' time to support different procedure types.  We believe system placement strength in the U.S. is driven in part by the desire of general surgeons for increased access. We have efforts ongoing to manage these issues. Calvin will take you through global procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call. With regard to our installed base, placement of new systems in the quarter was strong with growth in total placements rising 24% from Q2 of 2018. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci installed base again grew 13% over Q2 2018 to approximately 5,270. The mix of system placements this quarter moved towards our flagship Xi System, while both sales of X Systems and trade-ins remained healthy. The proportions of systems placed under operating leases was 32% this quarter compared with 33% last quarter. We do not anticipate this quarter-to-quarter variance is indicative of a larger trend in leasing.  With regard to capital average sales price, the mix of systems and geographies last quarter resulted in a lower ASP when compared to historical trends. The second quarter saw a reversal of mix dynamics, with more fully featured system sales and a greater proportion of system placements in direct markets, resulting in an ASP that is higher than recent quarterly averages. As we said last quarter, this variance in ASP quarter-to-quarter is the result of system and regional mix, not a fundamental change in our philosophy. Turning to expenses, we continue to invest as we launch new platforms, strengthen our computational capabilities, and execute projects that support future scale and provide leverage opportunities as we grow. Our spending met our expectations, falling within the range of projections we shared with you last quarter and supported by solid procedure growth and capital placements.  Financial highlights of our second quarter results are as follows: Procedures grew approximately 17% over the second quarter of last year; we placed 273 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 220 in the second quarter of 2018; our installed base again grew 13% from a year ago; revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, up 21%; pro forma gross profit margin was 71.3% compared to 71.1% in the second quarter last year; instrument and accessory revenue increased to $579 million, up 22%; total recurring revenue in the quarter was $780 million, growing 21% over Q2 of 2018 and representing 71% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $455 million in the quarter, up 17% from the second quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $388 million, up 18%. As you know, we measure our efforts by their ability to positively impact the quadruple aim: better outcomes, better patient experience, better care team experience, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode.  We believe intelligent surgery takes the integration of 3 elements: first, a deep understanding of human interactions that inform holistic system design; second, the development of high-quality, smart and cloud-connected robotic imaging and instrument systems; and lastly, informatics and AI to deliver relevant validated insights. For our customers, surgery has been digitized for the past 20 years. While we've made significant progress over our history, we believe continuous improvement is required and we have deployed our investment toward these aims.  We design instruments and accessories to enable repeatable, high-quality surgeries that are efficient and cost-effective relating to total cost to treat. Taking one example of our advanced instrument platforms, our second-generation SureForm staplers are now in the market at both 60-millimeter and 45-millimeter instrument lengths and represent product families. Our 60-millimeter stapler has 4 staple lengths available and is sold in the U.S., Europe, Korea, Australia and now Japan. Our 45-millimeter SureForm stapler has 5 different staple-length cartridges as well as a straight-tip and curved-tip instrument and is available in initial launch in the United States and our direct EU markets. Measured through Q2, surgeons have fired Intuitive staplers clinically over 1 million times cumulatively since our stapling launch. Turning to systems, we are in the first phase of launch of da Vinci SP. We installed 13 systems in Q2 to bring our clinical installed base of SP to 34. Our teams have done a nice job resolving the manufacturing variances that slowed our installs in Q1. The highest per system utilization of SP is occurring in Korea, where regulatory clearances support the access to a large range of clinical applications. The Korean experience with SP is encouraging with regard to the broad possibilities for our platform. In Korea, procedures in urology, gynecology, general surgery and head and neck surgery are being performed.  In the United States, we have two cleared indications for SP: urologic and transoral surgery. As you know, we're pursuing additional clinical indications for SP and have engaged regulatory agencies regarding their requirements. These requirements are in discussion, which implies projected timelines for additional indications are not yet available. Our pipeline of interested SP customers is healthy, and the combination of additional indications for SP and our readiness for deployment at larger scale pace the speed of our SP commercial expansion.  In flexible diagnostics, our Ion platform is focused on the need for accurate, timely biopsies to support definitive early diagnosis of suspicious lung cancers -- lesions for lung cancer. Ion received FDA clearance in the first quarter. With 510(k) clearance, we've initiated our next phase focused on clinical use, customer feedback, and production optimization. First cases on the cleared system were performed at the end of Q1, and we plan a measured rollout this year. Placements to date are at hospital sites collecting data. So far, 3 have been initiated and over 50 procedures have been performed so far. We're pleased with early clinical results and look forward to our customers' continued progress. We expect commercial placements to commence in the next few months along with the initiation of additional clinical collection sites. We do not anticipate material revenue from Ion in 2019.  Turning to imaging and analytics, this week, we announced the acquisition of the 3D robotic endoscope business from our long-time supplier, Schölly Fiberoptic. The transaction is subject to closing conditions and thereafter, we look forward to welcoming their employees to the Intuitive team. Leading visualization has been a core pillar of our offerings and we believe it is essential to the future of intelligent surgery. This acquisition strengthens our design and supply chain capabilities and increases our manufacturing capacity for imaging products. For the balance of the year, our focus remains in completing the tasks we set for ourselves: first, supporting adoption of da Vinci in general surgery and in key procedures in global markets; second, launching our SP and Ion platforms; third, driving intelligent surgery innovation; and finally, supporting additional clinical and economic validation in our focus procedures and countries. Before I turn the call over to Marshall, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Sal Brogna, who announced his intention to step back from day-to-day operations after 20 years at Intuitive. Sal has made enormous contributions to building our product line, our capabilities and, in the past few years, our leadership team. I extend my personal thanks and that of the company for his efforts over these past 2 decades. We anticipate working with Sal post-transition on projects of mutual interest. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I'll describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Key business metrics for the second quarter were as follows: Second quarter 2019 procedures increased approximately 17% compared with the second quarter of 2018, and increased approximately 7% compared with last quarter; procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. Second quarter system placements of 273 systems increased 24% compared with 220 systems last year, and increased 16% compared with 235 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems by 17% to approximately 5,270 systems. This growth is consistent with last quarter and slightly higher than the 12.5% increase last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, grew approximately 3.5%, which is slightly lower than last quarter growth of approximately 4%, and below the 5% growth last year. Our revenue overview is as follows: Second quarter 2019 revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of 21% compared with $909 million for the second quarter of 2018, and an increase of 13% compared with $974 million last quarter. Instrument and accessory revenue of $579 million increased 22% compared with last year, which is higher than procedure growth, primarily reflecting customer buying patterns and increased usage of our advanced instruments. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,920, an increase of 4% compared with the second quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 2% compared with last quarter. Systems revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $344 million, an increase of 24% compared with the second quarter of 2018 and an increase of 39% compared with last quarter. Systems revenue in the quarter reflected higher system placements, higher ASPs and higher lease-related revenue. We completed 88 operating lease transactions, representing 32% of total placements compared with 44 or 20% of total placements in the second quarter of 2018, and 78 or 33% of total placements last quarter. As of June 30, we have 486 operating leases outstanding and realized approximately $25 million of revenue related to these arrangements in the quarter compared with $12 million last year and $20 million last quarter. Operating leases create a future source of recurring revenue and reduce the volatility of system revenue, while the increased number of operating leases placed in the quarter dampens short-term revenue growth for the quarter in which they are placed.  Operating leases included usage-based financings that we provide to certain experienced hospitals. We believe that our lease financing alternatives align with customer objectives and have enabled faster market adoption. Related to systems purchased over the lease period, we earn a small premium, reflecting the time value of money, and in the case of usage-based arrangements, the risk that those systems may not achieve the anticipated usage levels. The proportion of these types of arrangements could increase long term and will vary quarter-to-quarter. We recognized $27 million of lease buyout revenue in the quarter compared with $12 million last quarter and $13 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter and will likely to do so. We do not expect the second quarter buyout -- level of buyout revenue to repeat. 38% of the current quarter system placements involved trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on fourth-generation technology. This is an increase in the proportion of trade-ins compared to 34% in the second quarter of 2018 and 36% last quarter. 74% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 20% were da Vinci X systems compared with 67% da Vinci Xis and 25% da Vinci Xs last quarter. 13% of the systems placed were SP systems. Our rollout of the SP surgical system is measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts, was approximately $1.54 million compared with $1.42 million last year and $1.31 million last quarter.  Our mix of systems and customers in the second quarter of 2019 was very favorable relative to prior periods. We had a high mix of Xi versus X and SI systems. We also had a low mix of distributor versus direct sales. In the second quarter of 2019, we also had fewer multisystem arrangements where we provided volume discounts. The mix of systems, customers and size of arrangements will vary over time. We expect system ASPs to be in the range of the midpoint of the first 2 quarters. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: OUS procedures grew approximately 20% compared with the second quarter of 2018 and increased 4% compared with last quarter. Second quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $314 million increased 19% compared with the second quarter of 2018 and increased 11% compared with last quarter. The increase compared with the prior year reflects increased instruments and accessory revenue of $34 million or 29% growth. The increase in instrument accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth and customer buying patterns. Outside of the U.S., we placed 80 systems in the second quarter compared with 82 in the second quarter of 2018 and 81 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 30 into Europe, 24 into Japan, and 8 into China. 61% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis and 33% were da Vinci X systems compared with 38% da Vinci Xis and 44% da Vinci Xs last quarter. 12 of the system placements were operating leases compared with 6 last year and 11 last quarter. Placements outside of the U.S. will continue to vary as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption; some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns; and sales into some markets are constrained by government limitations. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was 71.3% compared with 71.1% for the second quarter of 2018 and 71.2% last quarter. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2018 and last quarter primarily reflects higher system ASPs. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our new products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency. Pro forma operating expenses increased 27% compared with the second quarter of 2018 and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. Spending is consistent with our plan and includes, in order of magnitude of increase, costs associated with expansion of our OUS markets, spending on our informatics capabilities, and investment in our infrastructure in order to scale the business. Our pro forma tax rate for the second quarter was 20% and within our expectations of 19% to 20%. Our tax rates will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income, changes in taxation made by local authorities, and with the impact of onetime items. Our 2020 tax rate will increase with the return of the medical device tax. Our second quarter 2019 pro forma net income was $388 million or $3.25 per share compared with $327 million or $2.76 per share for the second quarter of 2018 and $312 million or $2.61 per share for the last -- for last quarter. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $318 million or $2.67 per share for the second quarter of 2019 compared with GAAP net income of $255 million or $2.15 per share for the second quarter of 2018 and GAAP net income of $307 million or $2.56 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website, and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.1 billion, approximately the same as March 31, 2019. Cash generated from operations was offset by stock repurchases and investments in working capital and infrastructure during the quarter. We repurchased approximately 400,000 shares for $200 million at an average purchase price of $477 per share. In the quarter, we grew inventory by $45 million to $513 million, representing approximately 140 days of inventory. We continue to build inventory to address the growth in the business as well as mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supply or other matters. With the growth in the business and our focus on efficiency and scale, we expect our capital expenditures will increase to over $250 million in 2019. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin, who will go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2019.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 17% compared to 18% during the second quarter of 2018 and last quarter. Our Q2 procedure growth was driven by 16% growth in U.S. procedures and 20% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., Q2 procedure results were generally consistent with recent trends. Q2 growth was again driven by growth in U.S. general surgery, thoracic and benign gynecology procedures. Q2 2019 U.S. procedure growth was 16% compared to 17% last year and last quarter, reflecting anticipated slight moderation in mature urology and gynecology procedures and general surgery growth rates. In U.S. general surgery, second quarter hernia repair and colorectal procedure growth remained solid, although at slightly lower growth rates than last quarter and last year. Other general surgery procedures such as cholecystectomy, bariatric and liver and pancreatic cases made increasing contributions to growth in Q2, with higher growth rates than last quarter. As anticipated, U.S. procedure growth in mature urology and gynecology procedure categories moderated in Q2 compared to last year. U.S. gynecology growth and urology growth were in the mid-single digits. dVP growth specifically was in the low single-digit range, in close alignment with the underlying incident rate for prostate cancer. As a mature procedure category, we believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. In other U.S. procedures, adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was again solid during the second quarter.  Second quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 20% compared with 22% for the second quarter 2018 and 21% last quarter. Second quarter 2019 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier-stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology. Q2 OUS procedure growth faced modest working day headwinds due to the timing of the Easter holiday, mostly affecting Europe, and other national holidays, particularly in Japan. Japan procedure growth remains strong but moderated somewhat in Q2, reflecting lower growth rates in mature urology procedures as we reach higher levels of market penetration, the impact of holidays, and the anniversary of the new procedure reimbursements.  In China, after several quarters of declining procedure growth, procedure growth accelerated slightly in Q2, driven by procedures performed on new systems installed under the latest system quota. In Europe, procedure growth was driven by strong results in Germany and France. Overall, European procedure growth was largely consistent with prior periods, with variation by country. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certainly recent published studies of note. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. We are pleased to see the evidence landscape regarding our recently cleared Ion endoluminal system start to grow. A manuscript describing the first term and use experience, led by Dr. David Fielding from the Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, has recently been accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed medical journal, Respiration. Previously presented at the annual CHEST Conference in 2017, this study was designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the Ion endoluminal platform and included 29 consecutive subjects with follow-up data through 6 months. Although each nodule was located in the peripheral part of the lung and the mean nodule size was approximately 15 millimeters, approximately 97% of the nodules were reached, with a tissue sample suitable for assessment obtained. Importantly, across the entire study population, no instances of pneumothorax, bleeding or device-related adverse events were reported, suggesting a good safety profile.  We believe that further scientific study and clinical evidence will be essential to build the market for Ion. Soon after receiving FDA clearance for Ion in the U.S., we initiated a post-market clinical study called PRECISE, intending to enroll 360 subjects across 6 key centers in the United States. Full details regarding the construct of the PRECISE study are available on the web at ClinicalTrials.gov.  In May of this year, a large scale, real-world comparative study using the National Cancer Database was published in the journal, Colorectal Disease. The analysis, led by Dr. Ravi Kiran from NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, compared the results of over 41,000 patients from between 2010 and 2015 by surgical approach. The National Cancer Database captures data from over 1,500 cancer-accredited facilities and represents approximately 70% of newly diagnosed cancer cases. The population for the study consisted of approximately 15% robotic-assisted, 33% laparoscopic and 52% open procedures. In propensity score-matched analysis, with over 4,000 subjects in each cohort, comparing the robotic LAR approach to the laparoscopic approach, the robotic LAR was associated with shorter length of stay, 6.3 days versus 6.8 days; and lower risk of conversion to open, 7.5% versus 14.95%; with multivariate analysis showing laparoscopic LAR patients being 2.2x more likely to be converted to open. Compared to open LAR, the robotic-assisted approach had shorter length of stay, 6.3 days versus 7.8 days; a higher rate of negative margins, 97.01% versus 95.96%; and higher nodal yield, 17 versus 16.4. The authors concluded, and I quote, "For patients with rectal cancer, robotic LAR shows recovery benefits over both open and laparoscopic LAR, with reduced conversion to open compared with laparoscopic LAR and less prolonged length of stay compared with laparoscopic LAR and open LAR. Robotic LAR is associated with short-term oncological outcomes comparable to open LAR, supporting its use in minimally-invasive surgery for rectal cancer." I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2019. Starting with procedures. Last quarter, we forecast 2019 procedure growth of 15% to 17%. We are now refining our forecast to the upper half of this range and expect full year 2019 procedure growth of 16% to 17%. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2019 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect to come in at the higher end of that range. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2019 operating expenses between 24% and 28% above 2018 levels. We continue to expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $320 million and $340 million in 2019. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $130 million and $135 million in 2019, up from $120 million to $130 million forecast on our last call. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2019 pro forma income tax rate to be between 19% and 20% of pretax income.  That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.
Robert Hopkins: So first question, I wanted to ask about U.S. procedure growth. By our math, the overall Q2 U.S. growth on the procedure side accelerated a little bit when you take into consideration the year ago comp, but you called out some slight moderation in hernia and colorectal. So I was wondering if you could just talk about that a little bit. Like was that -- was the growth you experienced in hernia and colorectal this quarter different than you expected? And how do you manage through this issue of kind of managing access?
Gary Guthart: This is Gary. We saw a tad of moderation. I think demand remains strong, and what we're really seeing is what we indicated to you. We have two things going on. One is there are a lot of different procedure types, and now, in busy centers, competition for system access. We can of course solve that with additional systems placed as well as work with folks on efficiency of use. And we're doing both. And you've heard that from us over the last several quarters. The next one is our commercial teams have been growing in the United States to support the growth of the company. And it takes some time to have teams come up to full productivity and we're -- the percentage of new folks in new territories has been ticking up the last couple of quarters. And it's -- the new ratio is amongst the highest we've had in the last few. Employee retention has been great. It's really around increased need to get increased case coverage, and so there, it's supporting our new folks in the field with tools and some of it is just time on task.
Calvin Darling: Yes. Bob, from just a pure mathematical standpoint, you know we track adoption curves pretty regularly around here. And it's a mathematical reality that really all points along the curve, the rate of growth actually declines. So our results here in Q2 is aligned with what we would have expected. And clearly, there's a lot -- substantial remaining opportunity in both hernia and colorectal procedures, and our checks with surgeons generally indicate healthy demand.
Robert Hopkins: That's great. And then just one on the system side because revenue growth from system sales this quarter was much higher than the first quarter due to mix, as you called out. But the placement numbers and the placement growth in both quarters suggest very strong underlying demand for your systems in both quarters. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the differences you saw from Q1 to Q2 in that mix dynamic and what that suggests about the outlook for the rest of the year on the system side.
Marshall Mohr: This is Marshall. We have seen, as you suggested, reasonable strength in terms of system placements. I don't think there's anything really different quarter-to-quarter other than the mix. In other words, the buying behaviors of the customers hasn't changed. We're seeing a nice cycle on trade-ups. And -- but we did see, again, more Xis this quarter. And there's volatility or variability between quarter-to-quarter as it relates to particularly our distribution channel. And so we saw fewer distributor sales this quarter and more direct sales. And our direct sales are at a higher price than what we sell to our distributors as they incurred the selling costs associated with those systems. So that's really -- that's the color that we would provide on systems revenue.
Gary Guthart: Marshall, is it fair to look at it and say, if you view the first half as a whole rather than in different quarters, you'd get a better picture?
Marshall Mohr: That's true, Gary. You should -- when you look at ASPs, you should think about the combination of the 2 because 1.31 was a low point and 1.54 is a high point.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Maybe I'll just follow-up on that last question. Why should ASPs take a little bit of a step back? You did -- you skew more toward fully featured system sales. Obviously, your procedure mix is expanding. Why logically should ASPs step down a little bit going forward?
Marshall Mohr: You should expect that the -- again, distributor sales tend to be variable quarter-to-quarter. So, I think you should blend the first quarter and the second quarter when you're looking at what level of the distributor sales you should expect. And I think same thing with the mix of Xi and X, just depending on the geography, X is targeting geographies where reimbursements are pressured. And so this quarter, just based on mix, we wound up selling fewer Xs and that should even out as well.
Tycho Peterson: And we've had a couple of quarters now of operating leases in kind of the low 30s, it was 29% at the end of last year. Is this kind of the new norm in your view? Or how should we think about operating leases in terms of mix going forward?
Marshall Mohr: I don't think about it as a norm. I think that there's going to be variability quarter-to-quarter. And yes, Q2 is slightly lower, if not close to being the same as Q1. But I think, over time, we will accommodate customers, and we think that on the other hand, leases are positive for the company in that they -- as I said in my prepared remarks, it increases the recurring revenue. It eliminates volatility. It also enables an upgrade cycle when and if new systems come out. So we think it's a positive and so we'll supply those to customers as they ask for them. I would guess that over time -- or we're predicting over time that there's the possibility that the percentage actually will increase.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then on IRIS, I know it's early days, I didn't really hear you bring it up in the comments, but can you just talk a little bit about interest levels for kidney and liver and how we should think about the expanded use of that going forward?
Gary Guthart: I think the interest from the forward-leaning surgeons is very high. I think, in general, people are looking out seeing additional access to data. IRIS, just a reminder for everybody, is the integration of preoperative imaging, 3D imaging into a case in real-time. We're not in the clinic yet. We do have our 510(k) clearance. We're working through agreements with first customers. We don't expect revenue this year.  I think, directionally, there's quite a lot of support. I think part of what we want to develop in the market as we go forward are use cases and really getting the value statement for them in terms of what it drives, either accuracy or efficiency or both. Early response is great, but these things take a little time to develop and to develop the evidence base that goes behind it.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
David Lewis: A couple of questions here. I'll start with Gary. Gary, last year, procedures began to inflect from a mentor perspective and they still remain pretty strong. As you think about the next inflection for procedure growth, I mean, do you think it's more likely that it comes from new systems? Obviously, SP, Ion creating this access, you've already talked about it on this call, or accessing new geographies, Japan and China. I notice you already mentioned in a comment that just a few systems in Japan -- sorry, in China, was able to drive some demand. So across those 3 buckets, Gary, systems, access, geographies, what is the most likely driver of the next wave of procedure inflection?
Gary Guthart: I think in the near term, access in core markets is going to be important. What's been nice here in the last few years is the procedure base has been building. So healthy double-digit growth rates in procedures, and absolute growth numbers are starting to become substantial and making sure that those surgeons who want access to the system have it has been important, and it's been one of the drivers for our increased flexibility and agility in capital acquisition models.  As you look at SP and Ion, both of those are interesting platforms that I think, over time, will expand the total available market for robotic systems and diagnostics in single-port or single-access surgery. They take some time to develop. And the speed with which they develop is, as I said in the script, paced by additional indications and manufacturing scale. Longer term, I think those things are exciting, but it will take some time to go through.  Geography, we've seen real successes but they take time. Japan has been a great success. They're doing a really nice job. But it is really heavy lifting to do all the things required to build market access, from partnering networks to training centers to the clinical evidence base to support additional adoption. So I think those things are important. We have invested in them and we'll continue to do so. So short answer, maybe not a perfect modeling answer but I'll leave that to you.
David Lewis: Okay. And then just maybe a follow-up for you, Gary, just trying to get a sense of thinking about the SP rollout and the Ion rollout, your Ion commentary was fairly consistent with the first quarter. If I think about the first 4 quarters of SP, obviously ex-ing out the manufacturing issues last quarter, do you see Ion rolling out from a system placement perspective in a similar fashion to SP? Is there a reason why it would be faster in the first four quarters of commercialization? Or slower?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I'd anticipate measured in these first 4 quarters of launch as we optimize our systems on our side and also gathering our data. After that, we'll see. I don't think I'd predict it one way or another for you. The indications in Ion, we feel pretty good about to get started. I think the size of that market is real, and so we'll see a year from now, I think, as to how fast we want to move. On SP, it has, I think, great long-term potential. It requires additional clearances, in the U.S. anyway, to keep moving and so we'll do that in sequence.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Amit Hazan with Citigroup.
Amit Hazan: Let me start with one on the quarter and just follow after that. So on the quarter, the I&A versus procedures, I&A was up 22%, procedures up 17%. That's the widest gap I can recall in a little while. You touched on it a bit, but maybe just a little bit more color. Is it that new and advanced instruments driving something that's sustainable? Or are there onetime things in there that we should consider?
Calvin Darling: Yes. I think, in general, we have seen increasing revenue, instrument accessory revenue per procedure. Obviously, there's variability by quarter based mostly on the timing of customer orders. But in general, we've been gradually increasing. And the biggest aspect of that has been increasing usage of the advanced instruments, from vessel sealing, the Vessel Sealer Extend we launched recently, now to stapling as well, and the 60-millimeter stapler we launched last year and are more fully available this year in the U.S. So I think that's been the biggest factor that's probably been more than offsetting most everything else, whether it's more procedures in general surgery, hernia repair and others that may be lower tool usage. So I think that's the biggest factor there.
Amit Hazan: And just a slightly longer-term question on flexible endoscopy with surgical instruments. One of your bigger future robotic competitors has been talking about this publicly now for the first time in just the past month or so. Can you talk to how much of a priority this is for Intuitive? What you can tell us about the opportunity from a robotic perspective?
Gary Guthart: Sure. In general, as we've described before, we like to think in platforms. And what I mean by that is if we can build some core technologies from advanced imaging to great precision to great software, then we can mix and match those core capabilities to pursue different endpoints clinically. And so you look at SP, SP is an exceptionally powerful system that brings together four instruments through a single access point. You look at Ion, and Ion has exquisite sensing and a flexible endoscopy or a flexible diagnostic platform. Over time, I think those two different sets of ingredients give us a lot of opportunity and optionality. And so I think those things are interesting and they could open for us additional clinical markets over the long term.  That said, product design is subtle, and architectural choices are really, really important. Doing it right, getting a great clinical outcome comes down to sub-millimeter precision and microsecond timings of these electronics. And as a result, we want to make sure that we really deliver on the things we put in the market, from SP to Ion. So we're not sprinting to go as broad as possible. We really want to make sure we deliver against the commitments we make and for the customers who purchase our products. There's a fair amount of history out there of companies that have failed to attend to the details and start strong and peter out. And so we're careful and thoughtful about it.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
Lawrence Biegelsen: First, could you talk about the strategic and financial implications of the Fiberoptics acquisition? And I had one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Sure. I'll speak to why we did it. This is a -- Schölly is a strong team and a supply chain partner that has been important for us over many years. Clearly, great imaging manufacturing capability, design capability and processing is a core part of surgery of the future and interventions of the future. As we've grown, we wanted to make sure that we can continue to invest in that space, both on the design side and on the manufacturing and production capability side. It's been a great partnership with that team. We respect them and have been very productive with them. And so that gives us additional optionality and agility going forward in a core part of our business. On more of deal specifics and logistics, I'll turn it over to Marshall.
Marshall Mohr: So we entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets and operations from Schölly for a cash consideration of approximately $100 million. The exact amount of the consideration and timing of the closing is subject to certain closing conditions. And so that will occur over the next future periods. And the employees will transfer after each of the closing events occurs.
Lawrence Biegelsen: And then, on Ion, we haven't heard you talk about the opportunity or timing outside the U.S. What's the status, particularly in China and rest of the world?
Gary Guthart: Yes. On the specifics on China, we are in discussions with China's regulatory agencies about how best to bring it to market and timing there. I don't have a definitive answer for you yet, but it's an active discussion. Clearly, we believe there are end-user opportunities and value, health care value to bring in China and in Europe and in other markets. And we'll take it in sequence. We think this is a powerful set of technologies and a powerful platform. We are still in the early days.  Our greatest organizational focus right now is on really understanding the technology and the use of it carefully. The early clinical results are great and they are differentiated relative to other products in the market, so far, in these early days. That's really important to us. We will focus there. And as we build strength and experience and scale, then it gives us a lot of opportunities to engage the rest of the world.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James.
John Hsu: This is John Hsu on for Larry. Maybe if we could start, without providing guidance for 2020, can you give us some high-level guideposts for how we should generally think about investment spend next year going into 2019? You obviously have a lot of products on your plate this year, but just any high-level color would be greatly appreciated.
Marshall Mohr: Well, we'll give you a better color when it comes to January about what's going to happen next year. But the things that we're investing in are not short-term investments. They take -- they occur over a long period. And so you should expect that spending will continue to -- continue on those and on other matters going forward. And as we grow the company, of course, there's an increased amount of support that's necessary to grow the company, particularly on the sales side in terms of personnel and commissions. And so I think spending will increase. I won't give you anything more specific than that until we get later in the year.
Gary Guthart: Maybe I'll just speak for our philosophy a little bit. We think the opportunity for improved performance and, therefore, opportunities for the business are substantial. And what paces us as to how we decide how much we'll invest and when is that which we think we can do with excellence. Generally speaking, we see more opportunity than we think we can pursue. We wind up saying no to some things that are probably good ideas but we don't know that we can perform them well. And so that's what balances our investment portfolio. And we'll continue to use that philosophy as we plan out 2020 and go forward.
John Hsu: Great. And then just on the balance sheet, you obviously have $5 billion-plus in cash, you bought back some stock in the quarter, you also did a tuck-in acquisition for imaging capabilities. Can you just remind us how you think about your capital deployment priorities at this point?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. The philosophy and approach to capital deployment hasn't really changed. But to remind you, we think about that cash obviously to operate the company. We're making investments in our future. We want cash. The market is volatile in terms of -- the environment is volatile in terms of tariffs and other things going on. We want to make sure we've got proper investments to be able to deal with those. And then, ultimately, we look for opportunities to buy back stock and return cash to shareholders.
John Hsu: Okay. Great. And then just -- I could sneak one last one in on the tax rate. I think you mentioned the medical device tax coming back in 2020. By my estimate, I think we're coming up with an impact of roughly $30 million. Is that a decent ballpark for how you're thinking about the impact of product gross margin in 2020?
Calvin Darling: Yes. When we're talking about medical device tax we were recognizing in the past, we charge that expense item to cost of sales. So it impacts our gross margin there. We saw an impact around 70 to 100 basis points then. And it's probably a similar kind of impact, should that be reenacted.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of JP McKim with Piper Jaffray.
Jonathan McKim: I wanted to ask one on just this push to -- on trade-ins and upgrading the installed base to Generation 4. I think, after the last quarter, I think, half the installed base was still older generation. And so can you give us an update on where that is today? And then just how -- strategically how important is that to you to get everyone on Gen 4 ahead of competition that, in theory, should come sometime next year or after that?
Calvin Darling: I'll give you the numbers and let Gary talk to the strategy. You heard on this call, it was another 38% of our system sales involved trade-ins this quarter. It's likely to continue to be a significant part of our capital sales in future periods. At this point in time, it is about 45% of our installed base of 5,270 systems that are Gen 3 and prior, mostly SIs.
Gary Guthart: We think it helps. I mean, as to the strategy, we think our customers appreciate it. Many customers now are multisystem owners, or across their integrated delivery network, they have systems at different hospitals where surgeons visit. So having consistency helps them. Gen 4 products have a greater access to advanced instruments and other technologies and are well appreciated. So in that sense, we think we can lean in and help those organizations go do it. There's a different set of regulatory clearances. In different countries around the world, there are different trade-in economics in each country. So as you think about the analysis, you think a little bit about which region and which country can move most quickly, and we work through that as well.
Jonathan McKim: Okay. And then, if I could ask one on just -- the comments you made on the general surgery dynamics with hernia and some of the others is tempering based on just law of large numbers. But the shift to bariatrics and some more on chole, I mean, the shift in turnaround on general surgery, what does that do for your instrument ASPs? Are they more advanced instruments as you shift to different procedures in general surgery?
Calvin Darling: Highly variable. You look at choles, those are lower revenue-per-procedure cases. If you look at bariatrics, it's the other side where a lot of staple pliers are used. So it's a highly variable landscape.
Gary Guthart: Bariatrics is in early innings. And as we start to optimize the instrument kit therein, we're seeing really pull from the market there. We haven't changed our priorities in the U.S. sales force with regard to general surgery. We continue to believe there is opportunity and value in, of course, hernia and colorectal procedures. The bariatric side are really customers coming to us and starting to move that along.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.
Richard Newitter: I have two and housekeeping. With the housekeeping, can you just quantify what the selling day headwind was, what your procedure growth would've been excluding the -- not the selling day, but some of the headwinds that you had described related to the holiday timing and whatnot? And then, Gary, I was wondering, with respect to the capacity issues just getting robot time, are there certain types of procedure mix cases or certain types of institutions where you can proactively get in front of those capacity issues to get there before they occur? And is there any kind of characteristic of the institution's procedure mix that specifically is leading to capacity constraints?
Calvin Darling: Yes. First, on the working day, really minor in the quarter. Not a big thing. We mentioned in the commentary, overall, maybe a 30-ish basis point impact on procedure volume, with a much larger portion attributable outside the U.S. due to the timing of Easter.
Gary Guthart: On the capacity side, as we've said in the past, our customer base doesn't -- one size does not fit all. Each institution runs with different operating cadences within their organization. So in some places, we see extremely efficient capital utilization. Really, a focused actuary approach where they have very high predictability and get a lot of procedures out of the system. We're delighted to support that. And we help to benchmark that and teach others as they need it.  We see other institutions that, for various reasons, are operating at lower capital capacity for some reasons that are quite good. Some may be teaching institutions, some may be institutions that take on the most complex comorbid patient sets where predictability of procedure duration is difficult. So you can imagine, if you're sharing a system between a thoracic surgeon who's performing lung cancer procedures and a general surgeon who's doing hernia repairs, the cadences and rhythms in scheduling are quite different and you're going to get less optimal scheduling. To the extent that we can have those conversations up front and help them optimize, we do. That's something we've been strengthening over time, so I think we can do better than we do today.
Richard Newitter: Great. If I get one more, just the China utilization pickup on just 8 systems placed under the quota, did that surprise you that it was able to translate into a pickup in volumes so quickly? I was always of the impression that you needed -- there was going to be a lag time to train institutions. If you could comment there.
Gary Guthart: I don't know if we were surprised. I'd say we were pleased. That tells you the level of commitment and motivation of those customers to make their investment productive. Last questioner, please.
Operator: Yes. The last question comes from the line of Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank.
Imron Zafar: First question is on Japan. I believe you noted some moderation in procedure growth there, but at the same time, we're still seeing some very strong capital equipment placement numbers this quarter. Can you just sort of give us some color on what's driving these placements? Is it more sort of greenfield robotics programs that are looking to get into presumably urology? Or is it the established customers wanting to get more into general surgery? In light of the sort of the less financial incentive that they have, I'm just wondering if there's any -- if the growth should continue to slow going forward in general surgery.
Marshall Mohr: It's a combination of greenfields, where you have hospitals that are positioning themselves to do the newer procedures that were approved for reimbursement last year. And there's still a trade-in cycle going on in Japan. Our distributor had sold SIs on leases, and as those leases are coming up -- are coming due, then we see customers wanting to upgrade to the newer technology.
Imron Zafar: Okay. And then we've heard some mention from some surgeons on some third parties that hospitals can ship instruments to their -- that are approaching the end of their useful life and that this limited useful life can be extended presumably via some sort of a software intervention or something. Is this something that you're seeing any impact from? Or is there any regulatory preclusion that would limit the ability for companies to do this kind of stuff?
Gary Guthart: On how good an idea is it, the people in reprocess like that are bound by the same regulatory framework that we are in terms of assuring the quality of that product and making sure it's not sold as an adulterated product, and they have to take on that burden and it is a sophisticated one. Calvin, I'll let you respond.
Calvin Darling: No. Yes. I think that's essentially it.
Gary Guthart: In terms of materiality of it.
Calvin Darling: Yes. And you look at our revenue per procedure, I mean, it's -- we've talked about that a little bit and I don't think we've seen any impact on that.
Gary Guthart: That was our last question. In closing, we believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute intervention. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better and more predicable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for the care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost to treat. We believe that accomplishing this aim takes the integration of 3 elements: first, a deep understanding of the human interactions across the continuum of care; second, smart and connected systems, imaging and instruments that augment care teams; and third, the ability to measure impact through analytic insights and translation of these insights into action driving positive change.  Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-18 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q1 2019 Earnings Release Call. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call maybe deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2019. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note, that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights; Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results; then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2019. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Let's first start -- this first quarter was a solid start to 2019 for Intuitive. Customer response to our products and services is healthy with continued growth in their use of da Vinci to deliver high-quality, minimally-invasive surgery to our broad base of patients. As I've said in the past, I believe that outstanding product design, robotics, advanced imaging and informatics are just starting to take their place in surgery and in acute interventions more broadly. We have a substantial opportunity and there is significant work to be done. Global procedure growth was strong at approximately 18% in the first quarter of 2019, progress of growth remained consistent with our trailing several quarters, with growth in general surgery accounting for strength in the United States. Growth in Japan continues to be healthy with strength in urology, gastrectomy and colorectal procedures. Growth in China met our expectations given constraints on capital placements. Placements of new systems in the quarter was strong with growth in total placements rising 27% from Q1 of 2018. Net of trade exam retirements, our da Vinci installed base again grew 13% over Q1 2018 to approximately 5,110. The mix of systems placements between our flagship Xi System and our value X system generally aligned with our strategy regionally. Trade-ins of earlier generation systems increased this quarter as customers pursued the features of our generation four systems and some hospitals seek to standardize. As we discussed on our previous earnings calls, customers aren't interested in leasing, including usage-based models. The proportion of systems placed under operating leases increased again from 29% in Q4 2018 to 33% in Q1 of this year. The increase in trade-ins, leasing and usage-based models aligns with our strategy in supporting customers. It allows them greater flexibility to have the right systems in the right care delivery environments. For the investor, it can make revenue modeling for systems harder to evaluate relative to prior quarters as trade-ins impact our reported ASP and leasing defers revenue to future quarters. Marshall will take you through greater detail later in the call. Turning to expenses, we described our plans for increased investment in 2019 as we launched new platforms, strengthened our computational capabilities and invest in projects that support future scale and provide leverage opportunities as we grow. Over the past year, we've seen our increased flexibility with customers catalyze growth, which in turn enables us to invest in manufacturing efficiencies that lower our costs. Our spending fell near the top end of the range of projections we shared with you last quarter, supported by procedure growth above the top end of our procedure guidance range. Financial highlights of our first quarter are as follows: procedures grew approximately 18% for the first quarter of last year; we placed 235 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 185 in the first quarter of 2018; our installed base again grew 13% from a year ago; revenue for the quarter was approximately $974 million, up 15%; pro forma gross profit margin was 71.2% compared to 71.6% in the first quarter last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $552 million, up 20%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $747 million, growing 20% over Q1 of 2018 and representing 77% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $362 million in the quarter, up 4% from the first quarter last year and pro forma net income was $312 million, up 9%. As you know, we measure our efforts by their ability to positively impact the quadruple aim: better outcomes, better patient experience, better care team experience, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. Real progress requires more than minimally invasive tools and more than digital technologies. These technologies are necessary, but not sufficient. We believe intelligent surgery takes the integration of three elements: first, a deep understanding of human interactions that inform holistic system design; second, the development of high-quality, smart and cloud-connected robotic imaging and instrument systems; and lastly, informatics and AI to deliver relevant validated insights. While we've made significant progress over our history, we believe continuous improvement is required, and we have deployed our investments toward these aims. We design instruments and accessories to enable repeatable high-quality surgeries that are efficient and cost-effective relating to total cost to treat. Our team is in the process of launching several sophisticated products in pursuit of the same, and customers are now adopting them broadly. Our 60-millimeter stapler is now in full launch and is used primarily in abdominal surgeries. Our second generation 45-millimeter stapler has recently received 510(k) clearance, incorporating several of the learnings from our 80-millimeter line. Surgeon response has been strong and adoption of our stapling line is encouraging. We also launched our third generation vessel sealer. It's adoption has likewise been strong. Turning to the systems, we are in our first phase launch of da Vinci SP. We installed 6 systems in Q1, constrained in the quarter by manufacturing availability and bringing our clinical installed base of SP to 21. Roughly 800 procedures have been performed today. Recall, we have two cleared indications for SP: urologic and transoral surgery. Surgeon and patient feedback have been positive for usability and patient experience in these early days of launch. Going forward, we expect continued progress in strengthening our production performance to support SP launch at scale. As we've described in the past, we are also pursuing additional clinical indications for SP and have engaged regulatory agencies regarding their requirements. The combination of additional indications for SP and production readiness at scale will pace the speed of SP commercial deployment. In flexible diagnostics, our Ion platform is focused on the need for definitive early diagnosis of suspicious lesions for lung cancer. Ion received FDA clearance in the first quarter with 510(k) clearance, we have initiated our next phase focused on clinical use, customer feedback and production optimization. First cases on the cleared system were performed at the end of Q1, and we plan a measured rollout this year. We do not anticipate material revenues from Ion in 2019. In our cloud computing and informatics efforts, we routinely deliver programmatic insights to customers using our systems, which have been smart and connected for the past decade. We received FDA clearance for our Auris augmented reality product in first quarter and anticipate first clinical use in 2019, focused on several high-volume da Vinci institutions that will lead clinical evaluation and analysis. We do not anticipate any revenue from Auris in 2019. In closing, our business fundamentals are strong and for the balance of the year, our focus remains in completing the tasks we set for ourselves: first, supporting adoption of da Vinci in general surgery and in key procedures in global markets; second, launching our SP and ION platforms; third, driving intelligent surgery innovation; and finally, supporting additional clinical and economic validation in our focused procedures and countries. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I'll describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my remarks. Our reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Key business metrics for the first quarter were as follows: first quarter 2019 procedures increased approximately 18% compared with the first quarter 2018 and decreased approximately 1% compared with last quarter; procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. First quarter system placements of 235 systems increased 27% compared with 185 systems last year and decreased from the 290 system placements in our seasonally stronger fourth quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems by 13% to approximately 5,110 systems, which is consistent with the fourth quarter and slightly higher than the 12.6% increase last year. Utilization of current clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system grew in the mid-single-digits. Our revenue overview is as follows: first quarter 2019 revenue was $974 million, an increase of 15% compared with $848 million for the first quarter of 2018, and a decrease of 7% compared with the seasonally stronger fourth quarter revenue of $1.047 billion. Instrument and accessory revenue of $552 million increased 20% compared with last year, which is higher than procedure growth, primarily reflecting increased use of our advanced instruments and customer buying patterns. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,960, an increase of 2% compared with the first quarter of 2018 and an increase of 4% compared with last quarter. Systems revenue for the first quarter 2019 was $248 million, an increase of 6% compared with the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 27% compared with last quarter. The variation between 6% systems revenue growth and the 27% system placements growth reflects greater proportion of operating leases, a greater proportion of system trade-ins, a greater proportion of X systems, a higher mix of distributor placements and volume-based discounts provided to customers purchasing multiple systems. We completed 78 operating lease transactions, representing 33% of total placements compared with 43 or 23% of total placements in the first quarter of 2018, and 84 or 29% of total placements last quarter. As of March 31, we have 423 operating leases outstanding and realized approximately $20 million of revenue related to these arrangements in the quarter compared with $10 million last year and $16 million last quarter. Operating leases create a future source of recurring revenue and reduce the volatility of system revenue. While the increased number of operating systems placed in the quarter dampens short-term revenue growth for the quarter in which they are placed. Operating leases include usage-based financing that we provide to certain experienced hospitals. We believe that our leasing alternatives align with customer objectives and have enabled faster market adoption. Relative to systems purchased over the lease period, we earn a small premium, reflecting the time value of money and in the case of usage-based arrangements, the risk that those systems may not achieve anticipated usage levels. The proportion of these types of arrangements could increase long term and will be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. 36% of the current quarter system placements involved trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on our fourth-generation technology. This is an increase in the proportion of trade-ins compared to 31% in the first quarter of 2018 and 28% last quarter. Trade-in activity can be lumpy and difficult to predict. 67% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xis. 25% were da Vinci X systems compared with 73% da Vinci Xis and 18% da Vinci Xs last quarter. Six of the systems placed were SP systems. Our rollout of the SP surgical system is measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. As mentioned by Gary, SP production was constrained in the first quarter. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts was approximately $1.31 million compared with $1.49 million last year and $1.46 million last quarter. The changes compared with prior periods primarily reflect a greater portion of trade-in transactions, volume-based incentives providing customers purchasing multiple systems, a greater proportion of x systems and higher proportion of distributor sales. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. OUS procedures grew approximately 21% compared with the first quarter of 2018 and increased 6% compared with last quarter. First quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $282 million increased 3% compared with the first quarter of 2018 and decreased 8% compared with last quarter. The 3% year-over-year revenue growth primarily reflects a greater proportion of X systems, a higher mix of distributor arrangements, and a greater proportion of operating leases. Outside the U.S., we placed 81 systems in the first quarter compared with 73 in the first quarter of 2018 and 115 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 49 into Europe, 13 into Japan, 8 into Brazil and 3 into China. 36 or 44% of the systems placed in the first quarter were X systems compared with 19% last year and 30% last quarter. 11 of the system placements were operating leases compared with one last year and 15 last quarter. Placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government limitation. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 71.2% compared with 71.6% for the first quarter of 2018 and 71.8% last quarter. The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2018 and last quarter primarily reflects lower system ASPs and a higher mix of advanced instruments, partially offset by improvements in manufacturing efficiency. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency. Pro forma operating expenses increased 27% compared with the first quarter of 2018 and decreased 2% compared with last quarter. Fourth quarter 2018 operating expenses included a $25 million contribution to the newly formed Intuitive Foundation. Excluding the contribution to the foundation, pro forma operating expenses increased 5% compared with last quarter. In order of magnitude of increase, first quarter expenses reflect costs associated with expansion of our OUS markets, spending on our informatics capabilities and investment in our infrastructure in order to scale the business. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 19.8% compared with our expectations of 19% to 20%. Our tax rates will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income and changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our first quarter 2019 pro forma net income was $312 million or $2.61 per share compared with $288 million or $2.44 per share for the first quarter of 2018 and $353 million or $2.96 per share for the fourth quarter 2018. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $307 million or $2.56 per share for the first quarter of 2019, compared with GAAP net income of $288 million or $2.44 per share for the first quarter of 2018, and GAAP net income of $293 million or $2.45 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. It include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IP charges, and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.1 billion compared with $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase generally reflects cash generated from operations partially offset by investments in working capital and infrastructure. In the quarter, we grew inventory by approximately $60 million to $468 million, representing approximately 140 days of inventory. We continue to build inventory to address the growth in the business as well as mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supplier or other matters. With the growth in the business and our focus on efficiency and scale, we expect capital expenditures will increase to over $250 million in 2019. In January, our Board of Directors increased our stock buyback authorization to $2 billion. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance, and will update our outlook for 2019.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 18% compared to 15% during the first quarter of 2018 and 19% last quarter. Our Q1 procedure growth was driven by 17% growth in U.S. procedures and 21% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., Q1 procedure results were generally consistent with recent trends. Q1 growth was again driven by growth in U.S. general surgery, thoracic and benign gynecology procedures. In general surgery, first quarter hernia repair and colorectal procedure growth remained strong, while growth in other general surgery procedures such as cholecystectomy, bariatric, and liver and pancreatic cases also contributed to growth. First quarter U.S. gynecology continued to grow in the mid-single digits, driven by benign hysterectomy procedures. Our data continues to indicate an increasing proportion of overall gynecology procedures are being performed by gynecologic oncologist. In addition, our recently launched Vessel Sealer Extend instrument is increasingly being adopted by gynecologists. U.S. urology first quarter growth moderated a bit in Q1, driven by prostatectomy, which moved closer to the underlying incident rate for prostate cancer. As a mature procedure category, we believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. In other U.S. procedures, adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was, again, solid in the first quarter. First quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 21% compared with 18% for the first quarter 2018 and 24% last quarter. First quarter 2019 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology. Two weeks ago, we attended the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons or SAGES conference in Baltimore. SAGES is one of the largest general surgery meetings each year, attended by many of the world's leading general surgeons. We were encouraged by the emerging consensus view regarding the value of robotic-assisted approaches in general surgery procedures. Our booth was highly visited by surgeons interested in hands-on access to the full breadth of our generation four platform, including the da Vinci Xi, X and SP systems on the floor. And our advanced instrumentation, including the SureForm surgical stapler. The SAGES conference emphasizes clinical evidence, and I will share with you one of the e-posters presented at the event, analyzing real-world evidence. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. At this year's SAGES, Dr. Elizabeth Raskin from Loma Linda University, presented research titled: Reducing Variability and Outcomes, Conversion Rate Analysis of Minimally Invasive Sigmoidectomy. The study used the premier healthcare database, selecting data from institutions performing at least 100 laparoscopic-assisted or robotic-assisted sigmoidectomy cases between 2013 and 2015. Data for 8,821 patients from 75 hospitals were analyzed. The median conversion rate for minimally-invasive surgery to open surgery across the entire sample was 10.85%. The data was split between higher conversion rate hospitals above the median and lower conversion rate hospitals below the median.  Among patients from the higher conversion rate hospitals, the conversion rate for lab procedures was 18.41% compared to 11.33% robotic assisted. Among patients from lower conversion rate hospitals, the conversion rate for lab-assisted cases was 7.33% compared to 2.89% for the robotic cases. After adjusting for variables, the lap patients in the higher conversion rate hospitals had 75% more risk of converting to open approach. In the lower conversion group, laparoscopic approach was found to be 2.5x more likely to be converted to open compared to the robotic-assisted approach. While we are encouraged by the lower da Vinci conversion rates relative to laparoscopy, this study highlights that there is still significant remaining opportunity for surgeons to drive conversion rates meaningfully lower, which has the potential to improve outcomes and patient experience. Furthermore, as evidenced by the large gap between the higher and lower conversion rate hospitals, there remains significant opportunity to reduce the variability of outcomes across care teams. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2019, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2019 procedure growth within a range of 13% to 17%. We are now refining our estimate to the upper half of that range and estimate full year 2019 procedure growth of 15% to 17%. With respect to revenue, as we have mentioned previously, in mature markets, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure growth, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales revenue can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including U.S. healthcare policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Indeed, the impact of leasing, trade-in and product mix are reflected in our systems revenue results for Q1. While these factors are aligned with our strategy and positive business levers, the revenue result was lower than historical norms relative to the number of systems placed. Looking forward, we expect continued variation by quarter and we expect to continue to see meaningful proportions of capital placements involving trade-ins and/or these structured as operating leases. Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses. As Gary and Marshall outlined, we are expanding our investments in 2019. Given our results in the first quarter, we expect to grow pro forma 2019 operating expenses between 24% and 28% above 2018 levels compared to the 20% to 28% range forecast on our last call. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $320 million and $340 million in 2019 compared with $310 million to $340 million forecast on our last call. We continue to expect other income, which was comprised mostly of interest income to total between $120 million and $130 million in 2019. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2019 pro forma income tax rate to be between 19% and 20% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Tycho Peterson at JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Maybe I will start with bariatric. Obviously, a lot of excitement coming out of SAGES on the opportunity around bariatric. Gary, can you maybe just talk about the ramp and any infraction you're seeing between gastric bypass leads reviews? And if we think about the 180,000 niche procedures in the U.S., what do you think the adoption curve looks like over the next couple of years?
Gary Guthart: Well, thank you. For starters on bariatrics, we're excited about the long-term opportunity. And as you described, there's interest in all of the procedures' subcategories you've laid out. I'll, in a minute, turn it over to Calvin and speak a little bit about sizing. Where we are in terms of commercial focus, the commercial team is largely focused now on hernia and colorectal procedures. We see some early interest in bariatrics and we'll support that early interest, but we'll -- we'd like to make sure we satisfy the hernia markets and the colorectal markets we're in today, and then we'll pivot over time to support bariatrics more broadly. Calvin, you might speak to...
Calvin Darling: Yes. Tycho, you're right. I mean, the 180,000 is about right in aggregate, but there's a lot of different types of procedures within that category from sleeve gastrectomies, to the full bypasses, to the redo procedures you mentioned where I think there's and clear benefits to robotic approach for those complex surgeries. At this point in time, we've seen some very nice early-stage adoption. Obviously, based upon the patient benefits, but also, there's some pretty significant surgeon benefit as well from an ergonomic standpoint. So it's a nice foundation that's building and at this point, as Gary mentioned, we haven't focused the team entirely there.
Tycho Peterson: And then on China, Gary, you characterized the market as still being constrained. You only had kind of three systems this quarter. Can you talk about your latest thinking on the quota impact? And when you think things start to free up there a little bit?
Gary Guthart: Marshall, why don't you take us through that?
Marshall Mohr: Sure. So just to replay, the quota is 154 systems for robotic systems. That is a quota that is available to anybody that has approval to sell robotic systems. So if there were to be another company that came along that got approval through CFDA, they would also be able to share in that quota. The quota has been distributed to provinces. The provinces are responsible for identifying the specific hospitals. And then to the hospitals that have to launch a tendering process. All of that takes time and the tendering processes can take quite a bit of time. And in fact, if you replay back to when we got to 2015 -- or the 2013 quota, it took until near the end of 2015 when we saw majority of those systems get done. So what we had told you before was that you should plan on fewer systems early and more systems later. And in fact, the three systems that were done this quarter were not done within that quota. So we have not seen any systems from the quota yet.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then just last one on Ion. Now that you're out on the market, how do we think about the kind of data collection window here? And what time frame would we start to see some publications? Could we see some by the back half of the year? And then, can you maybe talk to your supply chain optimization efforts and where you are on that?
Gary Guthart: Sure. I think we'll be gathering two sets of data. Some are position preference and workflow data and the other is outcomes over time. I imagine you'll see various interim publications toward the end of the year. It will take some time to get the full set written and reviewed that may come after '19, but I think you'll see updates from key customers as we go through the year. In terms of manufacturing optimization, so far so good. A lot of this is really just starting to create the manufacturing process and lines to build things at a little bit bigger scale and incorporate learnings and update tolerances and other kinds of validation work. So far, so good. I think the team is doing a nice job there.
Operator: And next, we go to Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.
Robert Hopkins: Just two for me. First, Marshall, to start out, I just want to get your latest thinking on operating leases. Obviously, it's accelerated up to 33% replacements. I guess the way I'd ask the question is would you be surprised if that moved up to 50%? Or do you think we're kind of getting close to a top here with 1/3 of the placements?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. We introduced leasing and other alternatives, financing alternatives, a few years ago. And we did that in the face of what we thought would be customer demand. And in fact, we think it's played out quite well. And that we have been able to allow customers to expand more quickly their install base. I think -- so it's really customer driven, the demand. And having said that, if it were my choice, I'd find that leases and the alternatives that we're providing customers are favorable to us and that it creates a recurring revenue stream, eliminate some of the volatility of system placement revenue. And I think, in the long term, it will enhance any type of upgrade cycle that might come along. So it's hard for me to predict exactly how far it will go, but again, if it were my choice, I'd like to see it go further.
Robert Hopkins: But it doesn't -- it seems like it's going to go higher from here. I mean, it clearly seems like there's no momentum in that, and I don't think it's that big of a deal. I'm just curious to hear your thoughts as to where we might be headed.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. I've given you my thoughts.
Gary Guthart: Well, it's hard to predict what the anchor point is. Likely, a little more from here.
Robert Hopkins: Okay. And then, one last question, Gary. You guys -- or for Marshall, you spent at the high end of the guidance this quarter. And it was particularly, the R&D spend I think, was up 38%, now annualizing at roughly $400 million. I was just wondering if you could just go into a little more detail on where that incremental spending is going? And I know we talked about the last quarter but any incremental details on where that big uptick in R&D spending is going would be helpful.
Gary Guthart: Yes. It's a fair question. So first, just total spending in context. The bigger component of the increase was actually expanding our field teams outside the U.S. So on a percentage basis, R&D grew. On an absolute basis, it was actually investments in commercial teams and field teams in Asia that drove the biggest side. With breaking down the R&D, to answer your question, in kind of priority order, computational capability and informatics, both in the product and back in the office is the largest uptick, followed by ION, followed by Advanced Instrument investments, followed by Imaging investments. Those are the ones that are responsible for growth down that pathway. And we think we're on a front foot there and making progress where we are and we're putting those investments out to support our future growth. That's the rough priority order.
Operator: And next, we have David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
David Lewis: Just a couple of questions for me. And Marshall, I wanted to come back to this dynamic of systems mix more broadly. You gave a lot more detail on systems mix this quarter than we've heard in the last several quarters, Calvin highlighted this in guidance. So I think it's going to create this notion of something [indiscernible] cyclically, this is just a weird quarter or structurally, there is different dynamic we should be considering for 2019 and beyond. So can you just talk in more detail, you talked about trade-ins x distributors, volume based discounting. So it does seem like mix dynamics shifted more maturely this quarter than, perhaps, in the last 2 to 3 quarters. I wonder if you could just highlight what changed and what's driving some of those changes?
Marshall Mohr: Sure. So to be clear, there was a shift. You're right, that we've seen an increase in the trade-ins, the percentage of trade-ins. And as I said earlier, it was 36% compared to 28% a year ago. And what we're seeing is just customers wanting to avail themselves to the fourth-generation technology...
Gary Guthart: And standardize at multiple systems.
Marshall Mohr: And standardize portfolio. And then we've seen more multisystem deals, and some of that has to do with what Gary was just talking about, their desire to expand their base. And as they are doing that, they would rather deal with one set of I&A, one set of training protocol and so forth and so they standardize on the platform. So the two are somewhat intertwined. We also saw a greater proportion of X systems, and that's been kind of a volatile statistic, actually. If you go back in time since we introduced X, and it's jumped around a little bit. But indeed, we introduced X with the intention of being able to deliver a lower cost product to geographies where reimbursements are lower. And in fact, in Europe, we saw 45% of the systems sold were Xs, which is exactly the market we targeted for. So these are all things that we think are positive trends, and leasing as well as I spoke to earlier. But the confluence of them all this quarter did drive systems revenue to only grow 6% and also ASPs be a little lower. If you were looking out into the future for the rest of this year, it's more likely, given the trend in trade-ins and the trend in the multisystem arrangements that will be closer to, let's say, the ASPs we saw this quarter than we saw for the whole of last year. If you go back to last year, we were pretty much around $1.45 million on a consistent basis last year. And so that's where I think we are and where we're going.
David Lewis: I don't want to put words in your mouth, Marshall, but it sounds like this trade-in dynamics has been going for 6 to 8 quarters. That's sort of been there. The x mix number can move around quarter-by-quarter. So it sounds like the only incremental new piece of information is some of these larger system orders. Is that a fair characterization of what's probably the incremental new piece of information?
Marshall Mohr: True. Yes.
David Lewis: Okay. Very helpful. Just two more for me, and I'll jump back in queue. One, Gary, you mentioned some SP manufacturing constraints here in the first quarter? Are those resolved? And sort of what's the pace to resolve them? And then, maybe for Calvin, just -- there's been a lot of -- your channel dynamics around women's health, more broadly women's health, general surgery breast in your gynecological FDA letters. Any impact on the impacting underlying base targeted on either those two letters or channel disruption? Those two questions.
Gary Guthart: Okay. On the SP side, the manufacturing constraint was a mechanical thing, having to do with frictions and rails and the way these things pull together. I think the team has got it. I think we'll meet our SP shipment client for the year. So I think they're knocking it down. It's just a timing issue there. With regard, I'll start on the broader one. With regard to FDA environment as it relates to medical devices and on women's health, clearly, they're signaling a more conservative approach and are speaking about it broadly across the industry. With regard to Intuitive, that may change some future data requirements and it may introduce some uncertainty and timelines for indications of kind of the things we're interested in over time. With regard to what it looks like in the installed base and things like cyclical perplexity, Calvin, I'll turn that back to you.
Calvin Darling: Yes. And as it relates to the -- there actually -- the FDA action relates to the use of mesh intended for transvaginal or pelvic organ prolapse. There are actually various methods of medical management for pelvic organ prolapse including observation, history management and surgery. da Vinci sacrocolpopexy is a minimally invasive method of abdominal surgery, so not transvaginal. And so since our procedure is abdominal, we don't think that this action is going to negatively impact our sacrocolpopexy volumes. Last year, we did something like 15,000 to 20,000 cases in that category, and we were about 40% of the market.
Operator: And our next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
Lawrence Biegelsen: One for Gary, one for Marshall. I'll start with the one for Gary. Intuitive has launched a new system every, call it, 6 to 7 years. Do you expect to maintain that cadence? I think it's been about five years since you launched Xi. And what can you tell us about how you're thinking about enhancing Xi? And should we expect a low cost system, perhaps for the ASE setting? And I have one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: With regard to innovation cadence, we continue to be committed to innovation. On exact cadences, we won't predict timelines because it's uncertain based on what kind of technologies we're developing and based on the regulatory environment. But you can be assured that we are committed to bringing the market, things that help our customers solve their problems. With regard to the specific question of economics and price points, you can see our history -- historically, X and Xi, and what we've done there, but just frankly, we routinely assess and balance customer needs, the features that they're interested in to achieve their aims and the price points, and we explore and invent broadly. We don't dispose what our specific plans are or timing for competitive reasons.
Lawrence Biegelsen: Understood. And Marshall, based on your guidance for procedure growth and OpEx growth in 2019, you're operating margin will likely decline. So how do you want investors to think about your operating margin beyond 2019, especially in 2020, when we could start to see new competition?
Marshall Mohr: Sure. We haven't provided guidance beyond this year. And I think what we said at the beginning of this year was you would see a decline in our operating margins, given the level of increased spending that we were going to embark on. Calvin gave you the guidance for increased operating spending. As you know, it did not change from our previous guidance. So I think that's all I really have to say about that.
Gary Guthart: Yes. I'd add something. I think as we look out, the opportunity for improvement in acute interventions in surgery with the kinds of things we do, robotics, informatics, imaging, advanced imaging, we think it's substantial. And as a result, we take a long-term view. We think these are multiyear developments, multiyear investments, but ultimately, the size of that opportunity is quite large. And as a result, we try not to tune it perfectly quarter by quarter or year by year, but really, look over the very long term.
Operator: Next, we will go to Amit Hazan with Citigroup.
Amit Hazan: Let me start with procedures for the quarter. Just big picture, it looked to us like a state of comp-adjusted slowdown in growth in the U.S. and OUS. And I'm just wondering, I want to make sure we're not missing anything, but is there anything to call out that was off trend? I heard you say prostate, we got that one, but if there's any other headwinds that you saw in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, that would have kind of driven a slight slowdown. Is there anything there at all?
Gary Guthart: No. I think the comment is pretty much reflective that we were on trend in most of the major growth drivers in general surgery and continuation of what we've seen before. And you can look at the Q1 comp, but then another thing to look at is workplace. So we had one fewer operating day in the first quarter, just due to timing of weekends is partially offset by Easter. So I think you overcame that a little bit too. So I don't think there's anything more to add to that.
Amit Hazan: Okay. Good. And then, secondly, I want to ask about the da Vinci Sis. So we spent some time with a few of your customers this quarter. And they basically told us that you guys are -- sent them a letter that you're sunsetting the da Vinci Si, and its instruments by 2024. And so I just want to see if we could, first of all, get a confirmation of that. And also, some context for how many Sis are still out there and how you'd expect it to play out in terms of the replacement cycle?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I'll let Calvin speak to the number of Sis that are out there. Indeed, we did put a letter out. The letter really talked about discontinuation of stapling in certain energy instruments, specifically. And that those would be coming to an end in 2020. We also indicated that we would discontinue annual service pricing in 2025. The -- having said that, we're committed to supporting Si. We'll continue to deliver instruments and accessories even beyond the end date of 2024. And we will even provide services beyond 2024, just not in the form of annual service, but rather, in the form of time and materials.
Calvin Darling: Yes. In terms of the installed base, we just turned the -- crossed the line here this quarter. The slight majority are now da Vinci Xi systems. But still, nearly half are Si and previous models. And we talked a lot about trade-in cycle and the impact in a number of trade-ins so there's still a significant number of Si and previous out there.
Operator: Next, we have JP McKim with Piper Jaffray.
Jonathan McKim: I wanted to ask one on SP. I think you said there was around 800 procedures performed in that platform to date. Maybe if you could just talk about whether those were procedures that would've been done robotically previously? Or if it is expanding the market a little bit? And then maybe your thought on other indications this year, and some rough timing around when those could happen.
Gary Guthart: Thanks for the question. The bulk of the procedures so far were in urology would likely have been done robotically anyway. Indication -- the additional indication we got in transoral robotic surgery was relatively recent. That will grow in time. That will likely be a small expansion relative to what's being done robotically. The next likely procedure for us to pursue is a colorectal indication. That will not occur in 2019. We will do a lot of the work, but I do not participate an additional clearance in '19 for colorectal, but it's likely next on deck that we expect to be more expansive than substituting.
Jonathan McKim: That's helpful. And there's clearly a push to get everything under the fourth generation, just in terms of the program you talked about earlier. But maybe, if you could talk about strategically, how important that is for you as a company either just to standardize manufacturing more? Or ahead of competition to get more and more customers standardized on this fourth-generation platform.
Gary Guthart: Our primary motivation is that the fourth gen is well optimized to the kinds of things our customers do. So our first motivation is we think it's beneficial for them, particularly things like advanced instruments and stapling and so on. We're at more mature products and those kind of advanced instruments. And in that sense, you see the trading numbers go up and some of the ASP conversations, we think we want to be aligned with our customers to both standardize and get the right access to the right technologies and the right place. We think that helps them. We think that helps us, and if we're helping both sides, we think that's good for our competitive position over time.
Operator: We go now to Larry Keusch with Raymond James.
Lawrence Keusch: Gary, just one relative to hernia. You obviously indicated that you still have the sales organization very much focused in the general surgical area on hernia and colorectal, and you're not ready yet to quite get going on bariatric yet with meaningful field support. So just on hernia itself since that remains a focal point, can you help us think a little bit sort of what inning we're in at this point as you look U.S.? And I guess the follow-on question is, what will it take to really start to drive general surgical procedures in Europe? Because again, still being dominated by urology.
Gary Guthart: Yes. I think in the hernia markets, I think we're in the end of the early innings is kind of where I'd put it. I think starting to enter more mainstream use. How far it goes, depends a little bit on clinical condition. As you know, not every hernia is the same, not every patient is the same in terms of comorbidities. So assessing total size of the market and applicability is always a bit of an estimate. But I don't think we're half-way done yet, and that's why we have our sales force focused the way it is.  Second half of the question, I'm sorry? Europe and urology. So on European side, we're starting to see some early interest in general surgery and visceral surgery. Certainly, on the more complex procedure side, we see interest in procedures that are done where the underlying causes cancer also has interest. There maybe an opportunity in benign general surgery as well. The economics maybe slightly different and that may require a slightly different adjustment from the company that made sure we satisfy that market. Early on, we have work to do to finish urology. We're not done yet. And then, we're looking at the next indications in the more complex side as the next step.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay. Perfect. And then, one quick one for Marshall, just on the operating leases. I know it's still early in the experience in terms of ramping those up. They did ramp relatively consistently through to last year, I guess, the 2Q was down a little bit, but should we think about any seasonality just in the operating lease percentages given what you know today?
Marshall Mohr: No. I don't think we've seen enough of a pattern to know whether there's any kind of seasonality to it. I suppose that there's the possibility that there's some seasonality associated with hospital budgeting cycles and so forth. But again, we haven't seen any particular patterns we'd point out at this point.
Operator: And next in queue, we have Richard Newitter at SVB Leerink.
Richard Newitter: I have two. First one for you, Gary. Just on -- I appreciate that maybe you're not as focused with the commercial focus to move into bariatrics with hernia and colorectal priorities now. But with the introduction of the 60-millimeter stapler, have you noticed any kind of inflection in the demand curve, at least, with respect to interest in bariatrics? And are we nearing that point where you would start to allocate the resources there? And then I have a follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Remember, in terms of sequencing to activate a market, there is optimizing the product set to get them there, there's helping build the partnering networks and the capacity for training and team training. So there's some pre-work, and then there's the building of the sales force competencies and support, customer base. So we're engaged in the pre-work. First, from the products and now into building the pathways and engaging those who will lead. So we're excited about it. I think there's real interest and there's real long-term opportunity and it's really just a question of timing. In terms of results, I wouldn't call anything out. One way or another, showing strength or weakness. I think we're really in a building capacity phase before we expect more out of the commercial team.
Richard Newitter: Okay. And just as we think about a higher proportion of systems getting placed under these flexible financing arrangements, minimum volume committed -- commit arrangements, I'm just curious, a straight operating lease model, one would've thought, hey, some of these systems maybe are more susceptible or the customers are more susceptible to a trialing phenomenon as competitors come into the market. But the more I hear you talk about these and the multisystem sales in these volume commitments, I'm wondering, does that just raise the switching costs as we think of a higher percentage of systems getting placed in there?
Gary Guthart: Well, first of all, when you say volume commitments, they are not volume commitments. They are targets that we establish, but we don't have a volume commitment per se. Second, I think there are costs to switch, of course, that go beyond the system itself, training surgeons and staff as well as protocols on how you set up the -- how you set up the OR, how you manage the product and how use the product and so I think those are barriers as well. As far switching costs associated with the system itself, you do run a risk with the some of the variations we're putting out there in financing that it may be easier for our customer to switch out. But we think that broadening the base now and getting the commitment of the surgeons and getting them trained so that we increase the barrier on that front is a better route to go.
Operator: And next, we have Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Craig Bijou: I wanted to ask on Japan. I appreciate the comment that procedural growth was still strong. But I wanted to see, is it -- are you still seeing some of the growth that you saw in the last couple of quarters? Just -- how should we think about where exactly or I guess, how strong that growth is with the new procedures?
Calvin Darling: Yes. We're full year now, right? We got clearance for those 12 new procedures April 1, 2018. And even after full year, it's still fairly early. And so we're focused on things like we were talking about, the training support, proctoring network, building a solid foundation of surgeons, the OR teams and really emphasizing the clinical outcomes. We talked about, back in Q3 of '18, procedure growth moving above the 40% line in Japan, that continued in Q4. And in fact, here in Q1 of 2019, it kind of held onto that kind of rate of growth.
Craig Bijou: And maybe just a follow-up on Japan, I know you added 13 systems in the quarter, but maybe just help us get a sense for what the demand -- or I guess, system demand is. I know that -- I believe that utilization of the Japan systems was one of your lower geographic regions. So just maybe a little color there.
Gary Guthart: Yes. I think what we've said before and we're still on that same page is that, the systems are utilized poorly at this point and there is the opportunity to increase the number of procedures that can be done on them. However, the 12 procedures that were improved last year are not necessarily all done at the same hospitals so you've seen us sell systems because there are hospitals that do those procedures that were not doing prostatectomies or nephrectomies and now want to do robotic surgery. So it's hard for us to gauge exactly how much more -- how many more systems we can sell given the opportunity in front of us. The number of procedures being performed that had previously been approved, which was prostatectomy and nephrectomy was around 25,000 to 30,000 and these additional 12 procedures was 200,000, although they were highly laparoscopically penetrated, and so it's also difficult to know how many of those will actually adopt or switch.
Operator: Our final question will come from Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank.
Imron Zafar: First, on U.S. general surgery, I'm curious if you could give us some insight on how much of the growth you're seeing is coming from higher penetration within your existing users versus new general surgeons embracing robotics?
Calvin Darling: Yes. You just look at what we're selling. The large majority of capital is -- are going into existing customers. They were expanding their programs and we're working with them as thoughtfully as we can with analytics and insights and expanding programs to build them out in the hospitals. So a large part of the remaining opportunity and procedures that are currently adopting are in the hospitals or hospital networks that we have established relationships. Yes. We still have some greenfield opportunities to be sure, but in terms of proportion, it's heavy on existing.
Gary Guthart: Question may have been asked from the point of surgeon themselves. More from a surgeon or newly trained surgeons and it's clearly a balanced mix of both.
Imron Zafar: Okay. And then, can you just talk about the long-term opportunity for a mastectomy? I know you have a clinical study ongoing -- or is getting underway. And is it fair to assume that that's more of an SP opportunity rather than the multiport?
Gary Guthart: Not ready to characterize anything yet. We know that there are some folks who are interested in it who are starting to work through what studies might look like, but we are not yet prepared to talk about what the long-term looks like there.
Imron Zafar: Okay. And then one just -- one last quick one for Marshall. There's been a pretty sizable increase in your headcount since the third quarter. I think it's up like 800 something. I assume some of that is just headcount accretion from some of your distributor acquisitions late last year, but can you just talk about what geographies those hires are targeting?
Marshall Mohr: The two greatest increases, one is what you characterize, which is that we took on distributor headcounts. So specifically, over the last year, we've added over 300 heads associated with our growth in Asia-Pacific. And the second area is really manufacturing headcount, and we bring manufacturing headcount in to -- on a temporary basis at first, and then we hire them in boluses. And in fact, we hired a bolus of them in the last six months.
Gary Guthart: Well, thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predicable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe that accomplishing the same takes the integration of three elements: first, a deep understanding of human interactions across the continuum of care; second, smart and connected systems imaging and instruments that augment care teams; and third, the ability to measure impact through analytical insights and translation of these insights into action that drives positive change. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T TeleConference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-24 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q4 2018 Earnings Release Call. Now at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Senior Director of Finance and Investor Relation, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead, sir.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical’s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 2, 2018 and 10-Q filed on October 22, 2018. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC’s website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section, under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today’s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results. Then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights, and provide our updated financial outlook for 2019. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you, Calvin. Entering 2019, our business is showing strength. In 2018 over 1 million surgeries were performed using da Vinci systems accompanied by approximately 1,500 peer-reviewed clinical journal articles. The total number of procedures performed since first launch exceeded 6 million and the total peer-reviewed clinical database continues over 16,000 articles. While these milestones represent a step forward, I believe that outstanding product design, robotics, advanced imaging and informatics are just starting to take their place in surgery and in acute interventions more broadly. Surgery and acute interventions are sophisticated interactions among highly trained professionals that have a common goal of delivering outstanding care to a patient in need, starting with a careful understanding of operating and interventional environments, engineers and interaction designers collaborate closely with physicians to develop smart connected devices with the goal of the Quadruple Aim. First decreasing complications, second, increasing patient satisfaction, third, increasing care team satisfaction and forth, improved efficiency and lowering of the total cost to treat. Considering our current da Vinci systems and the procedures in countries that are our focus today, we believe applicable procedures exceed 5 million annually. As we consider our new concepts coming to market, including but not limited to our da Vinci single port system, our advanced imaging technologies and our Ion flexible catheter system. The long-term total opportunity for our products to make a positive difference in physicians and their patients lives is greater still. Given the positive response of our customers and in pursuit of the substantial opportunity to improve surgery and intervention that lies ahead, we plan to accelerate some investments over the next several quarters. We’ll review our guidance on spend later in the call. Given our prerelease this month, I’ll be brief in summarizing our 2018 highlights. Global procedure growth was strong with approximately 19% growth in the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year. Growth in procedures was largely consistent through the year with United States showing particular strength in hernia repair, colorectal procedures and practice related general surgery procedures including cholecystectomy. Mature procedure growth in the United States including prostatectomy and hysterectomy was solid again in 2018, though we expect slowing in these mature procedures going forward in some countries. In Japan, procedures grew over 40% in the second half of 2018, in response to additional reimbursements granted in Q2. Aggregate European procedure performance was generally in line with our expectations again this quarter with particular strength in the UK and France. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. Our capital placement performance in 2018 was also strong, with growth in total placements rising 35% from 684 in 2017 to 926 in 2018. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci installed base grew 13% over 2017. The mix of system placements between our flagship Xi System and our value X System generally aligned with our strategy regionally. As we discussed on our last earnings call, customers are interested in leasing an alternative capital placement models. The proportion of the systems place under lease increased again in the quarter from 25% in Q3 of 2018 to 29% in Q4. Financial highlights of our fourth quarter results are as follows; revenue for the quarter was over $1 billion, up 17%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.8% compared to 72.4% in the fourth quarter last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $539 million, up 18%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $722 million, representing 69% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $412 million in the quarter, up 7% from the fourth quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $353 million, up 16%. We launched the Intuitive Foundation with an initial contribution of $25 million in the quarter. The Intuitive Foundation’s mission is to support clinical and technology research and acute interventions as well as philanthropy in the communities which we serve and in which we live. Financial highlights for the full year of 2018 results are as follows; revenue for the year was $3.7 billion, up 19%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.5% for the full year compared to 71.9% for 2017. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $2 billion, up 20%. Total recurring revenue in the year was $2.6 billion, representing 71% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $1.5 billion in the year, up 17% from 2017. And pro forma net income was $1.3 billion, up 23% with the difference in growth rate between operating profit and net income, largely driven by the 2017 Tax Act and interest income earned. Looking ahead, a review of clinical outcomes for complex surgery and acute interventions across large population still highlights a substantial need for improvement. We measure our efforts by their ability to positively impact the Quadruple Aim. Real progress requires more than minimally invasive tools and more than digital technologies. These technologies are necessary but not sufficient. We believe intelligence surgery takes the integration of three elements. First, a deep understanding of human interactions that informed holistic system design; second, the development of high quality smart and cloud connected robotic imaging and instrument systems; and lastly, informatics and AI to deliver relevant, validated insights. While we’ve made significant progress over our history, we believe continuous improvement is required and we've deployed our investments toward these aims. We’re bringing together several efforts in pursuit of our mission. We are early in our Phase 1 launch of da Vinci SP. We installed 15 systems in 2018 and a few hundred procedures have been performed to-date. Surgeon and patient feedback have been positive for usability and patient experience in these early days of launch. We submitted our 510(k) for our second indication, TransOral Robotic Surgery in Q4 of 2018 and are responding to FDA questions on this second indication. We're also working through supply chain optimization, as we begin to ramp up production for SP, in addition, in anticipation of additional clearances in broader launch. Our first step into flexible diagnostics Ion is nearing Phase 1 launch. We submitted our 510(k) in 2018 and have responded to FDA questions this month. We anticipate Phase 1 limited launch of Ion in 2019. Focus on the need for definitive early diagnosis of suspicious lesions for lung cancer. In instruments and accessories, we plan to broaden the launch of our SureForm 60-millimeter stapler for da Vinci in the first half of 2019. The 60-millimeter stapler is used primarily in abdominal surgeries including Bariatric surgery. Surgeon response has been encouraging and our team has performed well in establishing it supply chain. Over the past several years, we've been increasing our cloud computing and informatics capabilities. Today, we routinely deliver programmatic insights to customers using our systems, which have been smart and connected for the past decade. We believe there are opportunities to further enhance these capabilities. Our advanced imaging programs and augmented reality programs are making progress. We anticipate first clinical use of our augmented reality program in 2019. As described in our prerelease, we've also been increasing investments in building our business operations in countries important to our future. Our efforts in China will accelerate in 2019 with the da Vinci distribution arm of Fosun Pharma, Chindex joining our joint venture this quarter. Combined with the release of the next system quota and the clearance of da Vinci Xi in China, we will be accelerating investments to establish our base to serve China over the long term. In 2018, we also acquired our da Vinci business in India and Taiwan and anticipate strengthening our investments and presence over the next several quarters. We described the multi-year nature of these investments in our JPMorgan talk using Intuitive Japan as an example. Market development in country is an arduous multi-year process. It involves building a strong management team and company culture, establishing strong working relationships with surgical societies, policymakers, regulators, and key customers, as well as building training in proctoring capability along with a local clinical evidence base. As we bring these efforts together, we plan to accelerate our spend rate above our historical norms for the next several quarters. As described above, the increase in spend is driven primarily by funding and growth of our joint venture in China, the ramp of our informatics efforts, infrastructure to support our procedure growth, including manufacturing lines and facilities, and the launch of our new platforms. We pace the rate of investment not just by the opportunity for growth, which we believe is substantial, but by our ability to integrate talented staff and execute against our objectives. In closing, as we start 2019, our focus will be on first supporting adoption of da Vinci in general surgery and in key procedures and global markets. Second, launching our SP and Ion platforms; third, driving intelligent surgery innovation, and finally, supporting additional clinical and economic validation in our focus procedures and countries. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall to review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I'll describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP to (12:02) pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my script. Reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Consistent with our preliminary press release on January 9, fourth quarter 2018 revenue was $1.047 billion, an increase of 17% compared with $892 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 14% compared with third quarter revenue of $921 million. Fourth quarter 2018 procedures increased approximately 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, and increased approximately 11% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in U.S. in neurology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. Instrument and accessory revenue of $539 million increased 18% with last year, which is lower than procedure growth, reflecting approximately $6 million of INA repurchase from distributors in China and Taiwan, in conjunction with transactions to go direct in both geographies and customer buying patterns, partially offset by increased usage of our advanced instruments. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,890, a decrease of 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, and relatively unchanged compared with last quarter. Excluding the buyback of inventory from China and Taiwan instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was similar to last year. Systems revenue of $341 million increased 20% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting higher system placements and higher lease related revenue. We placed 290 systems in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 216 systems in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 231 systems last quarter. 84 operating lease transactions representing 29% of total placements were completed in the current quarter, compared with 40 or 19% of total placements in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 58 or 25% of total placements last quarter. Operating leases include some usage based financing that we provide certain large hospitals. We believe that these usage based financing alternatives align with customer objectives enabling faster market expansion. As of December 31, we have 350 operating leases outstanding. And we realized approximately $16 million of revenue related to these arrangements in the quarter. The proportion of these types of arrangements could increase in the long-term and will be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. 28% of the current system placements in bulk trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardized on our fourth-generation technology. This is approximately the same proportion as last quarter and last year. Trade-in activity can be lumpy and difficult to predict. 73% of the system placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xi’s and 18% were da Vinci X system compared with 68% da Vinci Xi’s and 28% da Vinci X's last quarter. 12 of the systems placed were SP systems. Our install base of da Vinci systems increased 13% year-over-year and our average system utilization grew in the mid single-digit range. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases, lease buyouts and revenue deferrals, was approximately $1.46 million, compared with $1.47 million last year, and $1.45 million last quarter. The change is compared with prior periods primarily reflects the mix of systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Fourth quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $307 million increased 24% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 25% compared with last quarter. OUS procedures grew approximately 24% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 10% compared with the third quarter. Outside U.S, we placed 115 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 86 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 75 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 55 into Europe, 31 into Japan, and 9 into Brazil. 35 of the 115 systems placed in the fourth quarter were X systems and 15 were operating leases. Placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. The pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 71.8% compared with 72.4% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 71.5% last quarter. The decrease compared with fourth quarter of 2017 primarily reflects product mix in costs associated with new products. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs in our ability to further reduce costs and improve manufacturing efficiency. Pro forma operating expenses increased 31% compared with the fourth quarter 2017 and increased 27% compared with last quarter. Fourth quarter 2018 operating expenses included a $25 million contribution to the newly formed Intuitive Foundation. The foundation is a charitable organization, aimed at improving patient outcome. It will donate to qualified non-profit academic organizations directed as surgeon training and education including fellowships, advanced clinical research and advanced robotics research. The $25 million will enable the foundation to make meaningful contributions over the next several years. Our pattern or future contributions will vary based on various factors, including the financial performance of the company and opportunities for the foundation to make meaningful contributions within its mission. Excluding the contribution to the foundation, pro forma operating expenses increased 21% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in fourth quarter expenses reflect; one, increased costs that fluctuate directly with revenue, including sales and corporate incentive compensation; two, costs we elected to accelerate including spend on infrastructure in order to scale the business; and three, investments that drive our future opportunity including costs associated with going direct in China, Taiwan, India, and cost of prototypes. We believed that we were early in our journey to expand minimally invasive surgery and feel the fundamentals in the businesses are strong. So, we’re accelerating our investment in selected areas while continuing to invest in key product areas including SP, Ion, Vision and advanced instruments. We will accelerate spending on our informatics capabilities, expansion of our OUS markets, including China, India, and Taiwan, and investments that enable us to scale the business, including expansion of an automation of manufacturing. We believe these are important investments. That said, we intend to control spending in headcount growth to that which we could manage well. This leads us to a broad estimate of operating expense increase of 20% to 28% in 2019. Some spending naturally fluctuates with revenue and procedures like sales, production expenses, in corporate incentive compensation, other spending is longer-term in nature and positions us for future growth; for example, SP, Ion and Imaging. We would target to spend the lower end of the 20% to 28% range at the bottom end of procedure growth guidance. We are investing with an eye towards long-term for the company and the market and as such don’t intend to modulate long-term investments in response to transient conditions. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20% compared with our expectations of 19% to 20%. Our tax rates will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our fourth quarter 2018 pro forma net income was $353 million or $2.96 per share compared with $305 million or $2.60 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $337 million or $2.83 per share for the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the Intuitive Foundation contribution, pro forma net income was $373 million or $3.13 per share. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $293 million, or $2.45 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with GAAP net loss of $32 million, or $0.28 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 and GAAP net income of $293 million, or $2.45 per share for the third quarter of 2018. The GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects the impact of the Tax Act, while the fourth quarter of 2018 includes the $25 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IP charges and legal settlements. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.8 billion, compared with $4.6 billion at September 30, 2018. The increase generally reflects cash generated from operations partially offset by investments in working capital and infrastructure. In the quarter, we grew inventory by approximately $40 million to $409 million, representing approximately four months of inventory. We continue to build inventory to address the growth in the business as well as mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supplier and other matters. With the growth in the business and our focus on efficiency and scale, we expect our capital expenditures. We increased over $250 million in 2019. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and have approximately $718 million remaining under the board buyback authorization. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Calvin, who go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2019.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was 19% compared to 17% during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 20% last quarter. Our Q4 procedure growth was driven by 18% growth in U.S. procedures and 24% growth in OUS markets. Overall procedure growth for the full year 2018 was approximately 18% compared to 16% in 2017 comprised of 17% growth in the U.S. and 22% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S, Q4 and full-year procedure results were consistent with recent trends. Q4 growth was again driven by growth in U.S. general surgery and thoracic procedures augmented by continued contributions from growth and mature gynecologic and urologic procedures. For the full year, approximately 753,000 procedures were performed in the U.S. for the full year, 2018 U.S. general surgery procedures increased approximately 32% to 325,000 procedures. Hernia repair, both ventral and inguinal continued to contribute the most incremental cases in the quarter and year with colorectal procedures continuing to show strong growth. Growth and practice based procedures including cholecystectomy and bariatric surgery increased as the year progressed. In U.S. gynecology, full-year 2018 year-over-year growth increased to mid-single digits driven by higher benign hysterectomy volumes. Fourth quarter 2018 U.S. gynecology procedure growth was slightly above the full-year growth rate, likely reflecting increasing seasonality in these benign procedures, partially offset by modest headwinds and hysterectomy for cancer, a mature category, where da Vinci surgery is standard of care. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see favorable surgical consolidation trends as our da Vinci surgery data indicate that practicing da Vinci surgeons performed more da Vinci hysterectomies and an increasing proportion of U.S. gynecology procedures are being performed by higher volume positions. Full-year 2018 U.S. urology procedures grew approximately 8%. Q4 2018 growth was at a rate largely consistent with the full-year results driven by prostatectomy volumes. As a mature procedure category, we believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, which has benefited from recent macro trends. In other U.S. procedures, adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was again solid during the fourth quarter. Full-year 2018, OUS procedures grew 22%, consistent overall with 23% growth in 2017. Q4 OUS procedure growth trends were mostly in line with the full-year results. Fourth quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 24% compared with 21% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 23% last quarter. Fourth quarter 2018 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology. Q4 procedure growth in Japan was consistent with Q3 at a rate over 40% as procedures were performed within the set of 12 additional procedures approved for reimbursement, effective April 1. Procedure growth in China again moderated in Q4 as da Vinci system capacity expansion was constrained by system quota requirements. As Gary mentioned, over 1500 peer-reviewed clinical articles regarding da Vinci surgery were published in 2018 and over 16,000 have been published to-date. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deemed to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. In December 2018, a manuscript was published by the journal of gastric cancer, titled clinical advantages of robotic gastrectomy for clinical stage one and two gastric cancer, a multi-institutional prospective single-arm study. This study was one of the largest multicenter prospective studies for gastric cancer, which included 330 patients across 15 institutions in Japan. This study was designed to show the safety, effectiveness, and economic efficiency of da Vinci surgery for gastric cancer, and was in support of the MHLW Senshin Iryo B process, which led to the recent addition of gastrectomy to reimburse status in Japan. The main hypothesis of the study was to demonstrate a reduction in morbidity associated with robotic surgery compared to laparoscopy. The hypothesis was confirmed as the results showed a reduction in the morbidity rate to 2.45% for robotic procedures compared to 6.4% for the historical lap control group, patient characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between the prospective arm, the robotic group, and the historical control, the laparoscopic group. Preoperative differences were noted in both groups as the robotic group contained more patients of younger age, but also contain more complex patients with higher comorbid conditions. The robotic arm had lower clinical staging while no differences were noted in pathological staging between the groups. In the directional analysis, the robotic-assisted cohort was noted to have significantly lower interoperative blood loss, shorter duration of hospital stay, nine days versus 13 days with comparable operative time. The authors of the study concluded that the significant reduction and morbidity might help demonstrate reduced total cost of care of da Vinci surgery to be likely the same amount as for laparoscopy. In conclusion, the robotic group reduced the morbidity rate when compared to the findings of the lap group. Robotic surgery might be safe, feasible, and effective for gastric cancer. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2019. Starting with procedures, as described in our announcement earlier this month, 2018 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 18% to roughly 1,037,000 procedures performed worldwide. As communicated previously during 2019, we anticipate full-year procedure growth within a range of 13% to 17%. We expect 2019 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside of the United States, where we are still in the early stages of adoption. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2019 as we have experienced in previous years with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. With respect to revenue as we have mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure growth, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales can vary substantially from period-to-period based upon many factors, including U.S. healthcare policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles, and competitive factors. Within this framework, we’d expect 2019 capital placement seasonality to generally follow historical patterns by quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2018, 84 of the 290 or 29% of the system shift were under operating leases. We expect that the proportion of systems placed via operating leases will vary from quarter-to-quarter and could trend up in the future. Turning to gross profit. Our full-year 2018 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.5%. In 2019, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will very quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses. As Gary and Marshall outlined, we will be following through on in expanding our investments in 2019. We expect to grow pro forma 2019 operating expenses between 20% and 28% above 2018 levels. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $310 million and $340 million in 2019 compared to $261 million in 2018. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $120 million and $130 million in 2019. With regard to income tax consistent with our 2018 results, we estimate our 2019 pro forma income tax rate to be between 19% and 20% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will be from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis: Good morning. Maybe I’ll start financial and then work to Gary for strategic. So, just Marshall and maybe a little bit for Gary as well, just sticky about the spending breakdown for 2019, two questions, then I’ll just do one follow-up. on financial pieces, Marshall, any sense of R&D relative to SG&A, we’re sort of assuming you continue to grow R&D at a similar rate of 2018 in the material step up and spending relative to my models more SG&A and maybe just sort of walk us through a couple of the components there in R&D and SG&A that are driving the majority of the spend. And then I had a quick follow-up for Gary.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. I think that the step up and spend is maybe slightly weighted towards SG&A, but pretty even across the categories, the elements of SG&A are as I discussed, the expansion OUS and the investments we’re making in China, India and Taiwan those are commercial organizations and that appears in SG&A. Of course, SG&A will grow a lot of costs that fluctuate with revenue such as sales compensation and incentive compensations flow through SG&A. However, in the R&D area, we will continue to invest in SP, Ion and Vision and advanced instruments. And then as I said, will be accelerating some of our investments in digital capabilities or informatics.
David Lewis: Okay. Very helpful, Marshall. And then Gary, there’s been some media reports about one of your competitors drawing insurance from a much larger company, and I’d say barriers to entry is perhaps the most common incoming question we get from investors. So, I wonder, if you could help us articulate, what is the Intuitive mode as you see it or investors asking the wrong question and they should be more focused on TAM expansion. Thanks so much.
Gary Guthart: I think a little bit of both that are going on I think in the competitive world. On the first side of our customers going to choose, I think customers appreciate choice and will expect it from us and from others. And in all things they’ll evaluate competitive offerings. For us, we focus a lot on understanding what the workflow environment is, understanding the total cost, not just the constituent cost of price of the system or price of the instruments and accessories is really total cost to use the product, stability, usability, supply chain stability all of those things I think are valued when people are putting a fair amount of their surgical volume onto a platform. And I think it’ll take some time for folks to fully absorb and understand that. And I think also there’s some nice effects about surgeons training surgeons. There’s a large install base of surgeons, they interact with each others through surgical societies. They proctor each other. And I think that that allows our compound cycle of learning that’s been effective. To the question of what does it do, as some of the other larger competitors declared their desire of enter. I do think it validates for the broader market, the things we believed for many years and have been investing towards for many years. So, I think it’s a signal to everybody that these technologies and approaches are going to be important to the future. That said, there are smart people in all these organizations and outside of our company and we’ll see, we have evaluated many of the competitive concepts that we see out there, often making them for ourselves and evaluating them over the years. We really make our decisions based on what we think the customer needs and as a forward look and as a result, I think we may be wrong about some of our decisions, but we’ve tried to be well informed about our decisions.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: Thanks very much for taking the questions. And I have sort of two similar lines of questioning here. First, just to follow up a little bit on the comments on spend in 2019. For 2018, there was a 17% increase; for 2019, you’re talking about at the midpoint of 24% increase. I mean that’s roughly $75 million, I was wondering if you could kind of lay out how much of that is the investment in China and Taiwan and going direct. And then also how would you just sort of characterize that incremental $75 million in the growth rate you’re experiencing this year. Is this more of kind of one-time increase in the growth of expenses or could this be sort of a growth rate that we would experience for another couple of years? Thank you.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. So I think, Bob, these are multi-year investments and as Gary referred to it in his script, if you go back and you look at sort of what we said, we did in Japan, the investments were made early on in it, but you continue to make those investments overtime to get to a point of where you might see a real return from them. And in the case of Japan, we’ve been investing in Japan for 10 years and we’re now seeing the fruits of that investment in terms of a 12 procedure reimbursement. So, I wouldn’t characterize these as a one-time event. I think we’ll continue to invest in some of those things for quite some time. As far as how this – you came up with $75 million, how the – how you would proportion the pieces, I think I pretty much laid it out for David, there’s a chunk of spending associated with the expansion OUS in China, India and Taiwan, that will – you’ll see that primarily in the SG&A line, but there’s an equal set of investments being made in terms of informatics as well as investments to scale the business investments in expansion in automation of the manufacturing group, so…
Bob Hopkins: Okay, I appreciate that. And then one for Gary. Just a question on competition, frame it just a little bit differently. J&J and Medtronic both continue to suggest that sometime late in 2020, they'll bring some sort of technology to the market in robotic form. That both suggest that they're going to have lower cost systems, they haven't given as much details. But in my view, both sort of implied that their systems will be geared towards converting lap focus surgeons to robotic platform. So my question to you is, I realize you don't comment much on your pipeline. But I was just curious if you could comment, do you see potential value in advancing lap through robotics? And is this a priority for Intuitive today?
Gary Guthart: I do believe that some advanced MIS surgeons are becoming increasingly open to the use of robotic surgery and intelligent surgery. And we see it today in the market. We see bariatric surgeons interested in our technologies, and that's a domain that is high laparoscopic penetration. So I believe there's an opportunity there. I would separate the idea of capital being the only thing to think about as an opportunity to pursue that that growing idea in advanced laparoscopy. And what I say is that I think physicians are going to balance multiple criteria. They’re going to look at total cost to treat. So the capital, the cost to service that capital, instruments and accessories, the outcomes that they get from it, efficiencies and human capital time or human labor time in the OR and they're going to balance that. And I think all of those are up for discussion when you think about trade-offs between advanced laparoscopy and intelligent surgery. We think there's an opportunity there. We will pursue that opportunity. When I hear folks kind of over rotate to just capital cost on systems, I kind of think about how excited are people to jump aboard, just good enough commercial airliner. For sure, if you're flying commercial airline, you want the lowest total cost per passenger mile, but you can get that a lot of different ways and cheapening the capital, maybe not the best way. We evaluate all of those elements, we have thought about them deeply and we've made investments to pursue what we think is the right leadership position there.
Bob Hopkins: Terrific. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tyco Pete, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tyco Pete: Thanks. I want to maybe just pick up where you left off on some of these new initiatives. You talked about the first clinical use case for augmented reality this year. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about commercializing that, where you see the key application areas? And then similarly on the informatics investments, can you talk a little bit about what you're hoping to accomplish there?
Gary Guthart: Sure. Those two are related, but we'll start with augmented reality or mixed reality and that's something we have been working on for some time. And the world has been interested in. The idea here is to use multiple sources of information preoperative CT scans or MRI scans, intraoperative other imaging like ultrasound or florescence imaging, molecular imaging. And combine them in ways that allow the surgeon or physician to see things differently. It is embedded in inherent in Ion already that some of that core capability is required. We're also bringing some of that core capability to our da Vinci systems. In the beginning it will be around preoperative imaging and some intraoperative imaging mixed together for the surgeon in real time. First, I'd expect first clinical uses this year and the beginnings of the study that go around that. I don't think it will be a meaningful revenue contributor in the near-term. But I think it's one of the things that can really change outcomes, efficiency and the procedure and outcomes now it remains to be proven. But, we're excited about it. That's one leg of our thoughts around informatics and you've heard us talk about this over the years from strengthening our cloud computing capabilities. Internet connected our systems a decade ago to a partnership and then an increased and closer investment with InTouch Health around routing of data quickly and low latency in real time to internal capabilities around managing data legs and providing for customers, offline processing that allows them to compare their programs and take advantage of some advances in machine learning. Those are the types of elements that we're bringing to bear. It's nice. We have a foothold, we have some brilliant scientists who are advancing and leading that cause. And we think we have discrete deliverable steps that we can do and then validate that will start bringing real value to the market.
Tyco Pete: And then I guess a follow-up on Ion, a couple of questions here. Any risk of timeline slipping with the government shutdown. I mean, now that you've submitted the 510(k)? And then should we expect additional clinical data to come out this year? And it sounds like for the gross margin commentary you're not expecting any real impact on negative impact on gross margins with the rollout. Can you confirm that?
Gary Guthart: Let me speak to the first two and I'll let Mark will speak to the last one on margins. There's always a risk that things slow down. We are in engaged contact with FDA and so far we're feeling pretty good about it. But I can't speak to what the long-term implications will be in terms of shutdown dynamics. In terms of clinical data, there'll be – if things proceed the way we hope, we’ll start collecting additional data as it comes out. In terms of ones that gets published, I think it will depend on the timing of the clearance and the speed with which some of the installs happened. We think that the demand pipeline for Ion looks really good. The scientific response to FDA's questions, we feel good about and the engineering team and supply chain team, bringing those early systems out looks really good too. So I'm really pleased with the internal teams’ performance and the setup of activities. With regard to margin impact, Marshall.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. Ion will be rolled out in a measured fashion to create a good foundation. And so the consequences of both on the revenue and the gross margin line will be very small.
Tyco Pete: Okay. And If I could just ask one last one on the cadence of placements in China. You're expecting – now that you've had a little bit of time to digest the quota, anything to think about in the first half of the year here?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. So the quota, just to recap for everybody, 154 systems, keep in mind that 154 systems is for surgical robots. If there were to be competitors that got their product approved in China. They would share in that quota. So it's not just quota for us. The quota has been released. However, there are tendering processes that the hospitals have to go through. Let me remind you, the last time we got a quota in 2013. Most of the systems were shipped near the end of 2015. So it took awhile. When I would say – and then finally, the other implication is that there is a 25% tariff on the robots that the Chinese have imposed. We think that there's high interest in robotics in China, so I don't know, what that 25% – how that 25% will affect to their desire to buy. What I would say is that the pattern of placements will be few in the first half and more near the end of quarter period, which is 2020.
Tyco Pete: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Well, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One on SP and one strategic question for you Gary, so on SP, I heard the commentary upfront about a few hundred procedures. Any themes you would highlight and remind us again of when we can expect the full launch?
Gary Guthart: With regard to early themes, the feedback has been that usability on the new platform is got a little – slightly different set of operating principles has been a positive surprise. Also the physician excitement about its ability to reach into small places and some of the flexibility at exhibits relative to setup and access has been a really positive surprise for us, which has been great. So that's been good. I think pacing demand looks really good. We are for sure supply constrained relative to demand and the pacing there will really be around a couple of things. One is we want to get our supply chain partners ready for real volumes. So we knocked down some of the issues that make it, take them awhile to produce things and we want to solve some of the manufacturing bottlenecks. The second thing is we want some of the additional indications that give our customers a little more flexibility with how they can use the product. So that'll pace it. We don't have a timeline yet for you on those two things. Both of them have a little bit of uncertainty in them. The FDA review of submissions being one and working down some of the technical bottlenecks is the other. I don't see any insurmountable technical challenges. I think it's just work. But so far so good and we're feeling like they're meeting the plan, we said.
Larry Biegelsen: That’s helpful. And Gary, as you know, we're seeing procedures in the U.S. moving to the outpatient in ASC settings. Do you believe your current Gen-4 offering and leasing option provide adequate terms for expansion into this environment? Thanks for taking the questions.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Thank you. You think about freestanding centers. There's kind of two dimensions on which you think about freestanding surgery centers. One of them are hospital owned outpatient departments. We are already well used and appreciated in those settings. So that's the physical structure is kind of the same and it's just how the ownership and operations are organized. Freestanding centers that are owned by group practices not hospital owned of a little bit different reimbursement in economics. We actually do see some of them starting to express interest and adopt robotics. I think that as we were saying earlier in the call, which procedures go there, depends both on the reimbursement of the procedure and the efficiencies with which products get used. And I think that for the right settings, Gen-4 can be quite strong.
Larry Biegelsen: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Amit Hazan, Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Well, thanks. Hey, good afternoon. Let me just start with a system or a unit growth question first, totally understanding the macro comments you made about that. But if I look at the data, look at the numbers, second year of accelerating growth, lots of drivers kind of seeming to be accelerating at the same time, trade-ins, operating leases, new products, procedure growth accelerating. So a lot's happening that's accelerating and have that very little, really nothing to tell me that growth trends are going to change that much. So help me out and tell me, outside of the macro issues, why would unit growth trends change much in 2019?
Calvin Darling: Yes, I mean regarding procedures, like we said in the prepared comments, it's really the procedure growth that drives demand for capital placement. So you mentioned a number of other factors, things like trade-ins, leasing programs, new product introductions. Things like that then can have an effect on the results either. But we talk about these things possibly fluctuating quarter-to-quarter and it comes down to just laying out your model and your frame of thought and working backwards from the install base and working at the installations. But there's a lot of the factors that you described are what's in the world. And mature procedures will a moderate growth for sure. We also know that in some cases, for example, there was a publication of couple of articles about the cervical cancer in New England Journal, and that can change procedure growth rates too, so and create a headwind. So there's a little bit of puts and takes here. In general, we are feeling like the business is strong and there’s strong momentum. But there are some things that will moderate as well.
Amit Hazan: And I have follow-up on the operating lease side and in the U.S. in particular, where obviously, I think it's up above 30% of units sold in 2018, I think it was 20% of unit sold for 2017. So we're starting to see kind of a trend line. And I do get what you're saying with volatility, but the question I think for us, especially, we start to model or try to model your system revenue number accurately for the year is how to think about that trend for 2019 and even 2020. It seems like you're focusing more on it, you're offering more programs and that trend line could continue. So we could kind of be towards the mid 30% to 40% range in the U.S in 2019. Are there other things that I should be considering for that why that wouldn't happen?
Calvin Darling: Well, it's been a successful program. I mean, it's been a way for us to offer hospitals an opportunity to expand their capacities without the initial capital investment. So it's been very successful. I'm not sure the numbers completely jive with what you said. We were 25% of placements in Q3 and 29% in Q4. We're under operating leases. So you saw that step-up quite a bit in the last couple of quarters. And so our comments are like, okay, we're here now, slightly to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter from where we ended the year. And then over the long-term, it could increase.
Gary Guthart: We believed that the operating leases are a good thing. We would, if having the choice place a system under an operating lease rather than sell the system, it reduces this fluctuation, like you said, it stabilizes sort of the revenue stream, if you will. It also in terms of if there were an upgrade cycle, what we've seen in studies is that the upgrade cycle is quicker when there's leases versus purchase product. So we think it's positive in a number of ways. However, it's up to customers. We really leave it to customers to decide what is best for them and we will fulfill that. And so it’s hard for us to predict exactly, where the customer will go and to what level will wind up with leases versus purchase.
Amit Hazan: Fair enough, guys. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Hi, good afternoon, Gary. Maybe turning back to the acquisition of your da Vinci business in India and Taiwan again. I heard you clearly; these are long-term investments that will take a long time to play out. I’d be curious to hear more about your thoughts about the relative size of the opportunities in India and Taiwan. Is this sort of, you mentioned Japan as a proxy a little bit, but Indian and Taiwan match up with China and Japan is in terms of magnitude, I mean, I assume you must think the opportunity there is significant. Just maybe help us think about that and frame it for us?
Gary Guthart: Clearly, the strategic motivation behind India and Taiwan are a little bit different. With regard to Taiwan, in terms of actual size, not going to be a huge part of the business. However, it’s an influential market, we – the distributor there that we were working with was, well built, and we think that it, it’s a group that does good surgery and has a good influence in the region. I think it’s important to serve that customer base well, but it’s not a massive financial impact by any means nor do we expect it to be. India has, I think, a fair amount of runway where it is today, and where it might be in a decade can be quite different. And so here, the idea is, it will take some time to build our capabilities in India, but we also think it’s an economy that’s been growing. There’s a strength in the surgical community in India both there and globally. And so it’s an important long-term market for us. We think that financially, of course, it can become a significant part of Intuitive’s business over the years. And the point of illustrating some of the Japanese example is that building a real presence and building the organization and the trust within the healthcare community in those markets takes time. So, if you want to get there in a decade and you better start, and that’s really what’s driven us in those two markets.
Rick Wise: Okay. Just as a follow-up and a different topic. You’ve highlighted, obviously some puts and takes in terms of growth, procedure growth, and you mentioned specifically slowing mature procedure growth in some countries. Maybe just expand on that is this just you’ve penetrated the market, and its flowing or is this something else going on? Maybe just give us a little more color there. Thanks so much.
Gary Guthart: In several countries, we are a substantial share of the surgical market, think of the United States prostatectomy or partial nephrectomy in the United States or hysterectomies for certain conditions. And as a result, we see that part really growing at the demographic trends rather than changing share of approach trends. And that’s true in the U.S., it’s true in some countries in Europe with regard to prostatectomy and some of the urologic procedures. In Japan, we’re already quite highly penetrated in prostatectomy and increasingly so in nephrectomy. So that that was the – what’s some of the detail or examples of what underlies the more general comment.
Rick Wise: Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Just one more questioner please.
Operator: And that question is from the line of Richard Newitter [Leerink Partners]. Please go ahead sir.
Richard Newitter: Hi, thank you. Wanted to start off on the percentage of operating leases and flexible financing arrangements, that’s clearly increasing as a percent of the total placements. Can you characterize for us what the utilization rate differences are on the systems that are getting placed into those types of contracts versus the rest of the installed base? I would imagine it’s higher, but can you quantify it at all?
Gary Guthart: We do quantify it. We monitor it closely. And there is not a market difference between what the utilization rates are on leases versus purchased product.
Richard Newitter: Okay. Thanks. And then just on the follow-up to the last question, Rick’s question. As we think about the low-end and the high-end of your 2019 procedure growth range, is there – is the slowing mature procedure growth commentary kind of meant to be throughout the entire range or is that contemplated at the low end instead of the high end?
Gary Guthart: Yes. Some level of moderation, particularly in the U.S. is a part of the trend and obviously, more moderation at the lower end and less moderation at the higher end. But the range will be largely, the range itself is largely effective. The biggest factor is going to be the breadth and pace of growth in U.S. general surgery, largest category now. Then the mature procedures and some other factors regarding growth in China, timing of placements of new systems and the pace of adoption of reimbursed procedures in Japan.
Richard Newitter: Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Well, thank you. Thank you for the questions. That was our last one. As we’ve said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls. Our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We’ve built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking to you again, in three months.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Financial Investor Relation, Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 02, 2018 and 10-Q filed on July 20, 2018. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section, under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results. Then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights, and provide our updated financial outlook for 2018. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. The third quarter of 2018 was a strong one for Intuitive with continued clinical adoption of our products and positive steps in product launches. As we mentioned last quarter, we believe acceptance of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, growth internationally and appreciation of our generation-four platform underpins our recent performance. Our team introduced sophisticated new products into the market this quarter as we seek to advance our goals of improving the quality of surgery and decreasing its variability. Global procedure growth was approximately 20% in the third quarter of 2018, compared with the third quarter of 2017, increasing modestly from our Q2 growth rate. Trends present in the first half of the year have continued with the United States showing particular strength in hernia repair, colorectal procedures, and practice related general surgery procedures, including cholecystectomy. Mature procedure growth in the United States, including prostatectomy and hysterectomy was solid again in the quarter. In Japan, procedures grew above 40% year-over-year, while our team is onboarding customer-facing staff and optimizing training logistics to support market growth. European procedure performance was generally in line with our expectations again this quarter with particular strength in the UK. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. Our capital placement performance in the third quarter was strong with growth in total placements over Q3 of 2017 rising 37% from 169 to 231 this quarter. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci installed base grew 13% over Q3 2017. The mix of system placements between our flagship Xi System and our value X System aligned with our strategy regionally. Capital placements have been historically lumpy and we anticipate variability in placements going forward. As we indicated on prior calls, we are seeing increased customer interest in alternative capital acquisition approaches, including leasing and usage-based models. This quarter, the proportion of new systems placed under lease increased over prior quarters. We believe it is in both our customer's interest and Intuitive’s to offer alternative financing models for qualified hospitals. We have expanded these programs accordingly. On the investment front, we are building our organization and making investments to deepen both our technological and regional capabilities. Fixed cost spending in the quarter was slightly lower than we planned, largely due to timing issues that we anticipate will catch up in future quarters. Use of our products has increased over the past year and we are in the early stages of several important product launches. Speaking directionally, we are investing to drive technology strength and to build operating and supply capability in support of our future growth. Financial highlights for our third quarter results were as follows; revenue for the quarter was $921 million, up 14%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.5% compared to 71.8% in the third quarter last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $486 million, up 21%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $660 million, representing 72% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $391 million in the quarter, up 12% from the third quarter of last year and pro forma net income was $337 million, up 4%, with the difference in growth rate between operating profit and net income largely driven by a one-time tax benefit in Q3 of 2017. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly. Delivery of substantive technology and service improvements are core to continued progress in surgery. We measure our innovations by their ability to positively impact outcomes in the hands of our customers to be used efficiently, while lowering the total cost of treatment per patient episode and for their positive impact on the experience of surgical patients and the professional who treat them. As we've said in the past, we design our product systems, instruments and software to work together seamlessly as an ecosystem that enables a holistic approach to a surgical procedure. We obtained FDA clearance for our da Vinci SP Surgical System for urologic surgical procedures in Q2 this year and we submitted our 510(k) application for transoral procedures for SP this quarter. We shipped 3 da Vinci SP Surgical Systems in the quarter all in the United States. These first access sites will focus on clinical data generation and customer feedback. Surgeon and team feedback from first cases has been extremely encouraging. That said, we are in the very early stages of a multi-year pathway for SP and our focus is on satisfying our early customers, expanding clinical indications, improving our processes and technologies, and further refining our supply chain. Our team is progressing to plan on Ion, our flexible robotics platform, initially targeted to address the acute need and diagnosis of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed and most lethal forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection is particularly important. As we announced last month, we submitted our 510(k) for its first indication. We showcased our Ion system at the CHEST conference this month. Feedback from physicians relative to existing in recently announced alternatives has been strongly supportive of our efforts. Our team is focused on working towards clearance in readying the product for its first phase of launch. We also initiated our early launch of our SureForm 60-millimeter stapler for use with our fourth generation systems this summer. Customer feedback has been encouraging at these early sites with hundreds of procedures performed today. The SureForm 60 brings the surgeons class-leading articulation and perception with computer measured and controlled stable firing. Collectively, our SureForm 60-millimeter stapler joints, our forced bipolar grasper and Vessel Sealer Extend advanced energy instrument to provide an optimized set of tools for general surgeons, particularly in hernia, bariatric and colorectal procedures. Our Vessel Sealer Extend launched into Q2 this year and our forced bipolar instrument launched in Q3. Feedback on these instruments has been outstanding. We anticipate expanding our rollout of SureForm 60 in 2019, broadening the set of tools available to general surgeons on our fourth generation platform. For the balance of 2018, our focus remains in completing the tasks we set for ourselves; first, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery; second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia; third, advancing our new platforms, imaging, advanced instruments, da Vinci SP and our Ion platform; and finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region. I’ll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I’ll describe the highlights of our performance on a GAAP and non-GAAP or pro forma basis. Our results are also posted to our website. Third quarter 2018 revenue of $921 million grew 14% compared with third quarter 2017 revenue of $808 million, and increased 1% compared with the second quarter of $909 million. Third quarter 2017 revenue included $21 million that had previously been deferred in connection with a customer trade-out program that the Company had offered certain first quarter 2017 customers. Excluding the $21 million, revenue grew 17%. Third quarter 2018 procedures increased approximately 20% compared with the third quarter of 2017, and were relatively flat compared with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. in neurology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. Instrument and Accessory revenue of $486 million increased 21% compared with last year, which is higher than procedure growth, reflecting increased usage of our advanced instruments. Instrument and Accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,900, an increase of 1% compared with the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of approximately 3% compared with last quarter. These increases primarily reflect increased advanced instrument usage in customer buying patterns. Systems revenue of $275 million increased 5% compared with the third quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting higher system placements and higher lease related revenue, partially offset by the recognition of $21 million of previously deferred systems revenue in the third quarter of 2017, a high number of system placements under operating lease arrangement in slightly lower ASPs. We placed 231 systems in the third quarter of 2018 compared with 169 systems in the third quarter of 2017 and 220 systems last quarter. 58 operating lease transactions representing 25% of total placements were completed in the current quarter compared with 20 or 12% of total placements in the third quarter of 2017 and 44 or 20% of total placements last quarter. We provide financing alternatives to hospitals that are well positioned in their markets, including some usage-based options as we believe these alternatives aligned with customer objectives enabling faster market expansion. As of September 30, we had 279 operating lease and usage-based arrangements outstanding with a net present value of their future revenue stream being approximately $250 million. We expect the proportion of these types of arrangements to increase long-term. 28% of current quarter system placements in bulk trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardized on our fourth-generation technology. This is an increase compared to 26% in the third quarter of 2017 and lower than the 34% trade-in rate realized last quarter. Trade-in activity can be lumpy and difficult to predict. 68% of systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xi and 28% were da Vinci X systems compared with 72% da Vinci Xis and 21% da Vinci Xs last quarter. Many of the X systems were placed with cost sensitive customers in Europe, and with customers in Japan where we obtained X approval this past May. Three of the systems placed in U.S. were ASP systems. Our install base of da Vinci systems increased 13% year-over-year and our average system utilization grew in the mid single-digit range. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases, lease buyout and revenue deferrals was approximately $1.45 million, compared with $1.47 million last year, and $1.42 million last quarter. The change is compared with prior periods primarily reflects the mix of X systems in trade-in transactions. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Third quarter revenue outside of the U.S. was $244 million increased 15% compared with the third quarter of 2017, and decreased 8% compared with last quarter. Compared with the prior year, instruments and accessories revenue increased $30 million or 34% and systems revenue decreased $5 million or 6%. The increase in instrument and accessory revenue relative to the prior year was primarily driven by procedure growth and customer buying patterns. The decrease in systems revenue was driven by an increase in number of operating leases, lower ASPs reflecting product mix, and the impact of trade-in transactions. The decrease in OUS revenue relative to the previous quarter reflect seasonality and was driven by a decrease in a number of systems placed, a higher number of system lease transactions and lower procedures partially offset by customer INA buying patterns. OUS procedures grew approximately 23% compared with the third quarter of 2017 and decreased 1% compared with the second quarter. Outside the U.S., we placed 75 systems in the third quarter compared with 62 in the third quarter of 2017, and 82 last quarter. Current quarter system replacements included 30 into Europe and 30 into Japan. 36 of the 75 systems placed in the third quarter were X systems. Placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption some markets are highly seasonable, reflecting budget cycles or vacation pattern, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2018 was 71.5% compared with 71.8% for the third quarter of 2017 and 71.1% last quarter. The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2017 primarily reflects lower system ASPs partially, offset by higher mix of INA. The increase compared with the last quarter primarily reflects higher system ASPs and higher production levels. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product cost and improve manufacturing efficiency. Pro forma operating expenses increased 16% compared with the third quarter of 2017, and increased 4% compared with last quarter. Overall, our spending was below our annual guidance, reflecting the timing of expenditures. We expect to continue to invest in key technologies and OUS market expansion and expect spending to increase next quarter and into 2019. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.5% compared with our expectations of 19.5% to 20.5%. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our third quarter 2017 pro forma tax rate of 9.7%, reflected $68 million of tax benefits associated with the expiration of statute of limitations. Our third quarter 2018 net income was $337 million or $2.83 per share compared with $325 million or $2.78 per share for the third quarter of 2017 and $327 million or $2.76 per share for the second quarter of 2018. Our third quarter 2017 net income benefited from the $21 million of deferred revenue net of costs and $68 million of tax benefits associated with the expiration of statutes to limitations or a total $0.68 per share. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $293 million or $2.45 per share for the third quarter of 2018, compared with GAAP net income of $299 million or $2.56 per share for the third quarter of 2017, and GAAP net income of $255 million or $2.15 per share for the second quarter of 2018. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website, it included excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IP charges and legal settlements. Note that the IRS has not issued final tax regulations associated with the recent U.S. Tax Legislation. Therefore, impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reflected in our results and our projection of future tax rates, represent our best estimates of the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and could change as tax regulations are finalized and further interpreted. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.6 billion, compared with $4.3 billion at June 30, 2018. The increase generally reflects cash generated from operations. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and have approximately $718 million remaining under the board buyback authorization. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure, performance and our outlook for 2018.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was 20% compared to 15% during the third quarter of 2017 and 18% last quarter. Our Q3 procedure growth was driven by 19% growth in U.S. procedures and 23% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., procedure performance across general surgery, gynecology and urology, all exceeded our expectations with Q3 year-over-year growth rates increasing modestly across these largest categories as they did in the second quarter. Q3 procedure performance was again driven by growth in general surgery led by hernia repair and colorectal procedures. Hernia repair both ventral and inguinal continue to contribute the most incremental cases in the quarter. Cholecystectomy, bariatric and other practice-based general surgery procedures all had strong growth in the third quarter. In U.S. gynecology, third quarter 2018 year-over-year growth increased to mid single-digits driven by higher benign hysterectomy volumes. In the third quarter, we continue to see favorable surgical consolidation trends as our da Vinci surgery data indicate that practicing da Vinci surgeons perform more da Vinci hysterectomies and an increasing proportion of U.S. gynecology procedures are being performed by higher volume physicians that specialize in complex benign and cancer surgery. Q3 U.S. urology procedures had growth rates consistent with 2017 and year-to-date 2018, driven by prostatectomy volumes. As a mature procedure category, we believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, which has benefited from recent macro trends. In other U.S. procedures, adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was again solid during the third quarter. Our overall U.S. procedure growth rate likely benefited from a weaker Q3 2017 comparison. Q3 OUS procedure growth trends were largely consistent with Q2. Third quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 23%, compared to 23% for the third quarter of 2017 and 22% last quarter. Third quarter 2018 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology. Procedure growth in Japan again accelerated as procedures were performed within the set of 12 additional procedures approved for reimbursement effective April 1. Procedure growth in China again moderated in Q3, as da Vinci system capacity expansion is constrained by system quota requirements, the most recent of which expired at the end of 2015. In Europe, procedure results vary by country with continued strength in the UK. Adoption of our products is ultimately based upon differentiated patient outcomes and procedure economics compared to alternative therapies. Intuitive supports the generation of high-quality clinical evidence through collaborative research initiatives. We work with clinicians, hospitals and medical and surgical societies to study da Vinci clinical outcomes, while maintaining a patient's first mindset. Intuitive is currently supporting comparative multi-center studies for several key procedures, including hernia repair, lobectomy and right colectomy. In hernia repair, we are supporting a perspective multi-center comparative study evaluating outcomes associated with open laparoscopic and robotic-assisted inguinal and incisional hernia repairs in up to 900 subjects. This study is designed to collect outcomes related to pain, quality of life and recurrence for up to three years post procedure. Capturing patients reported outcomes through direct electronic or phone follow-up. We are supporting a prospective comparative study for right colectomy, comparing outcomes associated with extracorporeal and intracorporeal anastomotic techniques and up to 300 subjects, collecting information related to patient quality of life parameters, including but not limited to gastrointestinal quality of life and incidence of incisional hernia rates. Intracorporeal anastomosis by the robotic approach may be amenable to more surgeon skill sets than the laparoscopic counterpart. Indeed, the degree of difficulty of the sutured laparoscopic anastomosis has limited wide application of this approach. In this year, where lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women in the United States, a gradual decline is noted in the percentage of lung cancer surgery performed by an open approach from 43% in 2015 to 31% in 2017. The literature supporting the use of minimally invasive approach both vast and robotic-assisted colobectomy is incrementally growing with the majority of them attributed to the treatment of early stage lung cancer. Intuitive is conducting a retrospective comparative multi-center lobectomy study evaluating both the short-term and long-term outcomes across both early stage and locally advanced lung cancer in up to 5,000 patients. You can find a full description of all of these studies on the clinical evidence page of our new website. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2018. Starting with procedures, on our last call we forecast full-year 2018 procedure growth within a range of 14.5% to 16.5%. We are now increasing our forecast and estimate full-year 2018 procedure growth of 17% to 18%. In regards to Q4 system placements, consistent with historical patterns, we anticipate seasonally strong fourth quarter system placements. However, we do expect some moderation from the 30% plus growth in system placements we’ve realized in recent quarters. Furthermore, we expect that the proportion of systems placed to be operating leases in Q4 will increase further from the 25% in Q3. Turning to gross profit, on our last call, we forecast our 2018 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71.5% of net revenue. We are now retiring the lower end of the range and expect pro forma gross profit margin to be between 70.5% and 71.5% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon product, regional, and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses, last quarter, we guided 2018 operating expense growth of between 16% and 18%. We are now adjusting this range lower and expect to grow 2018 operating expenses with a range of between 15.5% and 17% above 2017 levels. We are adjusting upwards our estimate for non-cash stock compensation expense to a range of between $255 million and $260 in 2018 compared $245 million to $255 million forecast on our last call. We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $70 million and $75 million in 2018. With regard to income tax, on our last call, we forecast our 2018 pro forma income tax rates to be between 19.5% and 20.5% a pretax income. We are now shifting our estimate slightly lower to a range between 19% and 20% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. We have a question from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Robert Hopkins: Thank you and good afternoon. I actually want to start if okay with a question on capital allocation. Obviously, the business trends are very strong right now. I think you mentioned that you've got $4.6 billion in cash and the authority to buyback stock. Maybe if okay, if you wouldn’t just mind commenting on why are you not buying back stock right now and does that suggest that potential for some M&A opportunities out there? Thank you.
Marshall Mohr: Hi, Bob, it’s Marshall. We've not modified our capital deployment priorities and so they're consistent with what we've said before. First, organic investment and substantial growth opportunities that are available to us. Second, acquiring technologies and talent that will ensure that we can accelerate our growth; and then third, using efficient long-term focus vehicles to return cash to shareholders. In that regard, we have done stock buybacks. You’ve seen us doing periodically. We do them opportunistically based on our assessment of the market. I think the market will continue to be volatile as it – has been recently, and as it provides opportunities to purchase at the right price. You will see us do something.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Gary, couple questions for me. I guess the first is, Marshall touched on this, but obviously leases suppressed revenue in the quarter, but net placement numbers in the U.S., were the best we’ve seen as well as system utilization, both those numbers are the best you’ve seen in years, and 20% procedure growth, obviously reflects another quarter, I think the third straight quarter momentum acceleration. I guess, thinking about these U.S. box and procedure trends, can you just walk us through some of the drivers that you're seeing specifically in the U.S. for these dynamics?
Gary Guthart: I think the procedure demand is of course the topline. And as we called out in the script, the sustained strength in some of the mature categories in urology and gynecology as well as general surgery really rising has been strong. I think the box placements in response to that increased procedure demand. From our perspective, we're happy to see utilization go up. We really view capital placements in mature markets as a way to enable the procedure market and so you're seeing that. Leases are then kind of fallout of that philosophy or hospitals that have good positions in their markets and are well run then we think giving them access where and when they need it at the terms that work for them and work for us helps facilitate the market and we've been willing to do that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Thanks. Well, looking like we're getting about one question each here, so I'm going to…
Gary Guthart: Yes. We'll give David a chance to jump back in queue a little later, but go ahead, sorry about that.
Amit Hazan: No problem, I’ll ask mine on Japan that was obviously some improved numbers in Japan that drawn procedures and installations, and so I'm just curious if that surprises you, that you got back the reimbursement, and if you could just give us some more on how you're seeing that market react and develop post the new reimbursement and whether it's sustainability of that growth that we’re seeing now look more realistic to you after this quarter? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: We're pleased with the progress in Japan. The – kind of the settle down growth rates are going to be a little bit hard to predict. Right now demand looks really good and I think the – it’s really the pipeline of activities from demand to clinical cases and up and running programs that’s the [limiting] step, some of that is training capacity and logistics, some of it is field support on our side, some of it is the depth of the surgeon proctoring network. Not all of the procedures that were reimbursed will adopt it, the same rates, nor will pursue them all at the same rate. And so there's a little bit of shakeout here as the priorities firm up. So far so good, but I really think there's a few quarters to go before this settles into a kind of a more predictable cadence. And if you have a follow-up, go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Sure. Yes, so I'm going to add – maybe ask about hiring. So from the numbers that you guys reported that’s obviously really strong, it's up to 50 to 100 headcount now, that’s about 700 increase so far this year. So maybe give some color on where the heavy areas are in which those heads are being allocated. And then how you're thinking about that headcount growth as we think about the next year or two? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Good question. Some of the headcount growth is – roughly tracks to the procedure momentum that we're seeing. So there's field support that's required. There's the production side of instruments and accessories and there's training resources that go into product training. And so those things are kind of ratable and we get a little leverage out of them, but we want to make sure that we support our customer really well. So that's where you see the bulk of the hiring. And as procedure growth goes, we expect a little leverage there, but not a ton. There are also new platforms coming. We talked about in the script, SP and Ion, and those are deep technology efforts, supply chain efforts and so, some of the heads have gone into support of that set of activities as we go. It may well be the limiting step for growth of the Company is really the onboarding capability of really good people. So we watch it really carefully and care about it.
Amit Hazan: You bet.
Gary Guthart: Thanks Amit.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. And our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I’ll ask a couple on some of the emerging procedures. On bariatric, I’m just wondering if you can comment on some of the market development efforts now that you've got the SureForm stapler out there. And how should we think about the sleeve gastrectomy versus bypass versus maybe other procedures? And then separately, I noticed you both Calvin and Gary talked about chole. I'm just wondering if that's coming back a little bit relative to what we’ve seen in the past.
Gary Guthart: On the bariatric front, long-term we're really enthusiastic about, and in the near-term, we're optimizing a few things. We are optimizing the product portfolio in terms of some of the instruments that I mentioned in the script. So the Vessel Seal Extend and the SureForm 60. We're still in our first phase launch, which is building capacity in the supply side as well as working through our customer preference feedback. That will start to expand into 2019 and it will be a measured launch. In part, to make sure that our supply capabilities match demand and in part, to make sure that our salesforce is well balanced in terms of supporting general surgery customers in hernia, which is growing nicely and colorectal, which is growing nicely, so that we have a balanced approach to the general surgery market. So I wouldn't overbuild the near-term on it. I think in the long-term, it looks quite good. With regard to resolution on the quite – kind of the clinical approach question you asked underneath, sleeve versus bypass, a little too soon for us to work through it. Clearly, there's a mix in the market. How that mix applies to robotics? I think that's a question for future quarters. On cholecystectomy, just touching that. We have seen strength in multi-port chole, a decline in Single-Site cholecystectomy made up for – more than made up for by strength in multi-port. For us, it's hard to know how much of that is a part of new general surgeons coming in versus how much of it is surgeons adopting or changing their practice pattern for patients that they think are well suited to robotics. There is clearly a mix of both, and separating those two in terms of intent is very hard. So we mentioned it because growth numbers have been substantive. The sustainability of that growth, we're not ready to call yet.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then if I can just ask one more clarification. Can you comment on the difference between the usage-based model and then operating lease for those systems that are kind of undertaking one of those?
Gary Guthart: Sure. Marshall?
Marshall Mohr: Sure. Operating leases, frankly, we structure these things to meet customer needs and operating leases come in various flavors, including that we will do your traditional four-year lease with a bargain buy-out at the end. We also do short-term rentals to get them over budget cycles. And again, so we're ultimately pretty flexible on the leasing programs. The usage based programs really are based on time and usage over a period and we've done that with a few hospitals as we said that are well positioned in the market and are serious robotic users.
Gary Guthart: And in terms of reporting, Tycho, we are including these alternative structures in with the operating leases, right. So they're all included in the overall operating lease number. They’re just – think of it as another form of operating lease.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Lawrence Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Two for me, I’ll just ask him upfront. Gary on the Q2 call you said hernia is moving to a different phase and it’s worth thinking through that phase? Can you elaborate that maybe you talked about some themes you're seeing in hernia? And then separately, obviously with the CHEST meeting at AATS, the two robotic bronchoscopy platforms got more Wall Street attention. Gary, the differences seem to be between the two systems, the camera capability and the size of the working channel. How would you compare and contrast the two systems with respect to those differences? Thanks for taking the questions.
Gary Guthart: Okay, I think the conversation we had last quarter was a kind of question of what inning are we in hernia, and I think we're still in the first half of the game, but out of the first couple of innings. And why do I say that? I think you're starting to see a fair amount of data that's being collected and things like registries that’s able to show clinical benefit. And we're seeing a fair amount of reorders from existing customers that does not appear that a lot of is just trailing. It looks like it’s – for those who have adopted their commitment to it appears to be pretty good. How deeply that goes into the total market in terms of what the total number of hernias out there is. We still are struggling a little bit understand what fraction of the total available market of hernias will settle into robotic-assisted surgery in terms of size of the herniation and bilateral versus unilateral inguinal hernia repair and so on some of the segments of the underlying market are not yet resolved. And so that's uncertain. We'll see as we go forward. But the data, so far and the surgeons taking this has been good. So that's what we were seeing last quarter, I think that that holds up this quarter. Turning to our Ion platform and as it relates to other products in the market. We made some decisions early on that that were really driven around, but we viewed as the clinical problem in pulmonology, which was the early detection of distal, meaning on the peripheral – on the further distant branches within the lung of suspicious lesions that are, give or take, a centimeter in size. And to do that, you need a really good sensing, which we did that was through our shape-sensing technology and some of the first partnering that acquisition and development of Luna sensor. And then it was depended strongly on the size of the catheter. So we make that decision based on understand the physiology of the lung. Understanding where those nodules were and hoping to understand what dimensional pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons really needed. That's what drove our architecture. We feel good about it. It’s possible technologically feasible to make a bigger catheter, making a bigger ones easier than making a smaller one, putting a permanent camera and if we needed to do that was all something that could be done and we chose not to. We chose to make it small and time will tell whether that was the right decision. I feel good about it. Last point, I'd make about the long space is that this is a space that has been looking at early diagnosis of lung cancer for some time and forward several commercial teams have gone in and promoted products several of which have disappointed. So I don't think it's a market that will move on what's said. I think it's a market that will move based on true capability and clinical evidence, and that's where our focus is. We feel good about where we are and we show what we think we can and I think that will determine success for us.
Lawrence Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. Okay. Our next question will come from Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Capital Markets please go have.
Brandon Henry: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Can you discuss any challenges you expect to face with the Ion rollout? And who will be selling these systems to pulmonologists? Will it be a separate salesforce or the existing Intuitive Salesforce? And then I have a follow-up?
Gary Guthart: I would anticipate the kinds of challenges that are related to that sort of complex product launches that we specialize in. So I think the early launches will be a couple of things it will be engaging with sites that have a long-term commitment to clinical progress, data collection that's associated with that clinical progress. Stabilizing supply chains or these kinds of technologies is non-trivial. It's hard and it's important. And so we will do that for Ion for sure and stable supply chain allows you to support a larger customer base and also get your costs in line, and so that is routinely an exercise we need to do, and then building your technology training pipelines and the proctoring networks that are required to really expand launch. So those things are all in front of us in terms of Ion. That’s the challenge. The good news is that we have a history of engaging those challenges, and I think we’ll work through. And I miss the second part of the question.
Brandon Henry: And then who's the salesforce, that will be the existing salesforce or we have to build out a completely new salesforce? And just how will that look?
Gary Guthart: Yes. We have a small specialty team within our existing force. Right now, that’s deeply trained in this space and linked to our other key account leadership and management, so they are deep where they need to be and connected where they need to be.
Brandon Henry: Okay. And then as a follow-up separately, could you provide an update on some of the opportunities to enhance Intuitive’s vision and informatics portfolio? And specifically, could you touch on the recent – health agreement and where the company is at with its augmented reality technology? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Sure. As we've said before for the last several years, we've increased our investments in imaging. I think imaging is important. I think it can really help change outcomes. And we do that routinely. We do it in the image sensors, in the endoscopes. We do it in the software that we use to process those images. In the way we tune images, we do it in our displays in our user interface. We are investing in molecules to expand our Firefly platform as you know. Molecules are just a way to increase the signal to noise for surgeons to detect structures they care about. Whether the things they want to take out or things they want to leave in and not disturb. Informatics works hand in hand with that, certainly in OR informatics. So we have built cloud capabilities over the years. As you know, we've been the Internet-of-Things for surgical robots for a decade now. Over 90% of our systems are Internet connected. So we have big data capabilities that we've built and we’ll continue to build. That allows us to do offline Informatics processing. And increasingly, we could use machine learning techniques and other things to do real-time capabilities. And of course over time that will give us the opportunity to do mixed reality or augmented reality features. How fast they come and where are the first markets are? We're not prepared to discuss yet. I think it's interesting and a long-term pathway. And so that's a step in that direction. We've known InTouch and have worked with them together for many years and this was a just the deepening of that relationship and the ability for us to build some real strength internally to Intuitive as we accelerate our cloud capability.
Brandon Henry: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Robert Hopkins: Thanks for letting me sneak back in. I just wanted to ask a question on Ion and flex catheter lung. Gary, how long will it take filing the approval of the product to generate the kind of efficacy data that you need to really drive broad adoption of the therapy?
Gary Guthart: Good question. I don't really know the answer right now. I think we'll get some early data that will be out of a few sites that will be quarters not years. There are multi-center studies that integrate that up and go through peer review cycle of course will be years not quarters. So I think you'll see as we have in the past, increasing cadence of publication just depending a little bit on what the complexity of the process.
Robert Hopkins: And then if demand for SP is really high, do you have the capacity to meet that demand? I mean, I know you want to go slow and focus on the long-term, but if demand is high, can you meet it?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I think the focus upfront is two things. One is to work on expanded indications site. As you know, SP is a platform technology from our point of view. We have the first set of indications in neurology we submitted for the second set. In TransOral Robotic Surgery, we think there are other indications that will be important. So the first thing is to really make sure that we're putting systems out that will help us develop those indications over time. So that is important to us. Second thing is that SP is amongst the most sophisticated products. I've ever been personally associated with, certainly that Intuitive has brought to market, and making sure that that we really understand and well characterized what our technologies are, and we have a really good stable supply chain before we go abroad is really important to us. My enthusiasm over the long-term and the customer enthusiasm for its capabilities is very good. But I think we'll be measured in this next set of quarters. As indications come and as our confidence builds then of course we can always accelerate supply chain capacity, but we're going to take it in steps.
Robert Hopkins: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
Gary Guthart: Hi David. Welcome back.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. The suspense is killing me. I don't know that my question will live up to the suspense. This is terrible. But Calvin had mentioned in the prepared remarks the systems moderation in the fourth quarter just is there anything fundamental behind that other than just harder comps and obviously the increase implications of higher leases?
Calvin Darling: Yes. I think it's really – I mentioned comparisons in the prepared remarks. We actually kind of crossed over that 30% growth in placements threshold last Q4. And so now, this is the first quarter we’re comparing against that kind of comparison. And so this is a little tougher, but like I said, we still expect seasonally strong fourth quarter.
David Lewis: And Gary just you've got a lot of questions on this call on SP and Ion. I wondered just – a lot investors are focused on these platforms. From a commercial perspective, if I compare SP and Ion, which one is going to require greater channel development? And how would you compare the near and long-term opportunity for system placements and revenue across these two systems? Thanks so much guys.
Gary Guthart: As I think about it, SP is more familiar customer base. I think it has really interesting core clinical capability, which is the ability to work in small spaces and parallel access. And I have been pleased with surgeon response which has been – now that I have a raw capability like this. There's some different approaches that maybe available to us and they're interested in developing the data that helps that. But I think that that’s – our visibility on that is probably a little better because we know the customer base quite well. As you look at Ion, I think Ion first is a diagnostic initial application that will have a little bit different set of dynamics for us as a company over time. I think the platform itself will have long legs. If you think about the ability to navigate tortuous pathways and inspect things using preoperative images which is kind of the core technology underneath. There are a lot of things that in the body could be interesting there. But it'll take some time to develop it and given that those are a different set of procedures that are different call points for us, that will take more development for us and frankly for the competitors in the space as that develops out. So that's a more nascent market. I think very interesting in long-term possibility. You kind of ask how bigger the total available markets for these two different things and how do we think about future market capacity. Those are highly uncertain. We of course, have models on them, we look at them. But as you know with us for years here that capability ultimately determines the total opportunity in the market and as capability is established with these things, we'll know better. As we get a little experience with them, we'll start to share with you our thoughts as the uncertainty starts to come down a little bit.
David Lewis: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Lawrence Keusch: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Gary just wanted to see if there are any observations or learnings from China over the last three months since the 2Q call?
Gary Guthart: Generally, no big change. As we've said before, we think demand in China for our products is real. And we're excited about it, and we think the long-term opportunity there is great. We think the macro trade environment is pressured, and we think that that pressure does not help us. And so incrementally, a little more headwinds on the micro side at the – on the ground side, we continue to make incremental progress and we keep working within the environment we have to work.
Lawrence Keusch: So I take it not a whole lot more visibility on just the process and in the quote itself.
Gary Guthart: Correct.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay. And then secondly, I know you obviously, choose your words carefully in the prepared comments and I think in the part around the 60-millimeter stapler you indicated that the sort of unusual feedback was encouraging. And I guess as I listened to that, I was wondering if that is meaning that look this is getting out there and people are starting to use it and it will take some time to you build the capabilities to get out there to drive more demand or does encouraging mean that perhaps you're seeing some things where you may actually need to tweak it a little bit before it's really ready for if you will prime time in 2019?
Gary Guthart: In terms of customer response has been quite good. The things that we're pacing – if you ask another way to answer your question is what's pacing launch? And there are really two things that are pacing us. One is, staplers are sophisticated devices to make and you want to make sure that as you expand your supply capacity that you're doing it in a very high quality level. So we're doing that. The second one is that, we don't want to overwhelm our salesforce with enormous amounts of new and different products simultaneously. We want to give them time to be deep and be able to address customer interest and demand as it happens. Those are really the two pacing items.
Lawrence Keusch: Okay, perfect. Thanks very much.
Operator: And we have a question from the line Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Hi, thank you. Just in light of the operating expense growth coming in a little bit later than kind of what you were forecasting is when we’re operating leverage this year clearly. I was wondering if you could offer some thoughts on maybe some of those projects you say were getting deferred or it's a timing issue and maybe some color on how we should be thinking about operating leverage potential in 2019 with respect to spending?
Gary Guthart: Sure. My preference would have been that we had spent our full allotment now rather than understand. On the other hand, I'd rather spend it wisely, and spend it because I have it. Most of the spending has to do with human capital bring on staff and we're doing well. But there's kind of a natural rate for bringing on staff and we'll do it where we are bringing on outstanding, people and integrating them well. It's not so much a specific product or project that is impacted and it's not so much that prototype dollars just rolled from one spot to another. There's a little bit of that, but that is the dominant effect. But dominant effect is really modulating the growth of headcount and that has to do with the pipelines for bringing in town.
Richard Newitter: Okay.
Gary Guthart: You asked a little bit of what does that imply for 2019 and as we said in our prepared remarks, we're seeing good procedure momentum in the marketplace and good demand and we want to make sure that we're able to meet that demand at high quality. We are not setting ourselves up to try to drive leverage in the 2019 model. Now we haven't finished all of that and we will do our spending models for 2019 into the next call. But directionally speaking, we want to make sure we can satisfy more demand here.
Richard Newitter: Okay, and just following up on one comment you made earlier. You said China as expected without increased capacity is moderating the growth in China continues to moderate. I'm just curious you can characterize that kind of the pace of moderation in growth that you're seeing there relative to kind of what you would have expected, is it not slowing as fast as you would have thought or is it in line with your expectations maybe just a little color there, so we can think about kind of how much of a headwind that might present going forward?
Gary Guthart: We continue to make progress on utilization on the systems that are in China. Last quarter, we talked about the China growth rate and procedures being fairly in line with the overall OUS growth rate, the low-20s. We're at a stage now or the moderation is at a moderate pace, if you will. And so you're gradually moving down from there I think.
Richard Newitter: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Isaac Ro: Good afternoon. Thank you. Two questions, one on equipment and one on investment in the business, on the first one I was curious with the Xi upgrade cycle if you need me qualify where you think we are in that process. You said to us you have still a fair amount of opportunity. And then secondly, on the expense side, Gary, you mentioned a little bit about the opportunities for training and I think that is a bit of a competitive advantage for you guys and so if you could maybe contrast how you think training for your pipeline will evolve not only for new applications, but also globally if you expand to other countries where medical practice is different. I’d be interested in sort of some of the things you're doing on the training side? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Sure. On the Xi upgrade cycle or the generation-four upgrade cycle, just roughly speaking, I don't know how many Si are out in the world, but give or take…
Marshall Mohr: 2,500.
Gary Guthart: So I don't know exactly what I would say it sort of depends when we're done. But there is an installed base of Si over 2,000, that’s an opportunity for us as we go forward. I think your implication behind your training question is exactly right. Building train capability is heavy lifting. It's a combination of human capital, people who are good at training and what that looks like instead of processes to build that are valid and you have validated. And then proctoring networks and proctoring networks are your customers, our customers who are deeply experienced and have teaching capability and willing to teach others, and so we develop those things. We have built a set of tools internally that allowed us to gain some efficiency and being able to spread that capability into new markets, and so that helps us. And we think that doing that well and doing that efficiently is something that does worth the investment and we have done so. What is its long-term competitive advantage? I don't know exactly. But I believe it's important for our customer and therefore important for the Company. Perhaps just one last question and then we will close here.
Operator: Thank you. Okay. So our last question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Vijay Kumar: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on the – really impressive procedure number. So maybe Gary or Marshall, just starting on the procedure number, the guidance is 2018, right? So when you think about next year number of factors at play, just how do you think the procedure number is going to look like? Should we be thinking of a really strong number? You made some comments on hernia. We're still at the very early stages of this hernia pick up. You have couple of new products coming in, so I'm just curious and how that number should trade-in. Just given lease, it looks like the percentage of lease is going to increase next year, right? So when we're thinking about modeling revenues for next year, if you could just explain the procedure how we should think about it? I think that would be extremely helpful. Thank you.
Calvin Darling: Yes. Hi Vijay, it’s Calvin. Obviously, we will give our specific procedure guidance on our next call in January, but we do anticipate the drivers of procedure growth and 2019 to be fairly consistent with what we saw this year in 2018 and last year in 2017, namely U.S. general surgery, U.S. thoracic surgery and OUS procedures, broadly speaking driving the lion's share of growth. U.S. general surgery is now our largest specialty, yet as we’re describing, we’re in still fairly early stages for hernia repair with ventral and inguinal colorectal procedures as well and even earlier stages for some of the broader practice space procedures. On the OUS side, we’re investing in growth in the larger European countries. Japan, China, Korea, OUS driving growth. And when we talk about what can lead to some of the variability and the potential range of growth, would be obviously the pace and breadth of that U.S. general surgery growth, U.S. mature procedure trends, any change in the China systems quota, positive or negative. And then in Japan, the pace of adoption on the 12 new reimbursed procedures. End of Q&A
Gary Guthart: All right. Well, thanks Calvin, thanks Vijay. That was our last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We've built our Company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. And I assure you, we remain committed to driving about a few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking to you again in three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us on the call today. Our second quarter of 2018 was a strong one in pursuit of our mission to improve the availability and quality of minimally invasive surgery. Customer use of our systems and procedures exceeded our expectations in the quarter with good performance in new system placements and increased system utilization at existing customer sites. We believe acceptance of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, growth internationally and appreciation of our generation-four platform by surgeons underpins our recent growth. That said we’re neither satisfied nor comfortable. There is substantial opportunity for improvement in surgery, and our customer base has demonstrated sustained interest in our new approaches to old problems. Global procedure growth was approximately 18% in the second quarter of 2018 compared with the second quarter of 2017, accelerating from our Q1 growth rate. Regionally, the United States showed particular strength with healthy growth in hernia repair and colorectal procedures. Mature procedure growth in the United States, including prostatectomy and hysterectomy, continue to top our expectations. Our first quarter aggregate procedure growth in Japan, after reimbursement listing, was in line with our expectations. European procedure growth was generally in line with our expectations with particular strength in the UK and mix performance elsewhere. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. Our capital placement performance in the second quarter of 2018 accelerated relative to 2017 with growth in total placements rising 33% from 166 to 220. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci install base grew 12% over Q2 of 2017. The mix of system placements between our flagship Xi systems, our [Value-X] system and refurbished X SI systems, align with our strategy regionally. Capital placements have historically been lumpy and we anticipate volatility in placements for the remainder of 2018. Turning to operating performance. Our teams execute its plan with manufacturing and quality cost meeting our goals, and average selling prices within our expected ranges. On the investment front, we are building our organization and making targeted infrastructure investments to deepen both our technological and regional capabilities. Fixed costs spending in the quarter was slightly lower than we anticipated, largely due to timing issues that we anticipate will catch up in the back half of the year. Highlights for our second quarter operating results are as follows; procedures grew approximately 18% over the second quarter of last year; we placed 220 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 166 in the second quarter of 2017; our install base grew 12% from a year ago; revenue for the quarter was $909 million, up 20%; pro forma gross profit margin was 71.1% compared to 71.4% in the second quarter last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $476 million, up 20%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $643 million, representing 71% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $389 million in the quarter, up 23% from the second quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was 327 million, up 42%. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly. Delivery of substantive technology and service improvements are core to continued progress in surgery. We measure our innovations by their ability to positively impact outcomes in the hands of our customers to be used efficiently, while lowering the total cost of treatment per patient episode and for their positive impact on the experience of surgical patients. With increased interest in da Vinci from general surgeons, we have added our 60 millimeter SureForm surgical stapler to our product portfolio, with 510 (K) clearance this month joining its prior CE Mark. Our second-generation cut and seal instrument, Vessel Sealer Extend, is in its first quarter of U.S. launch with outstanding customer feedback. And we have submitted our 510 (k) for enhanced grasper for hernia repair. As we've said in the past we design our product systems, instruments and software to work together seamlessly as an ecosystem, to enable a holistic approach to a surgical procedure. These latest instruments and software releases are optimized for our generation-four platform and general surgery. We obtained FDA clearance for our da Vinci SP surgical system for neurologic surgical procedures in Q2 this year, and we are finalizing our transoral clinical IDE for SP this quarter. We plan to launch the da Vinci SP surgical system in the United States in phases with first customer shipments expected to begin late Q3 or early Q4 this year. Our first access sites will focus on clinical data generation and customer feedback. Surgeon interest in SP is high and we believe SP to be a platform technology with potential application in a number of surgical specialties. Consistent with our history, we will engage surgeons and regulators in clinical assessments for new applications of SP and anticipate filing additional 510 (k) applications over the next couple of years. Our team is progressing to plan on our flexible robotics platform, initially targeted to address the acute need in diagnosis of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection is important. Feedback from physicians evaluating our technology relative to existing and recently announced alternatives remained strongly supportive of our efforts. We anticipate submitting our 510 (k) in this back half of 2018, and are working through final design validations and to bring up of our supply chain. As our approach to surgery has gained traction, organizations large and small, are hurrying to participate in the market. Their entry is an inevitable reaction to positive change in the operating room. Customers appreciate options from Intuitive and others, and we anticipate customers will evaluate alternative as they appear. At Intuitive, we are sharply focused on understanding our customers’ world and providing them with products and services they value highly. To take a simple example, our systems are available to start and able to complete cases with remarkable predictability, considering their use of a wide range of sophisticated technologies. This is a consequence of our holistic design and integration principles, the capability of our staff and our deep commitment to understanding the surgical team’s world. We believe this sets a high bar for new entrants in the eyes of the thousands of surgeons who use da Vinci weekly. For the balance of 2018, our focus remains in completing the tasks we set for ourselves; first, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery; second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia; third, advancing our new platforms, imaging, advanced instruments, da Vinci SP and our flexible catheter platform; and finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region. I’ll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I’ll describe the highlights of our performance on a GAAP and non-GAAP or pro forma basis. Our results are also posted on our Web site. Second quarter 2018 revenue of $909 million grew 20% compared with second quarter 2017 revenue of $759 million, and increased 7% compared with first quarter revenue of $848 million. The year-over-year revenue growth benefitted by approximately 100 basis points from the weaker dollar. Second quarter 2018 procedures increased approximately 18% compared with second quarter of 2017, and increased 8% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. in neurology worldwide. Kevin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. Instrument and accessory revenue of $476 million increased 20% compared with last year, which is higher than procedure growth, reflecting increased usage of our advanced instruments, partially offset by customer buying pattern. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,850, an increase of 1% compared with second quarter 2017 and a decrease of approximately 4% compared with last quarter. The increase compared with last year reflects increased advanced instrument usage and the impact of weaker dollar, partially offset by customer buying pattern. The decrease relative to last quarter primarily reflects customer buying patterns, partially offset by an increase in advanced instrument usage. Systems revenue of $277 million increased 25% compared with the second quarter 2017, primarily reflecting higher system placements and increased lease related revenue, partially offset by lower ASPs and an increased number of operating leases. We placed 220 systems in the second quarter 2018 compared with 166 systems in the second quarter of 2017, and 185 systems last quarter. 44 operating lease transactions, representing 20% of total placements, were completed in the current quarter compared with 16% of total placements in the second quarter of 2017 and 23% last quarter. While the number of leases is difficult to predict in the short-term, we expect the proportion of these types of arrangements to increase in the long-term. 34% of current quarter systems placements involve trade-ins, reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on our fourth-generation technology. This is an increase in the proportion of trade-in transactions compared to 20% in the second quarter of 2017 and 31% last quarter; however, trading activity to be lumpy and difficult to predict. 72% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xi and 21% were da Vinci X systems compared with 76% da Vinci Xis and 16% da Vinci Xs last quarter. Our install base of da Vinci systems increased 12% year-over-year and our average system utilization grew in the mid-single-digit range. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases, lease buyout and revenue deferrals was approximately $1.42 million, which is lower than $1.46 million last year, and $1.49 million in the first quarter. The decrease primarily reflects a higher mix of trade-in transactions. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Second quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $265 million increased 28% compared with the second quarter 2017, and decreased 4% compared with last quarter. The increase compared with the prior year reflects increased systems revenue of $25 million or 32% growth, and increased instruments and accessories revenue of $27 million or 31% growth. The increase in systems revenue was driven by an increase in the number of systems placed, partially offset by lower ASPs, reflecting an increase in the number of trade-in transactions. The increase in instrument accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth and customer buying pattern. The decrease in our OUS revenue relative to the previous quarter reflects the higher number of systems leased transactions, lower system ASPs reflecting increased trade-in transaction and customers buying patterns related to INA. OUS procedures grew approximately 22% compared with the second quarter of 2017. OUS procedures were positively impacted by the timing of holidays in 2018 compared to 2017. Outside the U.S., we placed 82 systems in the second quarter compared with 63 in the second quarter of 2017, and 73 in the first quarter. Current quarter system replacements included 39 into Europe, 13 into the Japan and nine into Australia. 30 of the 82 systems placed in the second quarter were X systems. Placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption some markets are highly seasonable, reflecting budget cycles or vacation pattern. And sales in the sub-markets are constrained by government regulations. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2018 was 71.1% compared with 71.4% for the second quarter of 2017 and 71.6% last quarter. The decreases primarily reflect lower system ASPs and revenue mix. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product cost and improve manufacturing efficiency. Pro forma operating expenses increased 14% compared with the second quarter of 2017, and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. The decrease relative to the first quarter primarily reflects the impact of payroll taxes. Overall, our spending was below our annual guidance, reflecting the timing of expenditures. We expect spending to increase in the last half of 2018 consistent with our guidance. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 19.7% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our second quarter 2018 pro forma net income was $327 million or $2.76 per share compared to $230 million or $2 per share for the second quarter of 2017, and $288 million or $2.44 per share for the first quarter of 2018. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $255 million or $2.15 per share for the second quarter of 2018 compared with GAAP net income of $223 million or $1.94 per share for the second quarter of 2017, and GAAP net income of $288 million or $2.44 per share for the first quarter of 2018. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our Web site, and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IT charges and legal settlements, including the previously announced second quarter 2018 charge of $42.5 million. Note that the IRS has not issued final tax regulations associated with the recent U.S. Tax Legislation. Therefore, impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reflected in our results and our projection of future tax rates represent our best estimates of the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and could change as tax regulations are finalized and further interpreted. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.3 billion compared with $4.1 billion at March 31, 2018. The increase reflects cash generated from operations of $220 million. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and have approximately $718 million remaining under board buyback authorization. In the quarter, we repatriated $1.4 billion of cash to the U.S. since the earnings have previously been taxed under the U.S. tax reform act of 2017, and there were effectively no foreign taxes assessed under repatriation. We’ve not changed our capital deployment strategy or plan. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2018.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 18% compared to 16% during the second quarter of 2017 and 15% last quarter. Our Q2 procedure growth was driven by 17% growth in U.S. procedures and 22% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., procedure performance across general surgery, gynecology and urology, all exceeded our expectations with Q2 year-over-year growth rates accelerating modestly across these largest categories. Q2 procedure performance was again driven by growth in general surgery. Hernia repair and colorectal procedures continued to lead the way as these categories, again, added the most incremental cases. As usage of da Vinci in the U.S. general surgery expands. Other general surgery procedures contributed larger numbers of incremental cases than previous quarters. In U.S. gynecology, second quarter 2018 growth was consistent with 2017 and Q1 2018 trends as procedures in this mature category grew modestly year-over-year with growth led by hysterectomy. We hypothesize our growth in gynecology to be driven by favorable surgical consolidation trends. As our da Vinci surgery data indicate, an increasing proportion of U.S. gynecology procedures are being performed by higher volume physicians that specialize in complex benign and cancer surgery. Q2 U.S. urology procedures also had growth rates consistent with 2017 and Q1 2018, driven by prostatectomy volumes. As a mature procedure category, we believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate market, which has benefited from recent macro trends. In U.S. other procedures, adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was again solid during the second quarter. Utilization of our da Vinci Xi systems and surgical staplers, which helped to optimize robotics thoracic procedures, has been increasing. Second quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 22% compared with 22% for the second quarter of 2017 and 18% last quarter. Second quarter 2018 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology. As expected, Q2 OUS procedure growth was higher than Q1, benefiting from more operating days, resulting from the timing of holidays, including Easter. Procedure growth in Japan accelerated as initial cases were performed within the set of 12 additional procedures approved for reimbursement effective April 1st. Procedure growth in China again moderated in Q2, as da Vinci system capacity expansion is constrained by system quota requirements, the most recent of which expired at the end of 2015. In Europe, procedure results vary by country with particular strength in the UK. Over the years, the discussions surrounding da Vinci surgery has been centered around the clinical patient benefits. In addition, we believe there is substantial opportunity to create surgeon value as well by improving the ergonomic characteristics of surgery. In 2017, in the annals of surgery, Dr. Chantal, CJ Alleblas, et al, published an analysis entitled, prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, MSTs, among surgeons perform minimally invasive surgery, a systemic review. This metastudy reviewed 35 articles, including over 7,000 surgeons. The authors characterize the risk factors associated with lab surgery to include, static body posture, repetitive upper extremity movements and forced exertion from adverse positions. Moreover, the workload has increased by the high level of task precision and time pressure. Physical demands defer between open and laparoscopic surgery and comparative studies have reported higher prevalences of physical complaints for laparoscopic surgeons. Recent studies report MSD prevalence rates of 73% to 88% among specialists in MIS. Relative to the general population, these numbers are excessively high. In their study, the authors found, a 74% prevalence of physical complaints among laparoscopic surgeons. However, the low response rates and the high inconsistency across studies leave some uncertainty, suggesting an actual prevalence of between 22% and 74%. Fatigue and MSDs impact cycle motor performance. Therefore, these results warrant further investigation. While pain ratings are subjective, we think there is opportunity to improve ergonomics for surgeons. With our recent bariatric surgery indication and SureForm 60 millimeter stapler 510 (k) clearance, we are better positioned to serve bariatric surgeons. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2018, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2018 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 15%. We are now increasing our forecast and estimate full year 2018 procedure growth of 14.5% to 16.5%. Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71.5% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade and mix, and the impact of new product introductions. Turning to operating expenses. We continue to expect to grow pro forma 2018 operating expenses between 16% and 18% above 2017 levels as we follow through on investments in several strategic areas intended to benefit the Company over the long term. We continue to expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $245 million and $255 million in 2018 as forecast on our last call. We expect other income, which is comprised of mostly interest income to total between $70 million and $75 million 2018, up from $55 million to $60 million forecast on our last call. With regards to income tax, on our last call, we forecast our 2018 pro forma income tax rate to be between 20% and 21% of pretax income. We are now shifting our estimates slightly lower to a range of between 19.5% and 25.5% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: I want to start with the U.S. procedure growth. You’ve had about 300 basis points sequential acceleration. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about that? I mean, hernia has obviously been doing well for a while, but you really seem to have an inflection here. So can you talk to maybe the sustainability of what you saw here in the quarter?
Marshall Mohr: We approach procedure enablement by designing system, instruments and imaging and software elements with surgeon feedback, and with the introduction of our Xi systems and our next-generation advanced instruments and refinements imaging software. Our customers are seeing real value in general surgery, particularly with the gen-four systems. And you mentioned hernia repair and colorectal, they’ve been leading adoption. And we’ve seen organic interest from bariatric surgeons as well as our SureForm 60 stapler comes to market and with the addition of gen-four labeling in bariatric so far to serving those opportunities as well.
Gary Guthart: One of the things we look at, as you know, is stick rates to reorder rates, and just to see our people trialing or are they staying with it. In hernia repair and colorectal, we’re seeing nice stick rates on those side. So we feel like we're building momentum here. You also have sustainability, and I think prostatectomy -- urologic increases, as well as gynecologic increases in U.S. have surprised me. And I don’t have much confidence that those are sustainable.
Tycho Peterson: And then thinking a little bit ahead on pipeline. Can you talk a little bit about the data roadmap for flex cath? Obviously, you’re doing a lot of the optimization work in the manufacturing side. But how should we think about incremental data coming out ahead of the launch?
Gary Guthart: Nothing new to report for you there. Certainly, as it starts coming into the market, you'll see early site start to take broader data collection and so on. With regard to what regulators want to see, we’ll see what happens with regard to their feedback to our submission when that occurs. So I don't have anything to point you to at this time.
Tycho Peterson: And the last one. Gary, you mentioned interest in SP beyond the initial opportunities that you’ve talked about. Are you willing to comment on some of those areas? It seems like there is some interest in cardiology based on -- others have done. How prevalent is that in some of your early discussions?
Gary Guthart: I have been pleased so far with the interest that SP is generating our customers to explore where it can create real value. The things we’ve talked about with your earlier quarterly some interest in urology, we think there’ll be really interest just and colorectal surgery, in transoral surgery as well. There are -- we've had early discussions in several other specialties. I think it’s very early to start pointing our investor base, I think, towards one or the other is probably too soon. That said, it provides access to the body that comes in fundamentally differently than an Xi brings instruments into the body. And we did that because we think it will provoke interest and value creation in other places, as we get more experience, as these come out into the world then we’ll keep you up-to-date.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Amit Hazan with Citi. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Jamie on for Amit, can you hear me okay?
Calvin Darling: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: So first the question is just on system features. When you think about the benefits and challenges of an open console and also separately the benefits and challenges of a system with arms mounted on a table. How do you guys think about those types of features that your competitors are starting to talk about?
Gary Guthart: Just zooming out for a minute, I think the way we think about it for customers is what allows for smooth operations across a population of patients and a broad set of procedure types from neurology, to gynecology, to general surgery, to thoracic surgery and so on. And as we think about those things, we've been at this for a long-time. The idea of mounting things to tables, the idea of mounting them to floors, of having them to be modular of using open consoles versus consoles that have immersive viewers, have been around quite a bit. And we have evaluated and tried a lot of them. We came to these decisions not based on white board analysis, but on building things and talking to our customers and working through it. So it doesn’t mean that we’re right, it could absolutely mean that somebody else did something slightly different and they evaluated it differently, but we were not casual about this. And we did it with serving a population of patients, the population of surgeons across procedure set in mind. With that I'm comfortable where the Company has made its investments.
Unidentified Analyst: And then a question on the imaging side, with what you guys are working on for the first generation launch of that. Is that basically going of be pretty off images only, or is there a possibility to do real time imaging in that first generation launch? Just help us understand the technology roadmap from here and timing expectations.
Gary Guthart: I'm not quite sure when you say first gen imaging. We have done a lot of things in imaging for a lot of years, so perhaps a little clarity on what…
Unidentified Analyst: For the imaging only side of things…
Gary Guthart: With regard to this -- I think you’re talking a little bit about image fusion and the idea of using preoperative images like CT scans or MRI with endoscopic images and fusing those two together. Again, I guess they have been around for many years. Today, in existing shipping systems, customers can use, something called to bring preoperative images and compare them in real time to what you’re using. There are some other things in the works that allow for tighter integration of those images and fusion. We have not set expectations on timelines nor on future content yet. We have a lot of technology capability there. We will bring something out when we feel like it really makes a difference in surgeons’ lives, and enable them to either create different outcomes, or be more efficient. There is potential, nothing to update you in terms of timing.
Operator: And we’ll go to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis: Gary or team, I want to start with systems momentum in the first half of the year. So last quarter, we saw increased trade-ups and again this quarter. So I just wonder how are the dynamics in your mind different this quarter than last quarter, what are your thoughts of sustainability of these systems trends? And maybe concerns on driving SP here in the back half of the year as you’re also aggressively driving customers to the gen-four platform? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Gary Guthart: We don’t see a real change in terms of momentum from one quarter to another, in our first quarter and second, other than as you indicated. You see a higher percentage of trading. The fourth generation products has some features in it, I think that we’re seeing an excitement from the general surgeons about utilizing for the procedures we talked about earlier, colorectal procedures, thoracic procedure. And I think hospitals and surgeons want to avail to that technology, so we're seeing trade outs. We're also seeing some desire to have standardization within the hospital where they only have one set of instrumentation to manage rather than two. And so tradings are difficult to predict as to where we are in a particular cycle or how much will happen in any particular quarter. But what we have seen is a slight increase in those trades.
Marshall Mohr: Two things on that, one is customer use and efficiencies with the generation-four platform is quite good. So we are pleased to see their interest and to the extent that we’re going to be flexible and help them move in the gen-four we will. With regard to SP, our initial thought here on the phase one of launch is not to do an enormous placement capital placement of SP. It’s really to establish local data centers and build out the value story as we go and to really begin the early collection for next indications. Over time as we build out that experience base, our interest in expanding the SP footprint will increase but that's a multi-quarter conversation, not a really quick turn. SP long-term and I think we’ve talked about it. In beginning, SP will go out as full systems. But as we build out the evidence-base, it will be part of the gen-four platform that will be easy to upgrade and configure as part of gen-four, and that’s been part of our thought process for some time.
David Lewis: And then Gary or team, just on Asia-Pac strategy broadly, didn’t hear much about Japan in this particular transcript. How are you encouraged by the early traction in Japan? Is that on plan or ahead of plan, maybe comments there? And then Gary, you’ve talked about before I think you made some statements that, at a certain point of the year, the absence of the China quota obviously reduces the likelihood this year. Any updated thoughts on the likelihood of China this year and any impact on just tariff rhetoric on getting that deal done? Thanks so much.
Gary Guthart: On Japan, first quarter here after the listing, we’re pleased with the interest of the customer base. Our train facilities are busy, we’re pleased with that. We are really testing the capabilities now of our new reformed or newly grown team in Japan to really execute. So I think a little early to tell the ultimate performance there, first steps looks fine. I think there's more to do. And so our team and we are focused on really execution, it’s not a big strategy question it’s getting the training pathway, the factoring pathway, the follow-up pathway, the support onsite really built and operating well. And that’s what we’ve asked the team to focus on and we will be focused on. The first step of demand generation looks really good. So moving to China, I’ll speak briefly to the quota. I’ll ask Marshall to speak briefly to the impact, potential impact of tariffs. On the quota side, we have no real update to supply with. We are awaiting an initial quota. No news there. Overall, I think the atmospherics that are going on globally do not help that conversation. I don't have anything specific to tell you there. But generally speaking, I think the atmospherics of those conversations are not helping the quota generation. We do see, as we have told you in last calls that a procedure upside is going to require additional capital if we think the demand is there. And so there is a problem we need to solve. China is important to us, as a market and for joint venture. We are committed to it. And we are going to have to work through current macro challenges that are out there. Marshall, you might speak too?
Marshall Mohr: Tariff situation is obvious for dynamic. The first run of tariff have been imposed do impact some of the components that our suppliers use to supply us. We’re under the -- we're studying that as we speak. We think that the estimated impact will be modest in terms of the increase in product cost for our systems. That's not a cost or a level that we're going to pass in those costs on to customers at this point in time.
Operator: And we’ll go to Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: I want to start with SP. Gary you characterized interest in SP as high. I was wondering if you can just go in a little more detail and comment maybe on which types of accounts are expressing initial levels of interest. And will you restrict a center -- if they’re interested in SP, will you restrict them. So I just want to get a little more color on how you’re thinking about SP?
Gary Guthart: In terms of accounts, there is a fair amount of interest that's I think broad across the segments. For us -- first of all, we have a set of clearances that we have that will allow access to get started, and then subsequent data collection to do for additional clearances. So that will determine the early access strategy there as is really around what clearances we have and the ones we want to pursue in the future. We will be supply limited for the first few quarters here. So the answer there is there will be a bit of a line to put these first set out as we go. And as we get the additional clearances and master the technology then I think that gets a lot easier. But it will be a design rollout to start.
Bob Hopkins: Also you made a comment in prepared remarks about the potential for volatility and capital for the rest of 2018. Is that just because there can always be volatility in capital, or is there something specific that you’re referring to?
Marshall Mohr: No, nothing specific, it's really the -- just in general, it’s hard to predict capital given budget cycles, given government regulations, in the case of China and just seasonality. And so it's just hard to predict when hospitals will actually purchase, and so you can see it be lumpy overtime.
Gary Guthart: What happens also is the aggregate reporting of course averages a lot of lumpiness that happens underneath. So even if the aggregate looks smooth, regional variances can be reasonably high. And so it's just as Marshall properly said, nothing specific but the general dynamics that are out there.
Bob Hopkins: Particularly on stapler and vessels sealing. If you’re successful with those launches, should we start to see upward momentum in your revenue per procedure? I realized there is lot of things that affect that line, but those are two pretty chunky products. And just curious if you’re successful with those launches, should we expect that line item to start to move higher?
Marshall Mohr: When you look at revenue per procedure overall, there is clearly some variance quarter-to-quarter. We talked a lot about customer timing, order timing and things like that. So quarter-to-quarter, you see those things. And we are seeing an increase in contribution from advanced instruments, including our stapling products, which are getting more usage, as well as vessel sealing. We introduced a new version of our Vessel Sealer Extend in the last quarter. And now the 60 millimeter stapler that we’ll be rolling out here in the third quarter with expanded access available in the fourth quarter. That's just serves to expand this category further around our product line a little further for stapling and provide a more optimized tool within the category of bariatric. So the simple answer is yes that that will just be more on our advanced instrument side of things that that element will serve to be a tailwind for revenue per procedure.
Operator: We we’ll go to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: You did I think 16.5% procedure growth in the first half of the year, if I’m doing the math right. So just my question is the second half, the guidance implies about 12.5% to 16.5% in the second half of the year, again, if I’m doing the math right. But the question is, Calvin, what gets you to the low and gets you to high and what are some of the assumptions that would get you to the high and low end there? And I have one follow-up.
Calvin Darling: You’re sitting six months into the year now. Year-to-date, procedures are actually rounding up to 17% as you described. And so it’s pretty straight forward. I think you look at it right now at the high end of the range. We are talking about a continuity of the trends we saw in the first half across geographies and procedure sets. Then at the lower end of the ranges, we are talking about moderation, Marshall talked a little bit about the mature procedures. And we continue to beat our expectations in these categories, urology and oncology, in the U.S. But some moderation in those categories would be considered at the low end. And even in general surgery, where we’ve been performing very strong just somewhat less robust growth in now our largest category in the U.S., contemplating the lower end.
Larry Biegelsen: And then for my follow up, I think bariatric has been tough to convert because of good lab outcomes. What’s your strategy to penetrate this market, how meaningful is 60 millimeter stapler driving adoption? And what should we expect from an uptake standpoint? Thanks for taking the questions.
Gary Guthart: On bariatrics really, our customers have pointed us here. This is one where, as you’ve said, there is a fair amount of penetration of laparoscopy. And outcomes are generally good. And so you’re going to ask why are they asking here, what’s the organic interest? Like all things we said to you in earlier procedure adoptions, in the early days, there are clearly sub-segments of a particular procedure. In the case bariatrics, sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass, revision procedures all underlying segments. And that where we find value as an entry point, I think we’ll have to develop over time. Clearly, in regional surgeries in complex co-morbid cases, we see real interest on the part of surgeons. And so that appears to be a place that they are finding some entry point. There is a wildcard here as Calvin alluded to, which is there is an ergonomic benefit for laparoscopists. And bariatric surgeons tend to be high volume surgeons and it tends attempt to be a challenging -- physically a challenging procedure and there may be some value there too. So we’re not ready yet to call what the market sizes of those sub segments and where exactly all the value creation will be, but the organic interest is pretty high. And so we’re going to engage our customers and follow their lead here. And short answer is stay tuned.
Operator: And we’ll go to Rich Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: The first one, Gary or team. We picked up on a couple of institutions who have said that they’re looking at new ways to get increased systems into their in to their hospitals, just given the demand from general surgeons that don’t have enough time on their existing footprint. And I'm just curious, what are some of the ways that we can think you might get creative on placing the systems beyond operating leases? Would you do minimum volume commitments for some upfront system statement model? Whereby as the volumes aren't met over some predetermined time, you take the system -- you have the right to take the systems back. And that was one model we had heard discuss. I was just curious, is this happening or there are other creative ways that you’re potentially going to accelerate your footprint ahead of competition coming?
Marshall Mohr: First of all, the objective is to get systems out there and to get them productive and to provide improved surgery to patients. I think we've been flexible with leases. And when I say flexible we've structured those very short term leases almost rentals that we get them at the budget cycle to what you would call [plain vanilla] leases that have five year term with the piece of equipment staying with the customer at the end of the lease. We're willing to be flexible even further. And so although, we have talked about different models, I don’t think that we've rolled anything out that it is important to the results at this point, but we will be flexible. We’ll think about different models to get to -- eliminate the barrier from a capital expenditure perspective.
Gary Guthart: The major things we're looking for when thinking about flexibility here, really on the customer side, is that they have a long-term commitment in terms of access to the system that the access matters to them. We have confidence in our systems such that we're not too worried about a right of return and things like that. I think that if -- this is a group that understands robotic surgery, understands the value of robotic system surgery relative to other forms of surgery then we’re willing to take some financial risk, if they really are committed in terms of how they want to implement the program, how they want to train their surgeons and so on.
Richard Newitter: And then just a quick follow-up, I think Calvin you had mentioned that SP and the phased rollout is initially only going to be sold as a standalone console, but then it eventually will be worked into entire fourth-generation package. How should we think about the ASP on SP as we model out maybe the initial placements, is it like 20% to 30% premium to what SP will be as we move out beyond 2019? How should we think about that?
Calvin Darling: As a standalone systems there should be a slight premium to our Xi less than 20% to 30% more or like in the 5% range.
Operator: And we’ll go to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Isaac Ro: Just another question on Asia, I'm curious in Japan with the new coverage there. You talked about an acceleration, I'm wondering how you think that accelerating curve will play out over the balance of the year as it relates to your guidance. What's embedded in the Japan part of your outlook?
Gary Guthart: Let me do a just little bit of qualitative and then you can speak to the quantitative. Qualitatively, while we had I think 12 traditional procedures some of which are sub- procedures of each other, added in terms of reimbursement listing. They will not all drive at the same rate concurrently. Some will take precedence over others in terms of priority for training and priority for development. The team is working through that now. So as we do our forecasting model, it's not a simultaneous event, its focus, and deliver, and really drive high-value through our teams to the customer. Calvin?
Calvin Darling: Just quickly as we move beyond the urologic dVP and prostatectomy into this broader set. As we described in the earlier comments, it’s a foundational building period. We’re very pleased and satisfied with one quarter’s activity is focused on training and new programs and all the support that they require on the field. But in terms of the pure numbers, this is not a big factor in terms of the high-end and low end of guidance that where we may project overall. The overall proportion of procedures in Japan relative to the worldwide is something in the two percentage range. So it's a phenomenal opportunity in the long run in Japan. But in the near term, it’s really more building programs and less of the impact that will have on full year procedure growth for the Company.
Isaac Ro: Follow up is on the hernia market, I think that’s obviously huge potential opportunity for you guys. And I think the thinking there has evolved over the years. And now that you’ve got I think a little bit of accelerated traction there. It would be helpful if you could maybe provide for us price some updated buckets or maybe chapters of market development that we can think through in terms of the types of procedures that you think are really driving the near-term adoption versus those that might be intermediate or long-term opportunities. Just anything help us segment what is clearly a very heterogeneous and larger opportunity for you guys. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: I think it’s a good question it’s not something we’re prepared to do on this call. And it is true just frankly that our view of these opportunities and markets evolves overtime as surgeons start to explore the capabilities of these systems, find value in different places, and as we get to understand really the sub-segments of markets better. We do -- our view does progress. We will think about it to what has changed where it is. I don’t think here we’re ready to tell you that we’re ready to forecast something differently. But it is moving to a different phase and it's worth thinking through that phase.
Operator: And we go to Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Larry Keusch: Gary, I couldn’t help but notice that in the U.S, I think its 87% of the systems placed where Xi, which obviously suggest hospitals continue to go after the most capable system despite the availability of the lower priced X. So could you talk a little bit about the trends there between Xi and X in the U.S.?
Gary Guthart: I think in a sense it comes down to how people think through this trade-off between clinical value and economic value, and where they see value relative to capital entry price. And in many, many places as we you look at this deeply the capital price, the capital component is not the driving determinant of cost. If you look at total cost to treat per patient episode, which is in my opinion the most relevant economic question here, the total costs of caring for that patient are absolutely dominated by outcomes and dominated by human labor. And so the material costs that flows through tiny fraction of all of it. And for those folks capital access and who see that who’ve done analysis, I think what they really ask themselves is what’s going to give us the best outcomes and the highest efficiency and standardization. And they make that out of commitments and so that's what we see. And I think that results in acquisitions of excise. If folks are capital constrained, and by the way that said of criteria can vary a little bit region-to-region. I do think total cost to treat per patient episode translates well across country boundaries. But different organizations have different approval processes and capital allocation processes. They may choose to get started with lower capital cost system. If they want to do that, we're happy to support them and that's the next. So in our prepared remarks, we had talked about our allocation of these systems, fitting our view of the world regionally and that's why.
Larry Keusch: And then I guess the other question is, I know the SI is certainly around for a period of time. And there has been ability to offer refurbished systems at a discount for those that are really looking for less expensive capital equipment. But is there a place in the portfolio for a more de-featured system that would have even a lower capital cost. Do you think about that as also potentially part of the portfolio at some point?
Gary Guthart: We will listen extremely carefully to our customers’ needs, and recognize that customer needs are three A, triple A, that outcomes efficiencies, workflow, standardization, and return on investment and the high responsiveness to patient need, a high patient centricity. Those needs we’re going to look for really carefully if in that set of analysis a further de-featured system make sense of course we will pursue that, and we're always looking. I don’t think that it is obvious right off the back that less capable systems at lower capital prices make those three aims a lot better, but we are constantly asking ourselves.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will be from Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brandon Henry: One of your robotic flex cath competitors has recently partnered with a division of J&J for its latest technology. Can you spend some time discussing how you see the future direction for the flex cath platform beyond lung biopsies? And specifically, what do you think is the right modality for ablative technology. And is this technology that Intuitive already has internally, or is it something that Intuitive will need to acquire in the future?
Gary Guthart: First thing as we have said before, we’re excited about flex catheter technologies, particularly in lung. I think it can make a big difference there. But it's a platform and we think it will have applications beyond the lung. We are focused on creating value in the lung to start that does not say that our vision will not extend further, that's step one. Step one, with regard to the idea of see entry. If you can go and do detection and then be in a position to treat it, things are very compelling in vision. And it's a vision we share, we think that's interesting. There are many different ablative technologies and approaches within technologies. Ablation has been around for quite some time. It's not a trivial or obvious therapeutic approach. It will take serious design and serious clinical validation to really understand where those things are. That's going to be a multiyear pathway for anybody. So we’re not surprised to see others’ interest in it that is not new to us, not a new thought for us. We think there are opportunities there. We think there are multiple pathways to get the good solutions. We are investing in those. Some of that is organic. Some of it is partnered. Ss we evolve, we will share more of that with you.
Brandon Henry: Thank you.
Gary Guthart: All right. Well, thank you very much. That was our last question. As we’ve said previously, while we focus on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We have built our Company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you we’ll remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your teleconference. We thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may disconnect.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-04-17 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Calvin Darling - Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations Gary Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director Marshall Mohr - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President
Analysts: David Lewis - Morgan Stanley Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan Amit Hazan - Citi Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners Rick Wise - Stifel Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q1 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer-session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Senior Director of Finance and Investor Relations, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO, and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 2, 2018. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of first quarter financial results, and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2018; and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. Intuitive is dedicated to the mission of improving the availability and quality of minimally invasive surgery. We had a strong first quarter in pursuit of our mission with customer use of our systems at the top of our growth range, continued momentum in new system placements, and stepwise progress in the development of markets outside the United States. While we're pleased with our performance in the quarter the opportunity for improvement in surgery is substantial and much work remains to be done.  Global procedure growth was approximately 15% in the first quarter of 2018. Underpinning this growth was increased use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, continued growth in urology in Europe and Asia, and multispecialty growth in China. General surgery growth was led by hernia repair and colon resection. Mature procedures in the United States including prostatectomy and hysterectomy for malignant conditions grew above expected rates again in the quarter. European procedure growth was mixed by country partially as a result of headwinds in the number of business days relative to Q1, 2017.  Lastly, additional procedures were granted reimbursement by the Ministry of Health in Japan effective April 1, 2018 at reimbursement rates equivalent to laparoscopy. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.  Our capital placement performance in the first quarter of 2018 accelerated relative to 2017 with growth in total placements rising 39% from 133 to 185. Net of trade-ins and retirements our da Vinci installed base grew by 13% over Q1 2017 from approximately 4,023 to approximately 4,528. Placement performance was strong globally particularly in the United States. Capital placements have been lumpy and we anticipate volatility in placements for the remainder of 2018.  Turning to operations. Our performance in the first quarter met our expectations with good performance in product quality and cost reductions while average selling prices were stable. Investments to deepen our regional capabilities and to develop new technologies and services continued to be important in the first quarter. They will be so for the next several quarters as we progress through the launch of several products and build the capability country-by-country. We are also investing to strengthen our corporate infrastructure and position us to benefit from increased scale.  Highlights of our first quarter operating results are as follows. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the first quarter of last year, replaced 185 da Vinci surgical systems, up from a 133 in the first quarter of 2017. Our installed base grew 13% from a year ago. Revenue for the quarter was $848 million up 25%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.6% compared to 72% in the first quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $460 million, up 21%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $623 million, representing 73% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $346 million in the quarter, up 30% from the first quarter of last year and pro forma net income was $288 million up 46%. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly.  Our da Vinci Xi surgical system is our most capable multiport platform. We added our da Vinci X surgical system in 2017 which offers fourth generation imaging, robotics, and instrumentation for focused quadrant surgeries at an attractive value. The da Vinci X surgical systems received regulatory clearance by PMDA in Japan this month and was showcased at a large surgical society meeting JSS shortly thereafter. Combined with reimbursement approvals mentioned above, we're pleased with recent progress in Japan. As we've discussed on prior calls, we plan to expand our Gen 4 family with a new capability in the form of da Vinci SP. We submitted our 510 (k) for current SP design in Q4 of '17 and have received questions back from FDA. We're preparing our response and overall SP is progressing to plan with a phased launch anticipated in 2018.  Also, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we submitted our 510 (k) application for our 60-millimeter surgical stapler for Gen 4 systems. We've received the first round of questions from FDA and are in the process of responding to their requests. Our Gen 4 systems have received growing use by surgeons globally and by general surgeons in particular. Including the 60-millimeter stapler, we're hard at work completing our advanced instrument offerings. We continue to make progress on our flexible robotics platform first targeted to address the acute need in diagnosis of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection is important. Feedback from physicians evaluating our technology relative to existing and recently announced alternatives has been strongly supportive of our efforts. Our design and operations teams are working to incorporate their feedback, complete its production design and supply chain optimization, and complete validations for regulatory submissions. We anticipate our 510 (k) submission in 2018 and we have initiated the build of our commercial team, an outstanding and focused team of professionals. I believe the opportunity for innovation in support of physicians in the flexible interventional space is substantial. That said, adoption will require clinical and economic validation given the availability of multiple competing approaches in the market.  Lastly, our imaging teams continue to develop new ways to identify tissue including progress in our molecular imaging program as well as improvements for our endoscopes and image processing algorithms. We have been introducing improvements in our imaging hardware routinely and expect to continue to do so in the remainder of 2018. We expect our lead molecular agent to enter phase 2 trials in the second half of the year.  Stepping back and looking at the broader marketplace, our team’s experience in robot-assisted surgery started decades ago at research groups predating the formation of the company. Over this period, the rise of mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new approaches to old problems. Intuitive has been investing in innovation both incremental and revolutionary with this in mind since our inception and with increased intensity for the past several years. This opportunity to improve surgery using advanced technologies is now being recognized broadly particularly in the past several years and we anticipate the entry of additional systems by competitors into some regions of the world over the next several quarters.  To help our customers, Intuitive products and services are organized in generational families. Shared design principles, operating methods, user interfaces and product training allow surgical teams and hospitals to more quickly integrate new technologies and can deliver a significantly improved framework to training environments.  As consolidation has progressed in health systems, standardization across surgical platforms can decrease variability and inefficiency from residency and fellowship programs to academic and community settings. Our fourth generation of surgical platforms offer our customers a fully enabled ecosystem of products and services in support of their programs. In closing, during 2018, our focus remains in completing the task we’ve set for ourselves. First, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery. Second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia. Third, advancing our new platforms, imaging, advanced instruments, da Vinci SP and our flexible catheter platform. And finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region. I will now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a GAAP and non-GAAP or pro forma basis. Our results are also posted on our website. First quarter 2018 revenue of $848 million grew 25% compared with first quarter 2017 revenue of $680 million and decreased 5% compared with seasonally stronger fourth quarter revenue of $892 million.  In the first quarter of 2017 we deferred approximately $23 million of revenue associated with the da Vinci X tradeoff program that we offered certain first quarter customers. This revenue and related costs are recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. Our comparison to 2017 results reflects a deferral as recorded.  We also have adopted the new revenue standard as required under GAAP and retroactively restated prior period results. We have updated the supplementary financial tables posted on our website to reflect this restatement.  The adoption of the revenue standard had the effective increasing first quarter 2017 total revenue by approximately $5 million and net income by approximately $1 million. The impact on the annual results for 2017 was insignificant increasing total 2017 revenue by approximately $9 million and increasing net income by $11 million.  Revenue also benefited by approximately 2.5 percentage points from a weaker dollar. Excluding the impact of the revenue deferral and currency changes, revenue grew 18% relative to the restated 2017 first quarter. First quarter 2018 procedures increased approximately 15% compared with first quarter of 2017 in reflect with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the US and neurology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call. Instrument and accessory revenue of $460 million increased 21% compared with last year which is higher than procedure growth primarily reflecting increased usage of our advanced instruments and customer buying patterns. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,930, an increase of 5% compared with last year primarily reflecting advanced instrument usage, customer buying patterns and the impact of a weaker US dollar. Systems revenue of $235 million increased 46% compared with the first quarter of 2017 primarily reflecting higher system placements, the revenue deferral of $23 million in the first quarter of 2017 and a weaker US dollar particularly offset -- partially offset by an increase in the number of operating leases. We placed 185 systems in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 133 systems in the first quarter of 2017 in 216 systems last quarter.  43 operating lease transactions representing 23% of total placements were completed in the current quarter, compared with 16% of total placements in the first quarter of 2017, and 19% last quarter. While the number of leases is difficult to predict in the short term we expect the proportion of these types of arrangements to increase long-term. 31% of the current quarter system placements involve trade-ins reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on our four-generation technology. This is an increase in the proportion of trade-ins compared to 21% in the first quarter 2017 and 26% last quarter. However, trade-in activity is lumpy and difficult to predict. 76% of systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xi’s, and 16% were da Vinci X systems, compared with 67% da Vinci Xis and 24% da Vinci Xs last quarter. Our install base of da Vinci systems ended the quarter at 4,528 systems up 13% year-over-year and average system utilization grew in the low single digit range. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases, lease buyouts and revenue deferrals was approximately 1.49 million which is slightly higher than the 1.47 million in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects a higher mix of Xi systems, a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by geographic mix.  Outside of the U.S. results were as follows. First quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of 275 million increase 49% compared with the first quarter of 2017 and increased 11% compared with last quarter. The increase compared to the prior year reflects increased systems revenue of 55 million or nearly 100% growth and increased instruments and accessories revenue of 30 million or 32% growth. Systems revenue was driven by an increase in the number of systems placed, a lower number of operating leases, favorable product and geography mix and a weaker dollar. Instrument and accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth, a weaker dollar and customer buying patterns. OUS procedures grew approximately 18% compared with the first quarter of 2017, OUS procedures were somewhat negatively impacted by the timing of holidays in 2018 compared to 2017. Outside of U.S. we placed 73 systems in the first quarter, compared with 56 in the first quarter of 2017 and 86 in a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Current quarter system placements included 45 in the Europe, nine in Japan, 63% of the systems placed for da Vinci Xi’s compared with 54% in the first quarter of 2017 and 48% last quarter. Placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles and vacation patterns and sales in some markets are constrained by government regulations.  Moving onto the remainder of the P&L, the pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was 71.6% compared with 72% for the first quarter of 2017 and 72.4% last quarter. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter primarily reflects higher fixed cost over the lower volumes. The decrease compared with the prior year primarily reflects product mix. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products mix of systems and accessory revenue. System ASPs and our ability to further reduce product and improved manufacturing efficiency.  Pro forma operating expenses increased 17% compared with the first quarter of 2017 and reflect compared to the last quarter. Our spending is consistent with our plan reflecting investments in da Vinci SP, catheter-based robotics, image and advanced instrumentation and expansion of our OUS markets. These investments involved multi-year commitments.  Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20.1% compared with our expectations of 20% to 22%. Our tax rates will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items.  Our first quarter 2018, pro forma net income was $288 million or $2.44 per share compared with $197 million or $1.71 per share for the first quarter of 2017 and $305 million or $2.60 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter 2017 GAAP to pro forma net income per diluted share excluding $0.09 per share from the deferral of $23 million of revenue net of cost and income tax.  I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $288 million or $2.44 per share for the first quarter of 2018 compared with GAAP net income of $181 million or $1.57 per share for the first quarter of 2017 and a GAAP net loss of $32 million or $0.28 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified in our website. It includes fourth quarter charges related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee equity and IT charges and legal settlements. Note that the IRS has not issued final regulations associated with the recent U.S. Tax Legislation. Therefore, impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reflected in our fourth and first quarter results and our projection of future tax rates represent our best estimates of the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and could change as the tax regulations are finalized and further interpreted.  We ended the quarter with cash in investments of $4.1 billion compared with $3.8 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase reflects cash generated from operations of $280 million. We have not repurchased any shares in the quarter and have approximately $718 million remaining under board buyback authorization.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2018. 
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 15% compared to 18% during the first quarter of 2017 and 17% last quarter. Our year-over-year Q1 procedure growth was driven by 14% growth in U.S. procedures and 18% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., overall, Q1 procedure performance by specialty closely aligned with patterns present in 2017.  In U.S. general surgery, first quarter 2018 growth was consistent with 2017. Q1 growth was again driven by hernia repair which continues to provide the most incremental cases and continued da Vinci adoption in colorectal procedures. Early stage adoption in bariatric procedures and growth across the breadth of the general surgery category also contributed to growth.  In U.S. gynecology, first quarter 2018 growth was consistent with 2017 trends as procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth led by hysterectomy. We believe gynecologic procedure consolidation continues to drive modest growth as an increasing proportion of US gynecology procedures are being performed by physicians that specialize in complex, benign and cancer surgery who tend to be uses of da Vinci systems.  Q1 US urology procedures had growth rates consistent with 2017 driven by prostatectomy volumes. As a mature procedure category, we believe that our US prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, which has benefited from recent macro trends.  In other US procedures, adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was again solid during the first quarter. Utilization of our da Vinci XI systems and surgical staplers which helped to optimize robotics thoracic procedures has been increasing. First quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 18% compared with 23% for the full year of 2017. First quarter 2018 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in DVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery and gynecology. The Q1 2018 OUS procedure growth rate was lower than the previous year, in part due to fewer operating days in Q1 2018 from the timing of holidays including Easter.  Procedure growth in China moderated meaningfully in the quarter in part because of da Vinci system capacity expansion is constrained by the system quota requirements, the most recent of which expired at the end of 2015. We believe core demand for robotic surgery in China is meaningful.  In Japan, Q1 procedure growth and prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy moderated as these procedures have achieved high levels of adoption. As Gary indicated, effective April 1, 2018 12 additional procedures have been approved for reimbursement in Japan with reimbursements equivalent to laparoscopic surgery. The applicable opportunity for da Vinci adoption within the set of procedures is difficult to estimate at this time due to the uncertainty of the perceived value of da Vinci relative to alternative surgical approaches.  With nearly 300 systems installed in Japan, the level and pace of system expansion in Japan over the year is difficult to predict but it will likely be modest.  Last week, we participated in the Annual Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons or SAGES Meeting in Seattle. General surgery is our largest and fastest growing specialty surgical specialty in the US and this event represents one of the largest gatherings of general surgery practitioners and thought leaders.  As more general surgeons adopt robotics in their practices, at this year’s conference we continue to see increased numbers of robotic surgery presentations, clinical papers and podium speakers. Included in the clinical data presented at SAGES, the results of a study recently accepted for publication in their Hernia Journal titled Open Versus Robotic-Assisted Transabdominal Preperitoneal Inguinal Hernia Repair, a multi-centered match analysis of clinical outcomes. Data from this study was presented by lead author, Dr. Reza Gamagami from New Lenox, Illinois. This study is one of the largest multi-centered valuations of outcomes associated with robotic assisted inguinal hernia repair cases compared to more experienced open cases from the same surgeons.  In the MAST analysis of 444 subjects in each cohort, robotic assisted inguinal hernia repair cases demonstrated statistically significant lower post discharge complication rates through 30 days with no re-operations related to the inguinal repair.  A multi-varied analysis showed the open repair approach as a risk factor for complications within 30 days of the inguinal repair procedure. This study confirmed a robotic assisted approach to inguinal hernia repair may provide patients with the benefits of minimally invasive surgery with the authors who had variable laparoscopic experience among them, concluding that the robotic assisted repair approach is a promising and reproducible approach which may facilitate the adoption of MIS repairs of inguinal hernia. The study adds to the growing body of evidence demonstrating comparable or improved outcomes for subjects undergoing a robotic assisted inguinal hernia repair, independent of a surgeon’s laparoscopic experience. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2018. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2018 procedure growth within a range of 11% to 15%. We are now refining the range and estimate full year 2018 procedure growth of 12% to 15%. With respect to revenue as we have mentioned previously capital placements are ultimately driven by procedure growth catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital placements can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including U.S. healthcare policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles and competitive factors. We had strong first-quarter capital placements driven by customer capacity expansion and bolstered by a higher volume of capital upgrade transactions involving trade-ins of older da Vinci models in the recent quarters. In addition, as anticipated a higher proportion of Q1 system placements were under operating lease terms, 23%. This proportion may fluctuate some in the near term but may trend further upwards in the long-term. Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71.5% of net revenue. This is modestly lower than our Q1 result of 71.6%, primarily reflecting higher costs associated with new products we expect to introduce later in the year. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on products and regional mix.  Turning to operating expenses. We continue to expect to grow pro forma 2018 operating expenses between 16% and 18% above 2017 levels, as we follow through on investments in several strategic areas intended to benefit the company over the long-term. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between 245 million and 255 million in 2018 compared to 225 million to 235 million forecasts on our last call. We expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between 55 million and 60 million in 2018, up from 45 million to 55 million forecasts on our last call. With regard to income tax, on our last call we forecast our 2018 pro forma income tax rate to be between 20% and 22% of pretax income. We are now refining our estimates to the lower half of the range between 20% and 21% of pretax income. Note that in the future if the IRS issues additional guidance and interpretations of the new tax law our estimated rate may be impacted. That concludes our prepared comments, we’ll now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis: Gary a couple strategic questions for you. The first is on leasing. So, there is more operating leases in the last two quarters than the prior four quarters. And it feels like the 23% number is frankly going higher. So, it's starting to feel this is much more company driven than customer driven, and so the question is really to what extent does leases make a lot more sense as competitors are coming to market sort of in what way can leasing be very powerful defense?
Gary Guthart: Yeah, well first thank you. I think to the extent that we can help customers access robotics for their programs and do it in a way that fits their needs, we're happy to do it with leasing. I don't think it's a massive strategic change one way or another, viz-a-vis competition. From our point of view, we're confident in our products, we understand and are confident in the value they bring. If we can be flexible with customers and allow them to get access to the products they need when they need it, we can make it a little easier for them to do it sooner rather than later in terms of their finances, that helps us and we're willing.  I think over time; our customers are going to evaluate competitive systems. They're going to go look at them. And if somebody brings out a product that meets their needs better, I don't know that leasing one way or the other is going to make a difference. For us, it really is kind of a first principles thing. Do you believe in robotic surgery as a way to increase the availability and quality of minimally invasive surgery if you do and you're committed to it and we can find the way that help you get a system, and then we're happy to do it? 
David Lewis: Okay. And then curious, a question on flexible catheter system as well. So, based on your timeline, I'm kind of assuming you're 9 months behind a recent competitive launch. So, I just wonder how concerned you about this window are, and you talked a lot about the ecosystem both at SAGES and again in this call. In what ways can sort of the multi-system ecosystem approach be sort of a barrier to entry for new robotic entrants in this segment?
Gary Guthart: Yeah, I think in terms of any of the systems that we're going to place or somebody else places, I think the robot itself or the product itself is just the first step. You have to provide the robot, but you also need the instruments and accessories. You need to be able to help do product training, you need to build proctoring networks. You want to be able to help your customer do benchmarking and analytic analysis of usage patterns relative to what the rest of the world is doing.  And so, I think they expect support beyond the dropping off of a system at the backdoor. And we have built that over years, we have come to understand it deeply and I think it is valuable to our customer. And I think that helps us, I think other companies have various degrees of enablement in that space.  With regard to flex catheter in particular, we have been investing in it as you know for years and years. This has been a long-term investment. We have built technologies and made decisions about our architectures based on first principles not by looking over our shoulder at what other people are doing, but by really engaging customers deeply and understanding their clinical needs. That has driven us, continues to drive us. We have connections into the customer base because of those first principle investigations, and those folks visit us. They look at our technologies, they visit others and look at technologies on the market or soon to be on the market and they make decisions. We're going to make decisions based on clinical value and demonstrable outcomes. You’ve seen the early parts of that with regard to the publications at CHEST. I think there are advantages for people who are first movers, but I think they're short lived, I think that in this space because there are a lot of alternatives in the marketplace and because it’s going to be a market that’s driven by clinical data over time, the best solutions are going to win and I am confident in our technology and even more confident in our team.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Thanks for taking the question and good afternoon. So, as I looked at your print, obviously there’s lots of big impressive numbers in this first quarter report, but one that really caught my eye was the system sales number. And I know historically that’s primarily driven by procedure volumes and procedure volumes have been very strong. But I was wondering given this was really the best growth I think you’ve seen in system placements since 2010, was there anything in particular that drove the strength this quarter. Just wondering if you could sort of tease that a little bit more what happened in systems placements this quarter. Thank you. 
Gary Guthart: Bob, you are absolutely right, systems placements are driven primarily by procedure growth and you have to look at it over a period of time because systems can be lumpy in any particular quarter. So, if you look at 2017, the installed base grew 13% and procedures grew 16%. So those procedures that were really driving that installed base growth. This quarter we had a little bit higher proportion of trade outs. That reflects I think as I said in my script, customers wanting to avail themselves to fourth generation capabilities. And we also saw high sales of Xi validating that that system has features that really are driving adoption. So, I think it’s lumpy. I think it’s hard to make conclusions based on one quarter of increased trade-in volume and I just would be cautious there and we expect to see some volatility. But overall over a longer period time of time systems will follow procedure growth.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Thank you for that. And then I want to follow up also on one more question on flex catheter, just curious what’s left to do before you file with the FDA? And just maybe thinking a little bit longer term, but when do you think we might start to hear a little bit more about other potential indications for flex catheter beyond lung?
Gary Guthart: Sure. For now, as we said in earlier in the script the teams are doing the product validations, they are doing the testing that supports our submissions. And we are stabilizing the supply chain and that’s important when we launch we want to feel good about our ability to make the products, and our sub suppliers’ ability to make their parts. We are progressing. I think the team is doing a very good job. So, there we are progressing against our plan.  For starters, as I said I think in the past, I am excited the flex catheter technology because I think it’s a platform and we will have other opportunities outside of the lung. Where we are today is focused on bringing this first product to market and satisfying the needs of the interventional pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons. I think that is a major opportunity. I think perfecting the clinical pathways, the use of the product and data generation is important for us to focus on. And so, our organization is tightly focused on that mission now.
Bob Hopkins: Perfect. And then is there any update on China at all or?
Gary Guthart: Marshall might speak to kind of where -- I think you’re implying the quota but Marsh you speak to that.
Marshall Mohr: We really don’t have much of an update on the quota, we still sit here awaiting the finalization of that quota, again just to give you the background of the quota, really applies to the years 2016 through 2020, its part of the five year planning budgeting process that the Chinese government goes through, Central government has finalized the budget but has not yet done its -- completed its negotiations with provinces, and hospitals about who will get how many systems and so we wait.
Gary Guthart: I think in general what's going on there doesn't appear to be Intuitive specific, I think it’s more rolling through the centralized government processes, we think that the core interest by Chinese customers in our products and the company and robotic surgery more broadly is strong and we feel slight forward progress in terms of the way the process has been moving. We just can't call what the timelines are, and so we’re at the limits of our ability to influence that outcome.
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: It looks like you guys had 99%, almost 100% increase in the international system revenue but about a 30% increase in the year-over-year system shipped, Marshal what drove the difference in those growth rates?
Gary Guthart: So, a couple of things that I pointed out, one was that in 2017 we had six leases, in 2018 we have one, obviously when you have an operating -- and these operating leases, operating leases you don't have revenue, so, some of that is attributable to it. Also had a foreign exchange or currency exchange that was a -- when they're back here as the U.S. dollar has weakened over the year, and we also had a favorable mix of product. As I said, in my script, we had a high mix of Xi around the world that also included OUS, and we also had a favorable geographic mix. If you noticed there was substantive sales in to Europe and again these are lumpy so you can’t take one geography and extrapolate that forward, but in Europe we did well. We did a little bit lower sales relative to the prior year and some of our distribution markets where we sell at a lower price. So, you just put all those factors together and it adds up to increasing revenue to the extent that it did. 
Larry Biegelsen: And then for my follow-up we've been increasingly hearing that India did present itself as a large opportunity, potentially even becoming the number one international market. Could you talk a little bit about how you see that market developing this year and over the next few years?
Gary Guthart: We’re optimistic that India will represent a good market long term but I think in the short term to think that it’s going to snap to our second largest market, our first largest market is not happen. We have a distributor there, we've been working with for years, we've made -- I think we have around 40, 50 systems installed in India, the total -- but the total number of procedures that they generate is maybe 1% of our total revenue -- of our total procedures. So, it is not consequential yet. We are making investments in it, we do think it’s -- again long-term that it’s a viable market and a good one for us, but we’re at the very, very, very early stages.
Marshall Mohr: We’re are actually at 68 systems in India currently.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Maybe first question on emerging procedures. Bariatric got a little bit more attention at stages this year and Calvin you called that out in your comments. I know you're in the process of getting back to FDA with the questions on the Stapler. But Gary, can you maybe just talk a little bit how you think about this market evolving and how much market development you guys need to put behind once you get Stapler out?
Gary Guthart: It's going to be an interesting one to see evolve. I think it's early for us to put much commentary on it. We see interest by surgeons, having said that, it's a highly penetrated procedure with laparoscopy. And there are a lot of highly skilled laparoscopists in that market. And in that sense, it's stands in contrast to prostatectomy or hysterectomy for malonic conditions which were predominantly open procedures. So, we see some core demand and interest. Certainly, we want to complete the product offering in the Stapler. I think the real question there of where it could go overtime, I'd like to answer in future calls as we get a few quarters underneath the belt. 
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then thinking a little bit about Japan with reimbursement coming out at peri and lap. Does that change your view on the adoption curve at all? And are there steps you can take to try to increase these codes [ph] overtime and presumably that will require additional studies?
Gary Guthart: Yeah, I think that in general I think reimbursement decision is a positive for us. It's not an alloyed [ph] positive. I think that it will concentrate adoption into the bigger centers, that's okay. I think we're in a position to support that and we will do so. We all make investments for data collection in Japan. And the use of that data collection will be certainly something we can have to share with surgical societies and with the government as time goes on and to the extent that we show additional value and I think it's something that the government will consider for future reimbursements. I wouldn't ink anything on your calendars yet as to changes in reimbursement from this space. Although I think that there is some water to go under the bridge here. I think the interest -- having just been in Japan I think the interest is high. I think surgical society is seeing it as a positive step and endorsement by the government. I think that the economics in the right centers will work well for them. And it's an exciting for us and our team in Japan. And I'm looking forward to seeing them have a chance to broaden their base of business and get to know more customers. 
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then lastly on SP. Are you willing to comment, were there any surprises with FDA questions from your perspective? And then as we think about the rollout obviously you've talked about the three initial application areas. It seems like there is already some interest in other use cases. So, I'm just curious about how much pent up demand do you think there is out there today?
Gary Guthart: Yeah in terms of the nature of the questions that came back, I think it's within the kinds of conversations we've had with FDA over the years. And so, I think our teams are working on it. I don't see commentary that I would signal to you one way or another either particularly small questions or particularly big ones, I think it's right down the middle.  With regard to potential applications overtime. I think general interest in SP is high, which is exciting to me. And I think one of things that made us excited to invest in the first place is that it allows an approach to entry into the body that's little more flexible than multi-port approaches. And I think that will open some opportunities in the future for surgeons who are looking for alternatives.  Of course, that takes time. I will have to do protocol developments and data collection to get additional clearances as needed. But it was not unanticipated, that was part of what we had thought in terms of investing in the platform. This year will be a limited launch as we build volume and as we start to do things like enabling the proctor network and pursuing the sequential indications that we’ve talked about. So far so good, I think the team is on plan. I think the clinical response we’ve been getting from surgeons who are evaluating the data and looking at that base that looks really good.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Good afternoon, guys. I just had a couple of guidance questions and then one other for Gary. First on the procedure guidance. Just trying to understand the changes that you moved the numbers modestly but not too much that it was the toughest comp you had all year but at the nice 15% right at the top of your prior guide. Your installed base growth is still at 13% year holding really nicely. Just trying to understand what you are thinking about at the midpoint and low end of guidance now, it is OUS returning to 20% that growth or what else should we be thinking about both the low to mid-end procedure guidance?
Marshall Mohr: Yes, the elimination of the low end of the range or flex our Q1 performance including the continued growth in general surgery, colorectal US kind of on pace with the trends we saw in 2017. We also benefited from growth in -- and again mature gynecology, urology procedures. Our current guidance assumption is at the low end on the US side, probably in gynecology shifting over to low single-digit decline which we think is aligned with the overall benign hysterectomy market moving to low single-digit, neurology growth and then some moderation within general surgery mostly reflecting lot of big numbers with some modest contributions in thoracic, pediatrics and other earlier safe procedures.  We -- OUS no system quota in China to the extent it’s going to add capacity and it’s kind of a slower ramp in Japan with the new procedure set. On the high end they are still maintaining the trends in gynecology with low single-digit growth. Urology maybe some just minor moderation there to mid-single-digits growth and very slight moderation in US general surgery and continued nice trends in pediatrics and the emerging procedures. We do expect some moderation in China but probably less so at the high end of the range. 
Amit Hazan: And then kind of burning a question here that in a while for Gary, I just wanted to ask, give the success you’ve been experiencing, what’s the biggest risk you see for the Intuitive story today?
Gary Guthart: I guess I will start with -- I think the opportunity for the use of advanced technologies to help surgery is really substantial and there are both a lot of interesting scientific advances in the space we are in and there is a lot of need. I think there’s always there’s kind of two or three risks for an organization like ours I think has to manage. One of them is I think the day-to-day operations that are required to supply your customers can keep you from making the launch of investments to need to keep advancing the yard. And so, we manage that firmly. But I think that you need to do both and I think we’ll have missed a serious opportunity if the systems that are enrolled, a decade from now look like today, so I think that there’s real opportunity for advancement, so that’s one.  I think the second thing that’s just vital is that these things are complex technologies, they absolutely require outstanding human beings, and human capital and they need to be brought into a company that has a culture of satisfying the customer and performance and so I think washing out a culture with growth can be something that is a problem and we need to attend to it.  And I think the last thing is that healthcare is local, I think that when we want to make progress outside of the United States, it takes a deep understanding of the countries that we’re working in and real skill and capability there. The metal may look the same but the healthcare system in the way it values products differs and I think that being too shallow in those assessments can meet risk in underperformance and if we underperform than others will satisfy the need. So those are kind of the victory for me.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: I just wanted to clarify, on the comments with respect to guidance, and how China fits in, I think Calvin you said China utilization or growth slowed in 1Q as you had called out previously, if that -- if the current level of China growth would hold or persist for the rest of the year, is there still a way for you to get to the upper end of your guidance assuming no quota, in other words, how dependent on China with where your run rate is now with your latest data point to hit the upper end of your guidance?
Gary Guthart: No, I think it’d be possible, again I think we are calling for some moderation in China and just order of magnitude right, the U.S. business, general surgeries are largest category in the U.S. gynecology is the large set of procedures and that mature category is urology, so I think those just have larger basis of business that kind of things impact and then we’re going to have a bigger impact at least on this year in terms of the growth rates.
Richard Newitter: And maybe just one follow-up on an earlier question on bariatric, one of the things that we continue to see in this market is the adoption of Sleeve gastrectomy, at the expense of gastric bypass, and I was just wondering are you guys feeling like the application of robot has a bigger appeal or a bigger unmet need in either one of those two and can succeed if the world goes the way of sleeve gastrectomy?
Gary Guthart: I understand the question right the difference in suturing is a lot in terms of the amount of suturing between those two. I think it’s too soon to tell right now what kind of the value statements are going to be in bariatric surgery over time, so like I said I think there’s some core interest here, the procedures are taxing on surgeons, they’re demanding procedure, and there are differences between those two techniques, I think stay tuned is really the short answer here, we will let it play out over the next few quarters and report back. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. 
Rick Wise: Good afternoon, Gary. And thanks for the awesome quarter. Just two questions from me. Maybe just a little more color for hernia adoption, for hernia outlook. Obviously continues to go great. Just curious from your perspective, what aiming do you think we are in terms of robotic adoption. How sustainable is this kind of growth you're seeing over the next few years? And maybe a little color on, I assume largely driven by incisional at this point, or is the inguinal catching up. Can you just help us reflect on the drivers as you looked out over the next few years?
Gary Guthart: Sure. This is Gary. I think we're still in the early part of the game, I don't know exactly what inning and whether there'll be extra innings or not. But it we're not in the first innings, it's now becoming evaluated fairly broadly. Inguinal has been the primary driver in the hernia space to date. We think incisional hernias are also an opportunity and that may rise in the future relative to inguinal. So far so good. We look at of course clinical publications and presentations and value statements as reported by clinicians. We also look at reorder patterns and use, are they trialing or are they sticking with it. And so far, the performance in terms of ongoing use and sticking, stickiness, sticking with the procedure once they've tried it is quite good in inguinal hernia repair and that's a good sign for us. So, we think we bring real value here. And customers came to report back as much. We look forward to the next several quarters. 
Rick Wise: Yeah. And just last for me Gary, you have been kind enough in the past to be I think very frank and direct about the looming competition. And just I'll be curious to hear your latest thoughts. The two larger companies since we last spoke in this kind of context. One of the competitors seems to be delayed. You now have a smaller competitor approved in U.S. and in Europe. Just curious how all this is changing reflecting the market or selling discussions. Is it slowing down or it is a positive they're slow down. Again, any updated perspective will be very welcome. Thanks again. 
Gary Guthart: Yeah, as we said before, I think that need is clear. And I think that the opportunity afforded by the kind of the core technologies that are available are also clear now have become clear. I think customers are always interested in choice. We can provide them choice within our ecosystem, but they'll look for choice outside that ecosystem also. And I anticipate it, in my response customers when they ask is they should evaluate the alternatives. I guess what I would say is the hardest thing to compete with is the power points that don't yet exist in a product and the concepts that can't really be evaluated.  I think in general, the existence of competition validates the space. I think that it signals to surgical societies the broader acceptance of the concept itself I think that's generally positive. I think these organizations out there that are large and small all of that staffed by capable people. And I think that they're going to work hard and look at alternatives. And to the extent that they come up with some really strong ones. I think that will change what’s happening at our customer base but so far so good.  I haven’t seen product concepts so far that Intuitive hasn’t either considered and built or considered and consciously passed on. It doesn’t mean that we’re not wrong, we could be. But I feel like we have a good team. I think our team thinks about the problems holistically and from the customers’ perspective. And if we continue to do that, I think we will be well positioned vis-à-vis competition. 
Operator: And last question will come from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Isaac Ro: Thanks. Good afternoon. I appreciate that. So quick follow up on the outlook in Asia specifically Japan and China. So, in Japan, are you expecting any meaningfully uptick in systems placements with a new reimbursement in place? And the reason for asking is it seems that you had a fair amount of what I would call idle capacity for existing placements prior to the updated reimbursement. So, I am wondering if you'd help us map back what the new reimbursement means to incremental system demand.
Gary Guthart: Yes, I mean, we mentioned in our comments, Isaac. We are expecting it will probably modest. We have got nearly 300 systems in Japan currently. And so, I think there’s a lot of capacity that can be applied to this new set of procedures. These set of procedures can involve a process here of bringing up the teams and going through training and they are gradually building as we gain experience and confidence. So, I don’t think there’s going to be a tremendous need to expand capacity here in the early days.  It is true that some of these new procedures and they in the general surgery and thoracic categories can definitely benefit from our fourth-generation technology, Xi technology, there will be some interest on the part of some folks to upgrade to the newer models. But for us right now I think it’s really about building a foundation clinically in the market and like we always say, eventually the capital will follow but we are not predicting anything too dramatic this year. 
Isaac Ro: Okay, thank you. And then I am trying to follow up there. It sounds to us like that there will be hopefully some kind of update at the federal or national level with essentially a number if you will for new quota. But can you help us think through your understanding of how that number will then disseminate to the prudential [ph] level and eventually convert to origin revenue, whether it be the order process, how it varies, timeline, anything to help us understand the translation of the quota to actual action. 
Gary Guthart: It’s a negotiation that occurs between Central Government and the provinces, so we are not permitted that negotiation and I don’t really understand or know what the time table is. I can tell you that last time the quota was approved that it took several quarters for it to translate into any kind of sale to us. So, if you recall the quote last quarter we got was around 2013 and yet we saw most of systems at the end of 2015. So, you go through that negotiation between Central Government and provinces and then you also then have a tender process with each hospital at the end of it and that takes time.
Gary Guthart: Alright. Well that was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma.  We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure that we remain committed to driving the lot of few things that should make a difference.  This concludes today’s call. I thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improved surgery and we look forward to talking to you again in three months.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 6, 2017 and 10-Q filed on October 20, 2017. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results, and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our financial outlook for 2018 and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary. 
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. As you know, Intuitive is dedicated to the mission of expanding the availability of minimally invasive surgery, increasing its efficacy and decreasing its invasiveness. The fourth quarter completed a solid year in pursuit of this mission. During the year we made progress in several areas including accelerated use of our system and the related growth in our installed base along with the achievement of significant milestones in variable market access and product development. While we're pleased with our progress in the year, the opportunity for improvement in surgery is substantial and much work remains to be done.  Global procedure growth was strong at approximately 17% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year. Growth patterns and procedures were largely consistent through the year with increased use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, continued growth in neurology in Europe and Japan and multispecialty growth in Korea and China.  General surgery growth was led by hernia repair and colon section, while mature procedures in the United States particularly across the discectomy outperformed our expectations predominantly due to macro trends in the prostate cancer market.  Procedure growth in several countries including Germany, Korea and China was healthy through the year and adoption in Japan was solid for those procedures that have been reimbursed. This month the Ministry of Health in Japan listed for reimbursement 12 procedures, in which da Vinci could be used in addition to Prostatectomy and nephrectomy which are already reimbursed. While this is clearly a positive step regarding interest in da Vinci procedures in Japan. The final level of reimbursement has not been communicated. Calvin will review procedure trends and Marshall our progress in Japan in greater detail later in the call.  Turning to capital placements, we expanded our da Vinci system offering this year with the launch of our da Vinci X surgical system. A response to customer need. da Vinci X delivers our fourth-generation robotics, imaging and fully articulated instrumentation and attractive entry price and procedure capability with logical upgrade pathways. Reception to the 2x has been positive, catalyzing interest in robotics programs in price sensitive markets.  Taken together, our generation four products da Vince X, da Vince XI and our future da Vince SP, which is not yet cleared represent a balance and upgradable portfolio of choices for customers building or extending the robotic surgery programs. Overall our capital placement performance in 2017 accelerated relevant to 2016. With growth in total placements rising 27% from 537 in 2016 to 684 in 2017.  Net of trade ins and retirements, our da Vinci install base grew 13% over 2016 from 3,919 to 4,409. U.S. capital placements stood out in the year and the fourth quarter largely driven by growth in general surgery. European placement performance in the fourth quarter was strong, placements in the fourth quarter in Japan were also healthy perhaps a one-time uptick in anticipation of broader reimbursement. Capital placements overall has been lumpy and we anticipate volatility in placements in 2018.  Operating performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year exceeded our expectations with strong performance in manufacturing efficiency, product quality and cost reduction projects and with average selling prices as expected.  Investments to deepen our original capabilities and to develop new technologies and services were important in the past year. As our business strengthen we increased some investments through 2017 to strengthen our corporate infrastructure and position us to benefit from increased scale.  Turning to highlights of our fourth quarter operating results. Procedures grew approximately 17% over the fourth quarter of last year, we shifted 216 da Vinci surgical systems up from a 163 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter was $892 million up 18%, proforma gross profit margin was 72.3% compared to 71.1% in the fourth quarter last year.  Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $457 million up 18%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $618 million representing 69% of total revenue. We generated a proforma operating profit of $384 million in the quarter up 20% from the fourth quarter of last year.  Proforma net income was $298 million up 23% and we concluded our accelerated share buyback program initiated in Q1 of 2017 our weighted average price of $310 per share.  Highlights of the full year 2017 are as follows. Procedure grew approximately 16% over 2016, we installed 684 systems in 2017, up from 537 in 2016. Revenue for the year was $3.1 billion up 16%.  Pro forma gross margin was 71.9% for the full year compared to 71.6% for 2016. Total recurring revenue for the year was $2.2 billion representing 72% of total revenue. Pro forma operating profit for the year was $1.3 billion up 13.1% from 2016 and pro forma net income was $1 billion up 19%. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly. While Intuitive completed its 22nd year in 2017, I firmly believe that computer system medical advancements are in their infancy. A careful read of the clinical literature makes clear the need for more effective, less invasive and lower total cost to treat solutions to many disease states. The rise of robotic technology, powerful computing, improved sensing, micro fabrication and molecular imaging enable new approaches to old problems. We have been investing in improvements both incremental and revolutionary towards the same and anticipate continuing this investment trajectory in 2018. The opportunity to improve surgery using advanced technologies is now recognized broadly and we anticipate the entry of additional competitive systems into some regions of the world over the next several quarters, customers appreciate choice and it is possible that sales cycles lengthen in some countries as customers evaluate more options. Our company is anticipating increased competition and we are focused on understanding the market’s needs and selling and delivering products and services today and in the future, that meet them.  Turning to our da Vinci Sp system, we submitted our 510(k) for urology last month. We call as Sp as a platform technology that allows high dexterity access with great 3D vision to confined surgical spaces. As we’ve discussed on prior calls, we plan first markets to include urologic surgery, head and neck surgery and colorectal surgery. In 2017, Sp was used in human trials in United States and Hong Kong completing case spanning initial target procedures. We anticipate a phased launch of Sp in 2018 pending clearance.  We are also making good progress on our flexible robotics platform, first targeted to address the acute need in diagnosis of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection is important.  Our program hit its milestones in 2017 completing its first clinical experience in Australia. Preliminary results were reported at the CHEST Conference in Q4 of 2017. Feedback from physicians evaluating our technology relative to existing and emerging alternatives has been strongly supportive of our efforts. Our design and operations teams are working hard to incorporate feedback, complete its production design and supply chain optimization and complete validations for regulatory submissions. We do not expect revenue from our flexible robotics program in 2018. Our fourth-generation product platform has enabled greater access to our legacy advanced instruments. Used in satisfaction with our stapling and imaging products has been rising as gen four products have increased in the installed base. Both stapling and imaging instruments are important to surgeons and we’ve been investing in broadening our product line and incorporating customer feedback in both areas. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we submitted our 510(k) applications for our 60-millimeter stapler for da Vinci X and Xi.  Lastly, our imaging teams continue to explore new ways to identify tissue including good progress in our molecular imaging program as well as improvements to our endoscopes and image processing algorithms. We have been introducing improvements in our imaging hardware routinely and expect to continue to do so in 2018.  Molecular imaging agents are long-term investments. We expect our lead agent to enter Phase 2 trials in 2018. In closing, as we start 2018, our focus remains in completing the task we’ve set for ourselves. First, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery. Second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia. Third, advancing our new platforms, imaging advanced instruments da Vinci SP and our diagnostic platform and finally support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region.  I'll now turn the call over the Marshall, who'll review financial highlights. 
Marshall Mohr: Good afternoon. Overall our fourth quarter financial performance was strong. I will start by describing highlights of this performance on a GAAP and non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also take you through our analysis of the impact of key U.S. 2017 tax cuts and jobs act on our financial results. As a reminder, our results are also posted on our website.  Consistent with our preliminary press release on January 10, fourth quarter 2017 revenue was $192 million an increase of 18% compared with $757 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and increase of 11% compared with third quarter revenue of $806 million. In the fourth quarter we completed the da Vinci X tradeoff program offered to certain first quarter customers. The impact of this program was to increase fourth quarter revenue by approximately $2 million and third quarter revenue by approximately $21 million.  As mentioned earlier in the call, fourth quarter 2017 procedures increased approximately 17%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased 12% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. in the neurology worldwide. Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call.  Instrument and accessory revenue of $457 million increased 18% compared with the last year which is slightly higher than procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,910 which is relatively unchanged compared to last year, reflecting increased advanced instrument usage mostly offset by customer buying patterns.  Systems revenue of $283 million increased 20% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily reflecting higher system placements. We placed 216 systems in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 163 systems in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 169 systems last quarter. 40 systems replaced under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 13 systems in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Systems placed under operating leases represented 19% of systems placements compared with 8% last year. Our installed base of da Vinci systems ended the year of 4409 systems up 13% year-over-year. Consistent with recent trends, average system utilization continues to grow in the mid-single digit range.  Globally our average selling price which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts and revenue deferrals was approximately $1.47 million, which is similar to the fourth quarter of 2016 and the same as last quarter. 51 or 24% of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci X systems compared with 16 or 9% of systems last quarter.  We are seeing demand for da Vinci X from cost sensitive customers as well as customers switching to upgrade to or standardize on our fourth-generation technology. We believe that flexible financial programs like operating leases have allowed us to be more agile in meeting customer needs for systems. While the number of leases is difficult to predict in the short term, we expect the proportion of these types of arrangements will increase overtime.  Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Fourth quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $248 million increased 17% compared with both the fourth quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017.  OUS procedures grew approximately 21% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Outside the US, we placed 86 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 63 in the fourth quarter of 2016, and 62 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 47 in the Europe and 22 in Japan. 25 of the 47 systems placed in Europe, were X systems. Placements outside of the US will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations.  As Gary indicated, a committee of MHLW in Japan has recommended 12 procedures for reimbursement. It is anticipated that by the end of this quarter MHLW will determine the reimbursement levels for each procedure. The applicable opportunity for da Vinci surgery within this set of procedures is difficult to estimate at this time due to the uncertainty in reimbursement levels as well as the perceived value of da Vinci relative to alternative surgical approaches.  With nearly 300 systems installed in Japan, the level of system expansion over the year or so, over the next year or so is difficult to predict. We expect system expansion in Japan to be modest in 2018.  Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 72.3% compared with 71.1% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 71.8% for the third quarter of 2017. The increase compared with the third quarter primarily reflects lower manufacturing cost, partially offset by seasonally higher proportion of systems revenue.  Future margins will also fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mixed subsystems in instrument and accessory revenue system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product costs, and improve manufacturing efficiency. Pro forma operating expenses increased 19% compared with the fourth quarter 2016 an increased 13% compared with last quarter. The increase compared with the third quarter reflects increased variable compensation. Our spending was consistent with our plan reflecting investments in da Vinci SP, catheter-based robotics, imaging in advanced instrumentation and expansion of our OUS markets.  These investments involved multiyear commitments. Our pro forma effective tax rates for the fourth quarter was 24.9% compared with our expectations of 26.5% to 28.5%. Now I will take you through the items included in our GAAP tax rate, including impacts of the US tax act in a minute.  Our tax rates will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S and OUS income changes in tax rates made by local authorities and with the impact of one-time items. Our fourth quarter 2017 pro forma net income was $298 million or $2.57 per share compared with $242 million or $2.03 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $324 million or $2.77 per share for the third quarter of 2017. All per share amounts reflects the three for one stock split affected in October. Third quarter 2017 GAAP and pro forma net income per diluted share benefited by $0.9 per share from the recognition of $21 million of deferred revenue net of costs and income tax and by $0.59 per share related to the tax reserve reversal of $68 million.  I’ll now summarize our GAAP results. Inclusive of the impacts of the US Tax Act, we incurred a GAAP net loss of $39 million or $0.35 per share for the fourth quarter 2017 compared with GAAP net income of $204 million or $1.71 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, a GAAP net income of $298 million or $2.55 per share for the third quarter of 2017. The following items are excluded from our fourth quarter pro forma net income but included in our GAAP net loss; $270 million or $2.41 per share reflecting a 14% one-time tax for historical OUS earnings and profits under the US Tax Act; $48 million or $0.42 per share for the write-down of net deferred asset to reflect the reduction in corporate tax rate under the US Tax Act; $20 million or $0.18 per share of excess tax benefits associated with employee stock rewards; and $57 million of net charges or $0.51 per share associated with employee equity charges, IP charges and legal settlements. Note that the IRS has not issued final tax rate regulations associated with the recent US tax legislation. Therefore, impacts of the US Tax Act reflected in our fourth quarter results and our projection of future tax rates represent our best estimates of the impact of the US Tax Act and could change as tax regulations are finalized and interpreted. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.8 billion, approximately the same as at September 30, 2017. During the quarter, cash generated from operations were mostly offset by a final payment of $274 million associated with the accelerated share repurchase agreement we entered in the first quarter. Under that agreement we purchased 7.3 million shares at approximately $310 per share. We have approximately 718 million remaining under the Board buyback authorization.  As a result of the 2017 Tax Act we have the option to repatriate OUS cash with minimal tax impact. We have significant opportunity for growth outside of the US. We will evaluate the need to repatriate cash relative to our business and overall environment overtime.  And with that, I would like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2018.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was 17% compared to 15% during the fourth quarter of 2016 and 15% last quarter. Our Q4 procedure growth was driven by strong results globally and 16% growth in US procedures reflecting broad-based strength across our procedure categories.  Q4 likely benefited modestly from cases deferred out of Q3 due to hurricanes. In total, approximately 877,000 of entry procedures are performed in 2017, up about 16% for the year. In the US general surgery on a run rate basis has surpassed gynecology as our largest specialty. Approximately 246,000 US general surgery procedures were performed in 2017, up 32% compared to 2016. 2017 growth was again driven by hernia repair, ventral and inguinal combined which continued to drive the most incremental cases, and continued da Vinci adoption in colorectal procedures.  Early stage adoption and bariatric procedures and growth across the general surgery category also contributed to growth.  In U.S. gynecology, fourth quarter and full year 2017 procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth led by hysterectomy. We continue to see an increasing proportion of U.S. gynecology procedures being performed by physicians that specialized in complex benign and cancer surgery who tend to be uses of da Vinci systems. U.S. urology procedures exceeded our expectations for the fourth quarter and the year driven by proctectomy volumes. As the mature procedure category, we believe that our US proctectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, which has benefitted from recent macro trends.  In other U.S. procedures, adoption of lobectomy and other thoracic procedures was again strong during the fourth quarter and full year. This set of procedures is particularly well served by our da Vinci XI system and surgical staplers. Outside the United States, approximately 233,000 procedures were performed in 2017 up approximately 21% in the fourth quarter and approximately 23% for the full year. Growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures and earlier stage growth in general surgery and gynecology.  Fourth quarter all U.S. procedure growth was slightly lower, largely reflecting leveling system utilization and moderating growth in China as we anticipate future system sales quota.  The value proposition regarding any da Vinci procedure is based upon the differentiated clinical value that can be offered to clinicians compared to other treatment alternatives including economic factors. Since the introduction of the da Vinci system, over 15,000 clinical papers have been published involving da Vinci surgery including approximately 2300 in 2017 alone.  As I mentioned in my procedure discussion, long procedures in the U.S. have contributed to recent procedure growth. In November 2017, a team of investigators from the University of Southern California, the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Penn State Health, and Intuitive published a large-scale study titled Robotic-Assisted, Video-Assisted Thoracic and Open Lobectomy: Propensity Matched Analysis of Recent Premiere Data in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery.  In this study, the premier healthcare database was analyzed for open video assisted thoracic or VATS and Robotic assisted lobectomies performed between January 1, 2011 and September 30, 2015. The results from this study show a continued increase in the number of robotic assisted lobectomies during the study period. The combined total of robotic assisted and VATS approaches accounted for more than half of the lobectomies in the U.S. database indicating a strong trend towards adoption of minimally invasive approaches. While the proportion of VATS remains virtually unchanged during the study period, the robotic rate grew as open declined.  After propensity score matching, which controls for heterogeneity of patients in hospitals, the robotic assisted cases were compared to VATS procedures and a sample size of 2775 in each group and robotic assisted cases were compared to open with 2951 patients in each group. Compared to open surgery, robotic assisted lobectomy demonstrated statistically significant lower post-operative complication rate, shorter hospital stay, higher percentage of patients discharged to home and lower hospital mortality rate.  Compared to VATS robotic assisted surgery demonstrated statistically significant lower rate of conversion to thoracotomy, lower post-operative complication rate, shorter hospital stays and a higher percentage of patients discharged to home. As we've said in the past, we continue to invest in clinical research in our key geographic markets to assess da Vinci surgery outcomes and help educate the market. We support large scale data registries, including those managed by the American Hernia Society Quality Collaborative, and the Society of Gynecological Oncology clinical outcomes registry.  As large da Vinci data sets accumulate in these registries and are compared to baseline results, the value of the da Vinci surgery can be evaluated. We also support clinical research grants at sages AFTRs and the European Colo. Proctology society as well as da Vinci fellowship programs, with several surgical societies which often yield clinical studies.  I will now turn for our financial outlook for 2018. Starting with procedures, as described in our announcement earlier this month, 20 17 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 16% to roughly 877,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2018 we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 11% to 15%. We expect 2018 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside of the United States, where we're still in earlier stages of adoption.  We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2018 as we've experienced in previous years, with Q1being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. In Q1, we expect a modest procedure headwind compared to Q1 2017, as a result of our estimates of working days, mostly due to the timing of the Good Friday holiday.  With respect to revenue, as we've mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure growth, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including U.S, healthcare policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, and competitive factors. Within this framework, we'd expect 2018 capital placement seasonality to generally follow historical patterns by quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2017, 40 of the 216 system shift or 19% were under operating leases. In 2018, we'd expect the proportion of systems placed under operating leases to trend modestly up from there with variation by quarter.  Turning to gross profit, our full year 2017 gross pro forma gross profit margin was 71.9%. In 2018,  we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71.5% net revenue. We are projecting a modestly lower gross profit margin in 2018 reflecting higher costs associated with new products, our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter to quarter depending largely on product and regional mix.  Turning to operating expenses. As Gary and Marshal described in 2018 we will continue to make substantive investments in several strategic areas that are poised to benefit the company over the long run. As a result, we expect to grow 2018 pro forma operating expenses between 16% and 18% above 2017 levels. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between 225 million and 235 million in 2018 compared to 209 million in 2017. We expect the other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between 45 million and 55 million in 2018. With regards to income tax, incorporating projected impacts of the new US tax law we expect our 2018 pro forma income tax rate to be between 20% and 2% of pre-tax income. Note that in the future if the IRS issues additional guidance and interpretation of the new tax law, our estimated rate may be impacted. Our share count for calculated diluted EPS pro forma EPS in Q4 was 117.4 million shares. In Q1, we expect our diluted share count to range between 117.6 million and 118.4 million shares. The actually diluted share count will depend on several factors including share price. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question today comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: Thanks very much. Appreciate the opportunity to ask a few questions here. So, may be just to start out on the product side. Just want to make sure I have a good sense for what you’re saying. So here I guess on the flexible endoscope platform I realized you said no revenues in 2018. But is there a scenario where you have any regulatory approvals for flexible endoscope in any major country may be towards to the end of 2018?
Gary Guthart: Hi, Bob. We are not calling the clearance date yet of the flex platform. I am pleased with where we are. We are working to plan. Our tradition with you has been to let you know when we do a submission and that gives us a little bit better estimate of timelines and I rather than a guess in this setting. So, we are feeling good about it but I don’t have a date for you yet.
Bob Hopkins: Okay. Feeling good about it, does that mean the potential for submissions in ‘18?
Gary Guthart: No, I am feeling good about the progress of the team and their ability to deliver on what we think this is capable of doing.
Bob Hopkins: Okay. And then on your comments on Japan. I am just curious, what do you assume for Japan in the current 11% to 15%? And may be said another way if reimbursement comes into way you would hope, does that suggest the potential for the higher end of that 11% to 15%?
Gary Guthart: We haven’t baked a lot of growth in there. Again, we don’t really know at this point what the reimbursement levels are going to be and therefore that could vastly impact the number of the procedure adoption curve. So, there is no lot in there but even then, the magnitude of Japan relative to the total world is not substantial. And the highest growth drivers for the -- for us for next year really are general surgery procedures in US and urologic procedures outside of the US.
Gary Guthart: And with these clearances Bob, our reimbursement I should say -- it really is going to be building a foundation time for us. There’s going to be large investments made or we have been making and we’re going to follow through on things like training surgeons and building the teams up to speed. So, it’s really more about building a foundation here for the future in 2018 than substantive contribution to the growth. 
Bob Hopkins: And then Gary just real quickly. Given the success you’ve had as a company in 2017 on the procedure side I want to ask one quick question on how you view the market opportunity. Because in 2016 and 2017 your slide decks talked about 4 million accessible procedures worldwide for proved technologies. And I'm just curious if you could update us on your latest thoughts on kind of the adjustable procedures, where you stand today relative to that 4 million. Given that you guide SPE coming along with obviously other technologies. 
Gary Guthart: Fair question. As you described, I think for current products in the market and current countries in which we operate, I think our estimates that we're not yet recorded penetrated. So even with what our commercial teams have to do, we have plenty of upside. I think as you move whenever you talked about full available market, I'll tell you how we think about it. We look at how start with, where do we see differentiated clinical value by procedure given what we can bring and try to get an estimate of what segment or population of our customer base that can make a positive impact.  And we, you know us start conservatively. And what tends to happen overtime as we get into those history has been that as we get clinical data and our customers use our products we get a better clear view of TAM. Often the TAM has increased, not always some TAMs have decreased but mostly they've increased. And so that's how we look at it.  SP is clearly an opportunity for us to explore some procedures and patient populations that we have not gone a lot. And that I think is why we're excited about it. And Flex, I think opens a new set of opportunities for us, that's why we have done the investments. I think flexible technology we are pursuing in the pulmonology space and the thoracic cavity. And we'll be focused on that for the next few years. But as you know we really excited about platform ideas. Things that have generic capability that can be broadened overtime, and we think flex robotics diagnostics and other interventions can do that as well.  We don't have a crystal ball as to those TAMs and we're not ready yet to describe how big we think they can be in part because our estimates are large ranges could be quite a lot of variability. But we invest in them because they think they bring the real opportunities for outcome improvements in the hands of customers, decreases in variability across the customer base, and as a result an opportunity to grow the footprint of Intuitive going forward. 
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
David Lewis : Good afternoon. Few quick questions from me. First Gary, just coming back to the pipeline. Just on SP is there are change we get additional level approvals or submissions for head and neck and colorectal this year on SP. And is second half of the year a decent timeframe to think about the 40-millimeter stapler approval?
Gary Guthart: So, let's go to the -- I think you meant 60-millimeter stapler. On the SP front, not ready to call timing on labeling in case additional indications were pursued and with FDA overtime. And it depends a lot on what kind of data requirements we have and how that conversations goes. We're focused right now on the first one.  In terms of clinical capability and customer feedback, we're feeling quite positive. And so, I think the conversation with FDA should be pretty direct and grounded predicting the timeline we are not ready to do yet at this time.  On the 60 millimeters, that’s a set of products that we have gone back and forth over the years with approvals. I don’t think its wildly different in terms of what we can expect and I think historical timelines for approvals for us are probably good predictors of what happens on the 60 millimeters. so, I am hopeful that we will see it this year. 
David Lewis : Okay. And just a couple more for me, Gary, just one on spending, I think you are wisely investing away some of the tax benefit, but you know, year-on-year it's probably $150 of incremental OpEx and $50 million more than we expected for 2018. If you could just sort of give us a sense of where some of the key investment dollars are going here in 2018 and then you mentioned this last quarter but not this quarter, in terms of hiring the management team for the China JV, where are you on CEO, CFO and what are their near-term priorities? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Fair question. On the investment side as the business has strengthened over the last couple of years, we've increased our investments. I think rationally they have been focused on a couple of things. One has been a building depth in OUS markets are our market presence and penetration in places like Japan and China and Germany, France, UK and so on are less than they are in the U.S. We think there's real opportunity for value creation in those markets, and we want to make sure that we're not under investing there relative to the opportunities. So that's one segment.  The next segment is, I really believe, computer assisted surgery, I think has moved from an interesting, part of minimally invasive surgery department to a kind of an essential part of the portfolio. And as that happens, I think more and more opportunities, competitors and interest is being generated and we want to make sure that Intuitive is investing for the long-term and, I think you all will hold us to the quality of those investments. Mostly the challenge here has not been identifying opportunity, it's been making sure that we invest in something that we have the skill and capability to deliver it with excellence. And so, we've been, we've been, investing behind things that we think are good opportunities. And I think over time, the wisdom of those decisions will play out. So that's, kind of mark.  I think the last thing for us has been the business has accelerated. We see opportunities for taking advantage of scale and efficiency and we think that will serve the company well and our customer base well in the future. So as volumes go up we can convert some capital investments into operating efficiency. You've seen us doing that and I think that allows us to share with the customer, some of those efficiencies, it drives better quality performance and our products. We think that's important as well. And so, as we've seen strengthening, we've, loosened some of those dollars and I have to thank our operations team who've done a beautiful job investing them wisely.  Marshall, I want you to take the JV and China question and I'll fill in behind. 
Marshall Mohr: Sure, in China we have hired a CEO, we actually also hired the CFO and a few other key members of the management team. Right now, they are focused on building out that management team and getting prepared for eventual launch of the business itself.  Of course, the gating factor there is, we're still working on the development of the catheter-based product here in the United States and as that's completed, then elements of it and the business will start to be handed over to the JV.
Gary Guthart: The early performance of that team as they’ve entered the organization is encouraging. The human capital that they were bringing to the Board was pretty strong. So that has been a positive set for us in ‘17.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I guess first question on Japan, I know you don’t want to comment on reimbursement levels at this point, it’s a bit of wind game here. But if we think about the 12 procedures that you got approval for, are there ones you want to call out that may be more are more exciting than others and may be could you talk about what percentages of those are done open versus lab of 12 that have been approved?
Gary Guthart: Well it’s hard to characterize which ones are most excited about when you don’t know what reimbursements are going to be. So, you’ve seen the list and I think you can size yourself what you think the market opportunity might be. But I again caution you that until reimbursements are announced, we’re really not going to know.  And as Calvin said, there is also an element of adoption in terms of -- that will take place in terms of building out the sales force, building training capabilities and so forth.  There’s also the -- as I said in my script, there is the alternate surgical approaches that may be used that you also have to deal with in adoption. So, I think once we understand reimbursement and we start to dig into a little bit more after April 1st is when we’ll know that, maybe we can start to talk a little bit more about the specific procedures.
Calvin Darling: For me just looking at the clinical side, I think there are a few things that are pretty exciting in the underlying dynamic and conversations that the surgical societies have been having. First, Marshall had mentioned that laparoscopy is fairly penetrated in some of the markets in Japan, the laparoscopic surgeons are quite capable and skilled in that market and yet we continue to have quite interest in use of our technologies there.  And I think that’s a positive development for us. It indicates that they are looking for clinical improvements and tool improvements overtime. And so, things like hysterectomy I think are interesting for us. Hard for us to predict exactly what will happen. It’s a highly penetrated laparoscopic procedure with very skilled surgeons in Japan and yet the interest is quite high and that was one of the things that we study pretty deeply. And so, I personally am excited to see how that unfolds overtime.  It will change -- as to Bob Hopkins' earlier question, how do you think about Japan, Japan is a great example of thinking through how do you do these stamp calculations, because we'll see what the mix is with regard to laparoscopy versus robotics. But I am excited to see how that unfolds.  There are thoracic opportunities in the reimbursement as well and other things like GYN oncology. So, I think there are several things in there that in mid to long-term I think will be really exciting for us and Japan. I think the Japanese surgical societies and Japanese surgeons are thoughtful and deep and that will be a great market to serve.  The one caution you’ve heard us say several times is that it’s more than reimbursement. We have to have the technology, training and resources in place, the proper network flow we build overtime, our sales team has to get deep with the customer.  And so, the near term, there is some hard work and fleet rolling to do. That would not diminish my enthusiasm for the long-term.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, that’s helpful. And then a question on older systems, kind of two parts here. One you had a bit all U.S. trade in number. Was that just function of the end of the X trading program. And then you're still selling a number of SI systems I think it was 20 this quarter. Why are customers opting to that versus the X. 
Gary Guthart: So, it's less than first, for SI products, there are countries where we did not yet have regulatory approval for X. And therefore, we're still selling SIs. There are also some customers have SIs already and they don't want yet to move away from move into with a world where they have two sets of inventories and two sets of per training protocol and so forth. And so, they would rather step into an SI. And then there are some countries where reimbursements are not so high and they're looking for achieve -- and a SI -- fits that bill. But you probably will see the number of SIs we sale declined overtime going forward. As we get regulatory approvals and we're able to move Xs. 
Marshall Mohr: Yeah on the system retirement side, I think there were 21 total, 18 retired in the field plus 3 that were lease returned. It's been higher than we've been running. But it's really an expected part of our business cycle. And as you know when a customer elects to stop using a particular system they're really going to trade it in, purchase a new system or just to hire it up there in the field. And most of them end up being traded in but some end up being retired in the field and we saw that. In Q4, we're able to confirm that there were 18 of these 4400 in the field mostly older models, that were no longer to be used. So, we just removed them from our installed base count. 
Gary Guthart: Yeah, you were also asking about Europe and trade ins in Europe, is that correct?
Tycho Peterson: Yes. 
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Trade ins in Europe even despite what I said about some customers want, don't want to enter into a world where they have two sets of inventories. There are those customers that want to standardize in the fourth-generation product. And there is also a larger installed base as Xs and SIs in Europe and in terms of mix relative to as I've said in the United States. And so, we can see a number of customers in Europe trade out their SIs for X part. So, to get into the fourth-generation product and have access into the latest instrumentation. 
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then last one, thinking about the mature procedures in particularly dVP in the U.S. Anything in the '18 that would change the trajectory of relative to what you saw in '17. I think you've kind a mentioned you're back to kind of the market growth rate there. but just curious. I mean I think there has been this expectation that it will decelerate a little bit for a while. Curious as your thoughts. 
Gary Guthart: Yeah, I mean the results in 2017 exceeded our expectation. Urology was up 8% for the year, and dVP was a piece of that. So as kind the standard for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer, we think we'll be moving with the overall incidence rate which is more likely low single digits. So, our expectation within our guidance at the low end and the high end is some moderation in the U.S. on across the -- in 2018.
Operator: And do we have a question from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Faro. Please go ahead. 
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon thanks for taking the questions guys. One on China and one on the flex catheter and just on the tax rate as well. So, on the Chinese quota, where you guys are in the process there. if you have any visibility and if it's too late at this point to impact 2018. On the flex catheter Gary, it's on the last call, you sounded maybe optimistic that the chest data would be enough for FDA clearing in the U.S. Do you have confirmation of that at this point or any clarification?  And just lastly, Marshal on the tax rate. I thought it would be a little bit lower than 20% to 22%, is there some conservatism there, you know, given the uncertainty or is there something else that we maybe didn't factor into some of the estimates we had. Thanks for taking the questions guys.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, you wanted to take that first one Marshall. 
Marshall Mohr: There is no news on the quota. I mean we sit here waiting as we do for news as to, as to what the quota will be. On, China, we don't have any indication that is either A, Intuitive specific or something that we should be foundationally worried about. So, we're not looking at it and thinking something's wrong here or there's an Intuitive specific indication, nothing works like that. You asked the question is that too late to impact 2018, I don't think so yet. Marshall looking at you, I don't know how you feel about it. 
Gary Guthart: It's hard to know how long the tender process will take at the hospitals, last time we got a quota approved, quota was approved in 2013 and we didn't see it many of the systems sold until the end of 2015. I don't know whether that, whether that same timeline will apply here. 
Marshall Mohr: Moving to the flex question, no change in my opinion about data requirements either way, I wouldn't read anything in my comments last time or this time, would indicate a change. And go to tax. 
Gary Guthart: The tax rate the range that Calvin gave it our best estimate, you’ve said that you thought it would have been lower, clearly, a greater portion of our revenue is still generated in the United States. So more at the higher end. There are, you know, there's the rate itself, the 21%, but then there are other elements of the tax stack that add additional taxation on top of that. And so, we've given you the range that we think will, is the best estimate of what it is. I don't, I wouldn't call it conservative. 
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Hey, good afternoon. Let me start with gross margin guidance. Since last two years you've kind of been nearing that 72% range, effect is now kind of in your favor. You had pretty big -- year last year at lower margin. You kind of implying that might not repeat again in 2018, which is understandable. I think it was very little revenues from new products, I guess, but here at, as you're talking about how we should think about that ramp, so why shouldn't that gross margin number at the very least stay consistent with 2017 if not go up a bit? 
Gary Guthart: Yeah, I think like we said in the prepared comments Amit, the primary driver there is going to be impact of new products and we are going to do a phase launch of a SPs so we can experience [ph] there and 60 millimeters like we talked about. You have the direct margin on the products, but there's investments we make in the lines and the teams and the kind of the structure to make these things that kind of run through on a cost line, all that runs ahead of the higher revenue amount.
Amit Hazan: And then just a follow-up on the U.S. trade in. I'm kind of looking at the year, maybe a little bit surprised, how I think trade ins ended the year in the U.S. market, actually down 50 units year-over-year below even 2016 levels and I realize it's actually a positive the install ball and for procedures. But in terms of just thinking about the replacement opportunity given an aging installed base in the US, how do we best think about the next couple of years for trade-in?
Marshall Mohr: Yes, that’s -- it’s hard to estimate when the customers will get to where they want to, either standardize on fourth generation product or avail themselves to latest generation. I mean the SI drives a substantial amount of our procedures. It’s a very capable system. And in fact, even in situations where customers have suggested that they want to do a trade-in, at the end of the day they are keeping the SI for either an outpatient care meaning a point other than the surgery center or they decide that they just got volumes such as they want to keep it. So, I don’t know how to predict what the trade-in cycle will do over the next couple of years.
Gary Guthart: Directionally in terms of our intent, we think gen four is quite strong. We think X is a good product and we think we can deliver X to the installed base in attractive economic packages. And so that’s an opportunity for us. It's just really a question -- I think directionally we know where its headed, I think the question is just how long it takes? And we want to support our customers in their needs but I think we have a good offer for them.
Amit Hazan: And just last one, maybe I heard you wrong, just on imaging hardware for this year. How much more you tell us on what is expected in terms of timing of new products, is it possible to get introduced in ‘18 like augmented reality et cetera and what we might expect there in terms of potentiality?
Gary Guthart: Yes, a fair question. So, when we think about imaging, there’s three buckets that we think about investments we make. There is the hardware endoscope side, the sensors, the chips, the optics, the package. And we have been investing in that and routinely improving those things, sometimes in big steps, sometimes in small steps. Just as you would imagine, each release of cell phone has their camera systems we follow a similar idea and that’s been powerful. Those compound effects of improvements are pretty impressive.  Second thing is image processing software, the algorithms themselves to shape the image have also been improving overtime and also, we can release in patches and updates. And then there's the contrast agents and molecules. And we work all of them and we often talk about molecules, they are kind of the big thing to see. They are long-term investments. And I was reminding everybody here there are other things going on too, the hardware and the underlying software is good.  Augmented reality or mixed reality, the idea that you can take graphic images, manage them and get them in, we’re making nice progress there. I don’t expect material revenue in the year but I do think that we’ll start getting increased customer feedback over the year. And yes, we get closer to customer, we will inform you more of where we are.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Isaac Ro: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Two questions on Asia, one on China. Just curious what you guys are doing to try and drive penetration while we are waiting for the quarter, are you better off waiting for the government to give official order? Are there other avenues that you’re pursuing there to try and drive access?  And then secondly, on Japan, just appreciate all the comments you made earlier, but I am wondering how we should think about market development in that region as you get new applications, are there a couple obvious ways in which physician training and so forth need to be different and how we should think about your process there? Thank you.
Marshall Mohr: So, for China, we have a number of systems, 38 systems I think is installed there, the public cost was subject to the quota. But our distributor is driving clinical adoption there, training surgeons and moving it up, that's why you see why you heard us talk about increased utilization of those systems and increased number of procedures. The systems that are not subject to the quota really are those in the military hospitals in Hong Kong. We actually sold three systems this quarter, that's not nearly the market as the public hospitals. But nonetheless we are making progress in those markets and continue to try to drive the expansion. 
Gary Guthart: And when we think demand from Chinese surgeons and Chinese hospitals is very high. And so, education and engagement are something that we can continue to do. I'll answer to the Japan question and operator this will be our last question after that answer.  With regard to Japan, I like to quote, history doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme. I think about what we need to do in Japan in terms of market development. Our team at Japan is quite capable and are engaged deeply in communication with surgical societies around, what training pathways look like, what educational and housework ought to look like. Things like scholarship programs and so on. And so, I don't think the work is a mystery. But it does take time in education, education of our own team and education of the market.  I think we have a senior leader and our general manager in Japan. I think this is a team that's capable. So, we will give them time to make progress here, but I think I have a playbook they can work down and while it's not identical to play book that we used in the U.S. or the ones that we use in Germany. The main elements of engagement are present.  As we conclude this call, that was our last question. As we've said previously while we focused on financial metrics, such as revenues and profits and cash flow during these conference call. Our organizational focus remains on increasing value, by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. And I assure you that we remain committed to driving the bottle few things that truly make a difference.  This concludes today's call. I thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve sugary and we look forward to talking to you again in three months. 
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q3 2017 earnings release call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO, Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer and Patrick Clingan, Vice President of Finance and Sales Operations. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 6, 2017 and 10-Q filed on July 21, 2017. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results, Patrick will discuss procedure and clinical highlights, then I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2017 and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. As you know, Intuitive is focused on significantly improving surgery and enabling access to our products and services in pursuit of this mission globally. Performance in the third quarter was strong with continued growth in customers' use of our systems and an increase in system placements. Worldwide growth in procedures for the quarter was 15% over the third quarter of 2016. As we have described on prior calls, we expect growth in general surgery and countries outside the United States to continue to lead performance while procedure growth in mature categories in the United States temper. In the quarter we saw this dynamic with strength in general surgery in the U.S. and in several countries outside the U.S. lifting growth while U.S. urologic and gynecologic growth moderated. Drivers of growth include U.S. inguinal and ventral hernia repair, colon and rectal surgery and thoracic surgery as well as urology and gynecology procedures outside the United States. Procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength with solid growth in China, Japan and Korea. Overall European procedure growth moderated slightly from its first half of 2017 performance with trends varying by country. Patrick will take you through these factors in more detail later in the call. Turning to capital placement performance. The third quarter was a strong one with growth in total placements from 134 in Q3 of 169 this quarter. Customers in the United States again showed strong interest in our systems as capital placements grew quarter-over-quarter. Asia, Europe and other market system placements were roughly in line with prior quarter trends. Capital placements can be hard to forecast and we expect this lumpiness to continue given conditions in the market. Our fourth generation systems da Vinci X and da Vinci Xi continued to perform well and account for over 85% of systems placed in the quarter. Marshall and Patrick will take you through system dynamics in greater detail. Turning to probability for the quarter. Our Q3, pro forma gross margins rose slightly relative to Q2 and are slightly above our expected range for the year. This is due to strengthened procedures and improvements in our operational efficiency. Our fixed cost growth met our plan year-to-date with increases in R&D expenses, growth in staff in European and Asian markets investments in clinical trials and growth in corporate competition capabilities. Our third quarter pro forma operating results are as follows. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the third quarter of last year. We shipped 169 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 134 in the third quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter was $806 million, up 18% from the prior year which included a release of reserves related to da Vinci X trade out offers of $21 million. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $401 million, up 15%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $548 million representing 68% of total revenue. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.8% compared to 73.1% in the third quarter last year, the difference largely driven by a medical device tax refund in 2016. Pro forma operating profit was $347 million in the quarter, up 13% over Q3 of 2016. Pro forma net income was $324 million aided by one-time favorability and tax items. And lastly, we completed our three-to-one share exchange announced last quarter. Marshal will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly. Turning to operations. We believe that substantial opportunity exists to enable more minimally invasive surgery, better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. Our investments in new products and services are built on this belief. Starting with our multi-port product portfolio, recall that we have built a tiered product offering in our da Vinci systems that responds to our customers' desire of choice in content and price points while maintaining logical upgrade pathways to our leading ecosystem of robot assisted surgery products and services. We continue to bring our da Vinci X systems in new regions in the world. In the quarter, we enabled launch in nine additional countries for da Vinci X and anticipate adding four more in this fourth quarter. This set of options has been well received by our customers with da Vinci Xi making up roughly 75% of our new placements, da Vinci X making up approximately 10% of new placements in its limited early launch and with the balance made up by Si technology. We are also advancing our imaging, instruments and accessories portfolios for our generation four systems, the da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi as well as da Vinci SP. While the robotic arms are the most visible part of the surgical system, it is the performance of the whole ecosystem of robot, software, imaging, instruments and accessories in conjunction with the OR team in their working environment that creates a high functioning program. Our team is committed to understanding the total surgical environment and its workflow and design products that work seamlessly for our customers. This has motivated our investment and partnerships in technologies for imaging, stapling and more recently in advanced energy working to develop highly effective and easy-to-use total products. In the quarter, we expand the launch of two additional instruments and accessories for da Vinci X and Xi into seven different countries and initiated a limited launch of a refined vessel sealer in Europe. We anticipate that our da Vinci SP program will complete patient enrollment in surgery for its round of clinical trials this quarter. As we mentioned last call, four clinical trial sites participated, three in the United States and one in Asia. Cases in Asia included transoral, urologic and colorectal surgery, while those in the U.S. focused on transoral surgery. Our teams are finalizing product validations or working to establish manufacturing capability in support of regulatory submissions that enable launch. We plan to file our first 510(k) for the current SP designed by year-end with follow-on submissions for additional indications thereafter. For our flexible robotics program, we continue to refine product designs, develop our supply chain, finalize our regulatory strategy and initiate testing. With our partner, we are progressing and building our joint venture in China with the hire of the first key staff including the joint venture CEO and CFO. In closing, the third quarter of 2017 was a strong one and we remain focused on the following for the balance of the year. First continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery. Second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia. Third, advancing our new platforms imaging, advanced instruments, da Vinci SP and flexible robotics progress. And finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region. I will now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you Gary. I will describe our results on a non-GAAP pro forma basis which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accrual, excess tax benefits related to employee stock awards and charges associated with stock based compensation and purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma result to our GAAP results on our website. Third quarter 2017 revenue was $806 million, an increase of 18% compared with $683 million for the third quarter of 2016 and an increase of 7% compared with second quarter revenue of $756 million. Included in third quarter revenue was the recognition of $21 million of revenue deferred in conjunction with the da Vinci X tradeout program we offered certain first quarter customers. Excluding the $21 million, revenue would have increased 15% compared with 2016. We expect the remaining $2 million of deferred revenue under the first quarter tradeout program to be recognized by year-end. Third quarter 2017 procedures increased approximately 15% compared with the third quarter of 2016 and decreased approximately 2% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year was driven by general surgery in U.S. and urology worldwide. The decline in procedure relative to the second quarter primarily reflects seasonality. Patrick will provide more detail concerning procedure adoption. Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of $401 million increased 15% compared with last year and increased 1% compared with the second quarter of 2017 which closely reflects procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,880 per procedure compared with $1,870 last year and $1,830 last quarter. The increases reflect increased sales of our stapling and vessel sealing products and variations in customer buying patterns. Excluding the recognition of deferred revenue, systems revenue of $237 million increased 15% compared with the third quarter of 2016 and increased 9% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher system placements, partially offset by a higher number of operating lease placements and lower average selling prices. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects higher average selling prices and fewer lease placements. 169 systems replaced in the third quarter of 2017 compared with 134 systems in the third quarter of 2016 and 166 systems last quarter. 20 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 15 systems in the third quarter of 2016 and 27 last quarter. As of the ended the third quarter of 2017, there were 134 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $7 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $4 million in the third quarter of 2016 and approximately $6 million last quarter. We generated approximately $11 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $13 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $5 million last quarter. Globally, our average selling price which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts and revenue deferral was $1.47 million compared with $1.53 million last year and $1.46 million last quarter. The decrease in ASP compared to the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflects a higher proportion of trade-in transactions, lower priced systems sold to cost sensitive market segments and lower pricing offered to customers purchasing multiple systems. We believe the flexible financing programs like operating leases have positively impacted our ability to grow our installed base. While the number of leases is difficult to predict in the short-term, we expect a proportion of these types of the arrangements will increase over time. Service revenue of $147 million increased 13% year-over-year and increased approximately 3% compared with the second quarter of 2017. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Third quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $213 million increased 13% compared with $189 million for the third quarter of 2016 and increased 4% compared with $205 million for the second quarter. Approximately $5 million of deferred revenue recognized in the quarter was outside the U.S. Excluding the deferred revenue recognition, the increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased system placements net of leases and increased instrument and accessory revenue. Outside of the U.S., we placed 62 systems in the third quarter compared with 49 in the third quarter of 2016 and 63 systems last quarter. Four of the system placements in the current quarter were operating leases compared with one last year and five last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 25 into Europe, 14 into Japan, five into India, four into New Mexico and one into China. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation pattern and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2017 was 71.8% compared with 73.1% for the third quarter of 2016 and 71.3% for the second quarter of 2017. The da Vinci X tradeout program had little impact on our margins. The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflects a $7 million medical device tax refund received in 2016 and decreased service margins associated with higher scope repair cost. The increase compared with the second quarter primarily reflects leverage achieved with higher production level. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our new products, mix of systems in instrument and accessory revenue, our ability to further reduce product cost and improve manufacturing efficiency and the reinstatement of the medical device tax in 2018. Pro forma operating expenses increased 21% compared with the third quarter of 2016 and increased 2% compared with last quarter. The increases reflect our planned investments in product development, specifically da Vinci SP, flexible robotics, imaging and advanced instrumentation and expansion of our OUS markets. Our operating expenses for 2017 may grow slightly greater than previous guidance reflecting higher revenue growth. As we have indicated, we are committed to reducing the growth rate of operating expenses in 2018 compared with 2007. However as 2017 revenue growth and in turn operating leverage have exceeded our expectations, it is likely we will not create operating leverage in 2018 over 2017 actual results. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 9.5% compared with an effective tax rate of 22.7% for the third quarter of 2016 and 29.2% last quarter. The third quarter of 2017 and 2016 included reductions of $68 million and $16 million of reserves related to the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain tax years. Without these reductions, our third quarter 2017 and 2016 pro forma tax rate would have been 28.6% and 27.7%. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income and with the impact of one-time items. Our third quarter 2017 pro forma net income was $324 million or $2.77 per share, compared with $246 million or $2.06 per share for the third quarter 2016 and $228 million or $1.98 per share for the second quarter of 2017. All per share amounts reflect the three-for-one stock split affected in October. Recognition of the $21 million of deferred revenue net of cost and income tax increased GAAP and pro forma net income per diluted share by approximately $0.09. The income tax reserve reversal of $68 million increased GAAP and pro forma net income per diluted share by approximately $0.59. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $298 million or $2.55 per share for the third quarter of 2017 compared with $211 million of $1.77 per share for the third quarter of 2016 and $222 million of $1.92 per share for the second quarter of 2017. GAAP net income included $10 million of net charges associated with legal settlements compared with no charges recorded in the third quarter of 2016 and $5 million of net benefit recorded last quarter. GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2017 also included a charge of $6 million associated with purchased IP. These costs are excluded from our pro forma result. Beginning in 2017, we are required under GAAP to report the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with employee stock awards in our tax provision rather than as an adjustment to paid in capital as in prior periods. The excess tax benefit included in our GAAP result for the third quarter was $20 million contributing $0.17 per share, compared with $31 million contributing $0.27 per share in the second quarter of 2017. We have excluded these benefits from our pro forma results. This amount will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the volume of employee stock option exercises, number of RSUs vesting and the value of our stock. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.8 billion, up from $3.4 billion as of June 30, 2017. The increase generally reflects cash generated from operations. The accelerated stock buyback agreement we entered into in the first quarter will c lose in the fourth quarter. Based on our current stock price, we will be required either to deliver shares or pay cash to close out the arrangement. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over procedure and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan: Thanks Marshall. Of our third quarter procedure growth of 15%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 12% and outside of the United States procedures grew approximately 23%. Procedure trends were consistent with the first half of the year with growth led by U.S. general surgery and global urology. During the quarter, in the United States strength in general and thoracic surgery continued, growth in mature procedure categories moderated, there was one fewer weekday and we estimate that hurricanes impacted U.S. procedure growth rates by less than 1%. In U.S. urology, the third quarter growth rate for da Vinci prostatectomy was similar to the first half of 2017. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. During the quarter, growth in kidney procedures moderated compared to the first half of the year. In U.S. gynecology, third quarter procedure growth was flat compared to the prior year. Compared to the first half of 2017, the moderation in third quarter procedure growth was due to benign procedures. Third quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong led by growth in hernia repair. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in the United States with solid contribution from colorectal and thoracic procedures. Turning abroad. Procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 23% in the third quarter led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, hysterectomies and colorectal resections. Procedure growth was strong in Asia and variable by country in Europe. The one fewer weekday compared to the third quarter of 2016 was partially offset by the timing of certain regional holidays. Outside of the United States, procedure growth was led by China, South Korea, Germany and Japan. Procedure growth rates in China moderated despite continued strong expansion in system utilization. System placements remained constrained pending the issuance of a new quota for civilian hospitals. We have no update regarding the status of the quota. In South Korea, growth was led by gynecology and urology, including contribution from single site use in gynecology. In Germany and Japan, procedure growth rates in the third quarter were similar to the first half of 2017 led by the adoption of urology procedures. During quarter, recently placed da Vinci X systems generated solid utilization. The systems were largely used in urology and gynecology procedures with general surgery procedures in the United States. Globally, evidence continues to build in the support of clinical and economic validation of da Vinci surgery. During the quarter, an economic analysis studying the impact of da Vinci hysterectomy in Denmark was published in the Journal of Robotic Surgery. The work was completed by a team of researchers from Aarhus University and Odense University. Comparing more than 7,600 hysterectomy patients across open, laparoscopic and da Vinci surgery, the authors compared the comprehensive cost of care from the year preceding to the year following a hysterectomy for benign or malignant conditions. For benign procedures, the authors found that da Vinci hysterectomy was less expensive than either open or laparoscopic procedures. For less complex malignant procedures, da Vinci hysterectomy was more expensive than laparoscopic procedures and less expensive than open surgery. Within this population, the authors determined that the da Vinci patient cohort was more complex than the laparoscopic cohort and largely replaced open surgery at most institutions. In conclusion, the authors stated "Our study demonstrates that the use of robotic technology for hysterectomy is potentially cost saving from a broad healthcare perspective." This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2017. Starting with procedures, on our last call we estimated full year 2017 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 753,000 procedures performed in 2016. We are now increasing our estimate for 2017. We now anticipate full year 2017 procedure growth within a range of 15% to 16%. In regards to system placements, although the proportion of Q3 systems placed under operating leases was slightly lower than Q2, we continue to expect that over time the proportion of systems we place under operating leases will generally trend upwards. With increasing placements in the cost sensitive market segments, we expect that our average system selling price will continue to trend gradually lower. As Marshall mentioned, $21 million of the $23 million deferred in Q1 related to our da Vinci X tradeout program was recognized in Q3. We expect to recognize the remaining $2 million in Q4 and closeout the program. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2017 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71.5% of net revenue. We now expect to come in at the top end of the range and anticipate pro forma gross profit margin to be between 71% and 71.5% of net revenue. Turning to operating expenses. As we have described previously, we have accelerated our investments in several strategic areas that will benefit the company over the long term. Accordingly we have ramped our operating expenses as we focus on execution. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2017 operating expenses to grow at the higher end of the range between 17% and 18% above 2016 levels. We now expect pro forma 2017 operating expenses to grow between 18% and 19%. We continue to forecast our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $200 million and $210 million in 2017 as communicated our last call. We expect 2017 other income to be at the top end of the $35 million to $40 million range forecast on our last call. With regard to income tax, we now expect our Q4 2017 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, compared to our previous guidance of 28% to 29.5%. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Thanks. Can you hear me okay, guys?
Calvin Darling: Yes.
Amit Hazan: Let me start with your new thoughts on 2018 actually and to hit that to make sure we had it clear. So I think in the past you were talking about higher OpEx spending this year and then normalizing in 2018. That's how we started the year. What are you thinking about OpEx spending for 2018? In the comments that you made and historically it would have been high single digits would have been normal? What do you consider to be the new target?
Calvin Darling: Yes. I think what we have said is that we would expect, as you said, return to normal spending next year, normal being defined as something that's more in line with revenue growth. I think that what we are seeing this year is, we are outperforming on the revenue line and we wind up with much higher leverage than we had expected and therefore higher profit margins. And so if we continue our spending, even if we decrease the rate of spending next year or the rate of increase next year, you still wind up with not achieving leverage as maybe we were indicating before. So it all has to do with where we are coming out this year relative to next year. In total, if you looked at plans on a two-year basis from last year to next year, it's really pretty consistent with that.
Amit Hazan: Okay. And then just on the installed base in the U.S., it's now three quarters in a row that you had really strong numbers, especially new additions to the installed base. I think it's almost doubled what we saw last year. So I think you guys will always point us to procedures as the key leading indicator. But I am wondering if there is any additional insight as to why it's been so strong so far this year and how much does that growth in the U.S. installed base improve your confidence for U.S. procedure growth over the next 12 months?
Calvin Darling: Yes. You took some of the words right out of our mouth. Procedure growth really does drive placement growth. So we kind of think of it in that order. And procedure growth, we have talked about what that's been. It's been strong over the last few quarters. And to-date, 85% of our system placements have been to existing hospitals with roughly two-thirds of that expanding the installed base. So what we are seeing is hospitals growing procedures, having a need for additional capacity and therefore buying systems. 90% of systems we have sold are fourth generation, as Gary indicated, so Xi and X. And what we see there is that people want to avail themselves of the latest capabilities including computer-aided setup, optimized advanced instruments and table motion and multi-quadrant access. So it's a number of factors that are driving it. It's hard to predict. We don't give you guidance on systems going forward. But that's what's driven it so far.
Amit Hazan: And I will squeeze in one quick one on physicians trained. I am just curious. So basically in general surgery specifically, if you have got a sense of roughly how much of your growth is being driven by new physicians being trained? And how much is just kind of an improvement in same-store sales, so to speak? And how much runway we might have left before kind of new surgeons trained in general surgery as a driver?
Patrick Clingan: Hi Amit. It's Patrick. We see a pretty balanced growth across both new surgeons who are starting da Vinci general surgery for the first time as well as those who continue to expand their practice by either doing more patients within the existing procedures that they have been performing as well as adding new procedures to the list that they have been performing over time.
Amit Hazan: All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Gary, I had one quick question on some pipeline dynamics. I may come back to the cost after that, but just two things. You reiterated the SP regulatory timing end of this year. Is it a good estimate for us for commercial launch for SP first quarter 2018? And the second part of that question was just on flexible catheter. You talked about the regulatory pathway, but you give us any sense of 510(k) PMA? We have been assuming 510(k). And whether there is any commercial timeline that you could share?
Gary Guthart: Sure. So on SP, we don't know exactly the launch date, just given what questions we might get back from FDA. So we have that as well as finalizing some of the supply chain work we want to do. But we are working hard and solving the problems that we think we need. So I don't have any additional update for you on the SP commercialization ramp. We will report you when 510(k) goes in and what we think about it. On the flex side, likewise what we described in the script. We are making good progress on developing the technologies and finalizing our regulatory approach. We believe it's a 510(k). We will find out. FDA has a say on all that. But our plans are such that it's 510(k). We have not set a launch date yet for public consumption.
David Lewis: Okay. And then just coming back to spending, either for Gary or Marshall. The thing about 2017 was, you wanted to invest at a greater level because you had a lot going on in the pipeline. By our math and your guidance for next year for flat margins is consistent with our model. But it basically implies about $1 billion in R&D and combined SG&A which is a nice big round number. Can you give us any sense of the spending involved? I think investors are totally comfortable with increased spending if they think that spending is going to generate a higher return. So the kind of things you are working on for next year and why that level of spending is necessary? Thanks so much.
Gary Guthart: Sure. It's a good question. As Marshall said, we haven't really changed our view of what kind of spending is required in 2018, just a little bit of a math of 2017 changes relative to what the total operating margin looks like. With regard to what we are investing in, we go from essentially a single platform in the field in multiport da Vinci to SP, which is a new patient side plus accessories and instrumentation as well as flex catheter which we think is really important. So on the R&D side, you have got broadening of platform lanes. And we think those are important because they don't get developed in a year. They take both technology development as well as technique development and all the commercialization steps that you all are well aware of. So that's kind of one side. The flip side is, a set of investments are on making sure that we can support the scale of the business in the multiport space and that has to do with making sure your factories are right and you have invested in plants and equipment and you get the advantages of scale as you grow. And we have started to see that at the gross margin line, the improvements and the performance above some of our earlier expectations are the result of some hard work in manufacturing efficiencies which I think, I would be supportive of riding it shoulder side. I think it makes a lot of sense. Those are really the investment priorities. There is a little bit in there about data generation in local markets to support the needs of our customers in the markets in which they operate, be it clinical data or economic data. So that picks up, that rounds out kind of the investment profile. Probably not a surprise to you at all.
David Lewis: All right. Thanks Gary.
Operator: And our next question comes from one of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. So the first question I wanted to ask is for Gary. I noticed obviously that TransEnterix has got an FDA approval and what struck me as interesting is they got approval for 23 different indications, 23 different types of surgeries, some without data. And I was just curious, does this suggest that FDA might be willing to approve multiple indications? And could this potentially advance some of your timelines for the different indications that you are looking at for SP and some of your technologies?
Gary Guthart: Yes. It's a fair question. So the first thing is, the use of kind of one set of data to get additional procedures, that's something that was discussed with FDA in their workshop a couple of years ago and has been employed by us and by others. So the idea that there are some procedures that are kind of the key data generators that create an umbrella for other procedures is not a surprise to us. It is something that we have worked with FDA on and we are not surprised that others re likewise using it. I think with regard to what evidentiary requirements are, which is a little bit underneath your question, the issue there is that how FDA views this is what you ask for in terms of labeling and claims and the relative evidence to support that are linked and whether this signals a change in FDA's posture you really have to read the specifics of the labeling as well as what the submitted data was. We will do that carefully when it comes out and we will assess whether their posture has changed or not. But on its surface, just reading what you have seen so far, what we have seen so far, A, we are not surprised that there are a set of procedures and kind of the devil is in the details is to how they viewed it.
Bob Hopkins: Okay. Fair enough. So we will follow-up after we get more details there. And then I apologize, Marshall, just one more on the 2018 comment. I assume from the comments and some of the math that what you are implying here is a double digit level of increase in OpEx in 2018. Is that a fair assumption?
Marshall Mohr: Well, we will provide you guidance when we get to next quarter. We are ready to commit to what the increase would be. It's just that as we sit here today, we would imagine that we would not be adding leverage to the model. Our spend in 2017 to-date has been right where we thought it would be. Revenue has come in pretty well. And our margins and other cost have been where we have expected them. And so it just changes the profitability relative to what we were thinking nine months ago.
Bob Hopkins: I mean that's really the basis for the question. I am trying to get at what percentage of this is really could be associated with just increased confidence in the outlook for revenue growth next year?
Marshall Mohr: So we will get to the guidance for you in the next quarter.
Bob Hopkins: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Hi. Thanks. First question on dVP. I want to make sure I heard this right. I think you said 3Q volumes in the U.S. similar to the first half of the year. If that's right, that seems to be in contrast to what you talked about in terms of moderating to low single digit growth just a month ago. So can you clarify that?
Patrick Clingan: Yes. Tycho, to clarify, the comment on dVP was that growth rates were very consistent to first half the year, but the category of urology moderated compared to the first half of the year, so inclusive of other procedures like kidney procedures.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then thinking a little bit ahead on SP, as we think about the initial urology rollout, this is really about improved clinical outcomes maybe versus market expansion, I guess. Can you maybe just talk to how you think about that factoring into the adoption cycle since this is kind of a new approach in terms of getting FDA approval by procedure? How does that play into the mix in terms of how of this is going to be an upsell to the installed base versus potential market expansion, if you will, when you do roll it out for urology?
Patrick Clingan: Yes. In the early parts of rollout, we expect to do that in a measured way and the beginnings will be around clinical publications and evidentiary building, building of evidence. We think it has multispecialty implications and so part of this will be to follow through and get multispecialty indications with FDA and you see some of the trials they are doing that. I don't know that SP harkens a different regulatory pathway for FDA. You had implied that in your question and I am not sure that I agree with that implication. So far it doesn't look like a foundationally different way to communicate with FDA. With regard to the question of how much of this is, we are kind of working backward into the existing procedure base we do in pursuit of better outcomes and how much would expanded opportunity. I think we are going to see some of both and it's a little bit early to size exactly which. I have been impressed by surgeons' interest in both categories, both improving what they do already as well as being able to approach technique and applications they have not yet done. So I think that's why we are excited about. It is the potential to do both. And I would just say, stay tuned there as we get more experience and put these in the field.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then just lastly, on thinking about clinical data readout, two weeks from now you have data coming out at CHEST. Any preview you can give us for those who don't want to go to Toronto.
Gary Guthart: No. I cannot.
Tycho Peterson: All right. Figured it was worth a shot. Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Thanks Tycho.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I will just start with the flex catheter and then I had one on the competition. So the data at CHEST, is that going to be enough for 510(k) clearance in the U.S.? Or you will have to do another trial for 510(k) clearance? And on the our last call, your estimate how your flex catheter system compares to Medtronic' superD. There is another robotic system being developed in the field that we hear is similar to yours. Is that a fair characterization? I would be curious if you had any comments on that. I had one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Okay. So on the sufficiency of data, thus far, to-date, vis-à-vis 510(k) clearance, don't know yet. So we will see. I can't give you a positive or negative indication. With regards to other folks working on flex approaches that are robotic, we have heard likewise, indications that people are interested in pursuing that. Very little publicly available out there and we won't speculate as to what their plans are ahead of whatever their public relations are. But we remain vigilant and I guess my major point on this one is, the way you satisfy your customers best is by understanding their needs and being really conversant in what they want and what the technologies are. And so I worry a lot less about what others are doing and a lot more about what we are doing. And our team is highly focused in satisfying customer need in that space and we feel good about where we are.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks Gary. And then just for my follow-up on the competition. I guess I will only ask one broad question on the TransEnterix approval. Any just comments, Gary, you know from a technology or an IP standpoint and potential for this elongating the selling cycle in the U.S.? Thanks for taking the questions.
Gary Guthart: With regard to other systems that are coming or have come out, our experience goes back pretty far. So we have lived through the pathway of hybrid surgical approaches, some robotics, some manual, three-arm systems, some things integrated, some things not integrated. We have lived through that and its our customers who have really taken us to the position we are in with integrated systems, things that work very well together. Simple examples, if you have a manual stapler and you are using robotic system, the surgeon has to often almost always scrub in and scrub out because it's unusual for physician's assistant to fire a stapler. So the workflow of getting up and sitting down is really challenging. The challenge of integrating multiple different technologies from multiple different vendors at the Or is a headache and they tell us that. We like this all to work together as if it was designed with a whole thought. We didn't chose those things out of the blue. And so with our own systems, with systems we competed against 20 years ago, we have kind of seen this. And so I think that customers will think that through and evaluate it. You would ask, could it delay sales cycles? And the answer to that is yes, it can in the near-term. Now we are facing some of these concepts and competitive system in Europe and customers are evaluating these things and making decisions. I think they make them based on a pretty good basis. And so it may cause some short-term ripples, but we will be ready to engage those conversations with hospitals. And again, I think we didn't end up where we are by accident. That's true in our IP portfolio as well and one of the things about being the market leader is you have to solve these problems first and you get to patent them and we have. So that's something that's an asset for the company as we go forward.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Isaac Ro: Good afternoon guys. Thank you. Just a quick question on China. You guys mentioned that procedure growth decelerated even though utilization per instrument or per system went up. Can you talk a little bit about whether or not we should be thinking about your existing installed base sort of hitting full capacity utilization until we get more of an update on the quota system?
Patrick Clingan: Yes. Isaac, I think we have been surprised by the levels of utilization that we see across many of the civilian hospitals within China and to-date this year they have surpassed levels we thought that we will start to see faster slowdown there. You are starting to see the law of large numbers catch up but still strong growth in utilization. So I think the short answer is, we are not sure exactly where the ceiling is because the demand for robotic surgery in China is large and they continue to find ways to efficiently maximize the time they have on robotics each week.
Isaac Ro: Okay. And then just to follow-up on the new areas of investment for 2018 as it relates to your comments on operating leverage. Can you comment maybe even just even just qualitatively on some of the biggest areas of new investment that are incremental to the underlying programs your already had planned? I am just trying to get a sense of where those resources are being deployed.
Gary Guthart: The way to think about it in terms of just staying on the R&D product pipeline side, the peak in platform investment is several quarters before launch those things peak. And then they stay at that peak for a couple of quarters as you process through all launch activities and then you start to come off that peak. And so you have two platform that are heavily in design and moving toward commercialization. And that's the bulk of the delta. With regard to some of the other spending, that tends to be in little bit smaller increments. And it's around things that give us manufacturing optimization. As procedure growth has continued to grow and we get additional scale, a lot of the costs in production and handling of our systems comes down to manufacturing process and scale changes we have an opportunity to tweak what we do to get lower costs. And I think that helps everybody. I think it helps Intuitive. It helps our customers. And it allows us to take advantage of scale. That's a really good thing. And so where we see those opportunities, they are pretty easy to evaluate and we move forward on them.
Isaac Ro: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter, Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two quick ones. Just you have mentioned in the past and you again, Gary, highlighted some of the imaging developments and advancements you have been working on. Can you give us a sense as to what the timing might be on the integration of some of those into your current platforms?
Gary Guthart: Sure. So you think of imaging as having three elements of it. There is the hardware part, the optics, the electronics, the physical stuff. We are consistently improving those things and launch them as either improvements or as upgrades periodically. And you can sort of think those as having life cycles of multiple quarters, six to eight quarters. There is software improvements, image processing, image integration, those kinds of things. We also launch those either as upgrades or in conjunction with other opportunities and those go out also on account of a yearly or every other year basis. And then there is molecules, targeting agents. The molecules are viewed by the world as drugs and those go on drug timelines which are long. So we are progressing but it doesn't look like stasis. It is continuously improving our Gen 4 imaging as we speak. The Gen 4 scopes of today are better than the scopes of two years ago. The Gen 4 software is better today than it was years ago. And we continue to progress on the molecular front.
Richard Newitter: Okay. And then on the molecular, there is no concrete timeline?
Gary Guthart: Well, no. Given some of the trial activity that it has to go on, we have not yet published what we think the long term timelines are, in part because we are in conversation with the agency about how they want to view these diagnostic markers in surgery and that creates a lot of uncertainty as to what the forecast models would be.
Richard Newitter: Got it. And then just one follow-up. You mentioned that the moderation in EU for your European procedures in the third quarter. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit?
Patrick Clingan: Yes. There was moderation in certain markets, not in all. We still had strong growth in some like Germany. It was in a handful of markets, some I would characterize as slowdowns in some of the benign procedures where reimbursements are tight and other markets where you have had high levels of penetration in urology, dVP and where the emerging procedures are still small and not able to influence growth rate.
Richard Newitter: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Tao Levy. Please go ahead.
Tao Levy: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe you can start with the impact from hurricanes and I guess the one less surgery day in the U.S. So theoretically, if you had all that back in the quarter, are we talking about another 2% potentially on that U.S. growth? And do you expect to capture some of that business, at least from the hurricane means as more of a delay that you can pick up in the in the fourth quarter?
Patrick Clingan: Yes. Tao, it's really hard to calculate these things because certainly there is some patients who need surgery right way who come back faster and others that can defer longer. What you can look at it is just what happens in those markets during those period of time and make your best estimate. Our best estimate in the U.S. is that the hurricanes caused somewhere less that 1% impact to the U.S. growth rate. The one fewer weekday had some effect as well as just because you have one less Monday through Friday. But it's really hard to be precise about exactly how much it impacted business. Overall the U.S. didn't feel dramatically different though compared to prior years, particularly in the areas of general surgery and thoracic surgery.
Tao Levy: Thank you. And then you mentioned you are going to have, if I heard you correctly, that about 13 sort of new countries starting to do da Vinci procedures here in the second half of the year. Are these countries being supported directly? Are you using distributors? Are there opportunities where these countries will start to buy multiple systems? Or are these kind of more one-offs?
Gary Guthart: Tao, it's Gary. Just a clarification from the script. They are not new countries to us and da Vinci. It is da Vinci X availability in those countries. So the ability for us to sell the X system there.
Tao Levy: Okay. Got you. Thanks for that. And then just one last one. As you look at the SP for next year, again in urology, do you have a sense of how many SP surgeries have been performed in this current clinical evaluation phase? And how long will it take before some of those surgeons really start using the SP in sort of a more consistent fashion once it gets approved?
Gary Guthart: We will put out first set of systems after clearance. We are selecting sites that we think have multispecialty potential. And that will be limited at our discretion in the beginning so that we get those sites up and running, help them to be highly efficient. So we won't have a huge number. I think the demand will oversubscribe the supply in those early launch quarters. I think that it's a highly capable system. I think once we have clearance, there will be a fair amount of use. But it's going to be sequential clearances that help us get there.
Tao Levy: Okay. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Thanks Tao.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?
Gary Guthart: Yes.
Matt Taylor: Great. So you have touched on this before, but I guess I just wanted to ask a little bit more directly. If you could give us a flavor for anything that you are seeing broadly in the market with regards to utilization or appetite for capital purchases? I remember a couple of calls ago, you said, hey, we have some uncertainty around reform. Maybe we are going to see the gun shy buyers. But that clearly has not been the case this year on capital. So just any updates you can provide on the market and what your customers are saying?
Gary Guthart: Yes. You are right. We haven't seen a broad impact of potential reform or changes in ACA. The feel of the market is pretty similar over the last few quarters. And as I said earlier, really what we think is driving the strength of system placement has to do with procedure growth rate.
Matt Taylor: And in the U.S., clearly that's all about general surgery with some of the slowdowns that you are talking about in the mature procedures. And I was wondering if you could provide some more color on areas in general that have sprouted more recently? You talked about hernia for a while and ventral and colorectal. Are there any new areas that you are seeing start to grow as surgeon adapt and begin to use the next technology in new ways?
Gary Guthart: We do see new opportunities and surgeons interested in advancing. But before I get there, I think that just from our company's focus, we have not taken the ball off general surgery. I think that the ones we are in are still relatively early in their total adoption when you think about hernia repair and colon surgery and rectal surgery and thoracic surgery. These are major categories. We think that we can bring real value and our teams are really focused there. And I focus you there. I don't think we are past that and thinking there is the next thing. We do see surgeons asking for additional opportunities. They are not yet material. And so I think we have a long pipeline. I am not ready to describe them as opportunities for you yet, because I don't know that they will realize. But there is real desire. So we stay focused on finishing the opportunities that we have started and we are still on it.
Matt Taylor: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And the last question we have in queue comes from the line of Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brandon Henry: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the trends you are seeing in the U.S. gynecology market? And then I think you mentioned there was a moderation in benign procedures. Can you just talk about what led to that? I have a couple of follow-ups.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Brandon, overall in U.S. GYN, we saw pretty flat growth year-to-year. The deceleration compared to the first half of the year was entirely attributed to benign procedures that declined moderately. Malignant procedures continued to grow in the quarter. The trend there is in part because A, it's a very low growth area in general. You see high penetration rates of minimally invasive surgery. In any given period, you are going to have little movements here and there. So nothing notable to call out specifically as it relates to a trend there in the market.
Patrick Clingan: Yes. I think we have talked in the past about consolidation trends, right. More cases being done by gynecologic oncologists or other surgical specialists. And that's been a positive trend for us and that's largely continued here in the third quarter.
Gary Guthart: Right. And then we will just give you one more follow-up.
Brandon Henry: Sure. And in terms of new instrumentation, I think you mentioned a refined vessel sealer launch in Europe. Can you talk a little bit about the refinements made there and when you expect to launch in the U.S.? And then also do you have any update on timeline for new stapling technology? I think you mentioned a 60 millimeters stapler in the past. Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Yes. The vessel sealer is really a refinement in geometry. It allows surgeons to get to spaces that were more difficult prior. It's kind of a family member of the technology we have today. I don't have the launch date for U.S. in front of me. But we continue to build out our stapling line. As we have talked about in the past, likewise we have not projected yet the launch timeline of additional staplers. But we think stapling is important. So that's kind of where we are there. Let me go ahead and close. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organization remains focused on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months
Operator: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 6, 2017 and 10-Q filed on April 19, 2017. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC’s EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today’s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights; Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results; Patrick will discuss procedure and clinical highlights; then I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2017; and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I’ll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. As you know, Intuitive is focused on significantly improving surgery and enabling access to our products and services in pursuit of this mission globally. The momentum built over the past several quarters continued into the second quarter of 2017 with solid performance in procedures and strong growth in system placements. Growth in procedures for the quarter was 16% over the second quarter of 2016. Overall trends in the first quarter remained stable into the second. Starting with United States, both the emerging category of general surgery and more mature categories in urology and gynecology performed well. Hernia repair continues to stand out in the general surgery category with additional contributions coming from colon procedures. As we mentioned last quarter, European performance in Q1 of 2017 benefited from calendar tailwinds that we expected to balance out in the second quarter. Indeed, this occurred with core growth staying roughly steady through the first half of 2017 and European second quarter growth moderating. Procedure performance in Asia was solid, with growth in China being a highlight from a constrained installed base. Patrick will take you through these factors in more detail later in the call. Our capital placement performance in Q2 of 2017 strengthened with the growth in total placements from 130 in Q2 of 2016 to 166 this quarter. As we mentioned on these calls, capital placements can be lumpy as evidenced by our performance in the first half of the year. In the United States, placements rebounded from a softer Q1 to a strong Q2, anchored in repeat purchases by existing customers and multi system placements. System placements in Europe grew moderately, aided in part by the launch of da Vinci X. In Asia, the placements grew slightly over the prior year period and over last quarter, constrained for the time being by the lack of a new system quota in China and limited reimbursements in Japan. Marshall and Patrick will take you through system placement dynamics in greater detail. Turning to profitability for the quarter, strong system placements led to gross margins that are lower than last quarter. These margins are at the top of our expected range because of the strength in procedures and improvements in our operating efficiencies. Our fixed cost growth met our expectations with increases in R&D expenses, growth in staff in European and Asian markets, investment in clinical trials and growth in our corporate computational capabilities. Our second quarter pro forma operating results were as follows, procedures grew approximately 16% over the second quarter of last year. We shipped 166 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 130 in the second quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter was $756 million, up 13% from the prior year, instrument and accessory revenue increased to $398 million, up 17%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $540 million, representing 71% of total revenue. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.3%, compared to 71.9% in the second quarter last year, we generated a pro forma operating profit of $313 million in the quarter, up 5% from the second quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $228 million, up 4% from Q2 of 2016. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly. Turning to our product pipeline. As you know, in the back half of 2016 and the first half of 2017, we increased our mid term and long-term investments in creating our next generation of products and services. We anchored on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable a more minimally invasive surgery, better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. Starting with our multi-port portfolio. We developed a system pathway that responds to our customer’s desire for choice in clinical capability and choice in total economics. In the quarter, we've received our CE Mark and 510(k) clearance for da Vinci X, a system that brings core Xi technology into a highly capable, lower entry price surgical system. We're pleased with the early reception of X by our customers and the choice it brings to those around the world who seek to build robotic surgery programs with logical upgrade pathways and affordable access to our leading robot assisted surgery ecosystem. Our SP program continues progress in its human clinical trial work and pilot production capability. We now have four clinical trial sites active, three in the United States and one in Asia. Cases in Asia have included transoral, urologic and colorectal surgery, while those in the US are focused on transoral robotic-assisted surgery. As we mentioned in our last - in our call last quarter, we anticipate filing our 510(k) for SP in urology in the back half of 2017. Surgeon feedback from our trial sites is very encouraging. Our teams continue to work on product validations and manufacturing capability to support submission and launch. Lastly, our flexible robotics program is meeting our expectations and making good progress in its product design phases and definition of regulatory pathways. In closing, the second quarter of 2017 has carried forward momentum built in prior quarters and we remain focused on the following for the balance of the year. First, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery. Second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia; third, advancing our new platforms, imaging, advanced instruments, da Vinci SP and flexible robotics progress. And finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by region. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. I will describe our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards and charges associated with stock based compensation and purchase IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I would also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion. Second quarter 2017 revenue was $756 million, an increase of 13% compared with $670 million for the second quarter of 2016 and an increase of 12% compared with the first quarter revenue of $674 million. We launched the da Vinci X system during the second quarter in the US and European countries covered by CE Mark. In conjunction with the launch, we offered certain customers who purchased systems in the first quarter, the opportunity to upgrade or trade out their systems for the X system. As a result, we deferred 2$3 million of first quarter revenue, which we recognize when customers either trade out their systems or when the offers expire, whichever comes first. None of the deferred revenue was recognized in the second quarter. We expect substantially all of the deferred revenue to be recognized by year end. Second quarter 2017 procedures increased approximately 16% compared with the second quarter of 2016. It increased 5% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year and the first quarter has been driven by general surgery in the US and urology worldwide. Patrick will provide more detail concerning procedure adoptions. Revenue highlights are as follows, instrument and accessory revenue of $398 million increased 17% compared with last year and increased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2017, which closely reflects procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately $1,830 per procedure compared with $1,810 last year and $1,840 last quarter. The increase relative to the second quarter of 2016 primarily reflects increased sales of our stapling and vessel sealing products, partially offset by customer buying patterns. The decrease compared with the previous quarter primarily reflects customer buying patterns. System revenue of $216 million increased 7% compared with the second quarter of 2016 and increased 41% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects higher system placements and operating lease revenue, partially offset by lower average selling prices and lower lease buyout revenue. System revenue for the first quarter of 2017 excluded the $23 million of deferred revenue. Had the first quarter included net revenue, quarter-over-quarter increase would have been 23%, reflecting a higher number of system placements, partially offset by lower lease buyout revenue. 166 systems were placed in the second quarter of 2017, compared with 130 systems in the second quarter of 2016 and 133 systems last quarter. 27 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter, compared with 15 systems in the second quarter of 2016 and 21 last quarter. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. Of the 166 second quarter systems, 11 were X systems. As of the end of the second quarter of 2017, there were 120 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $6 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter, compared with 4 million in the second quarter of 2016 and approximately $5 million last quarter. We generated approximately $5 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $13 million in the second quarter of 2016 and $10 million last quarter. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts and revenue deferrals, was $1.46 million compared with $1.56 million last year and $1.46 million last quarter. The decrease in ASP compared to the second quarter of 2016 primarily reflects lower priced system sold to cost sensitive market segments and lower pricing offered to customers purchasing multiple systems. We believe the flexible financing programs, like operating leases have positively impacted our ability to grow our installed base. We expect a proportion of these types of arrangements would increase over time. Service revenue of $142 million increased 11% year-over-year. It increased approximately 1% compared with the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base with da Vinci systems. Outside of the US, results were as follows. Second quarter revenue outside of the US up $205 million increased 11% compared with $185 million for the second quarter of 2016. It increased 12% compared with $183 million for the first quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased system placements net of leases and increased instruments and accessories, reflecting procedure growth, partially offset by lower system ASPs. Patrick will provide procedure growth information. The year-over-year decline in system ASPs reflects increased sales of lower cost systems to cost-sensitive markets. The increase in revenue relative to the last quarter reflects increased system placements and increased instrument and accessory growth. Outside of the US, we placed 63 systems in the second quarter, compared with 51 in the second quarter of 2016 and 56 last quarter. 5 of the system placements in the current quarter were operating leases compared with two last quarter - last year and 6 last quarter. Current quarter system placements, including 29 into Europe, 14 into Japan, 5 into India, 5 into Australia and 3 into China. System placements outside of the US will continue to be lumpy as some of the O-US markets are in early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2017 was 71% compared with 72% for the second quarter of 2016 and 72% for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2016 primarily reflects decreased service margin associated with higher scope repair costs. The decrease compared with the first quarter reflects a higher proportion of system revenue relative to total revenue. Since we deferred costs associated with the $23 million revenue deferral, the trade out program had little impact on our margin. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency and in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. Pro forma operating expenses increased 23% compared with the second quarter of 2016. It increased 2% compared with last quarter. The increases are consistent with our planned investments in product development, specifically da Vinci Sp, flexible robotics, imaging and advanced instrumentation and the expansion of our O-US markets. The year-over-year growth rates will subside over the remainder of the year with total year growth still expected to be around 18%. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 29.2%, compared with an effective tax rate of 27.8% for the second quarter of 2016 and 28.1% last quarter. The increase in our tax rate reflects an increased proportion of US income relative to total income. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of US and O-US income and with the impact of one-time item. Our second quarter 2017 pro forma net income was $228 million or $5.95 per share, compared with $220 million or $5.62 per share for the second quarter of 2016 and $196 million or $5.09 per share for the first quarter of 2017. The $23 million revenue deferral, including the associated deferral of cost of sales and the income tax effects, reduced GAAP and pro forma net income per share in the first quarter of 2017 by approximately $0.28 per share. Earnings per share benefited from the full impact of our $2 billion stock buyback as we retired approximately 2.4 million shares on January 27, 2017. At this point, given the increase in the share price since the start of the ASR, the ultimate number of shares delivered under the ASR may not change materially from the initial delivery. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $222 million or $5.77 per share for the second quarter of 2017, compared with $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016 and $180 million or $4.67 per share for the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net income for the second quarter included a net benefit of $5 million associated with litigation settlements, net of charges, compared with $4 million of charges in the second quarter of 2016 and $21 million of charges last quarter. GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2017 also included a charge of approximately $6 million associated with purchased IP. Beginning in 2017, we are required under GAAP to report the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with employee stock awards in our tax provision, rather than as an adjustment to be paid in capital as in prior periods. The excess tax benefit included in our GAAP results for the second quarter was $31 million, contributing $0.80 per share compared with $33 million, contributing $0.85 per share in the first quarter of 2017. We have excluded these benefits from our pro forma results. This amount will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the volume of employee stock option exercises and the number of RSUs vesting and the value of our stock. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.4 billion, up from $3.1 billion as of March 31st, 2017. The increase reflects cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who'll go over our procedure and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan: Thanks, Marshall. Of our second quarter procedure growth of 16%, US procedures grew approximately 14%, and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 22%. Procedure trends were consistent with the first quarter with growth led by US general surgery and global urology. In the United States, both mature and growth procedures, such as general and thoracic surgery, outperformed our plan. The majority of the out performance was driven by continued growth in our mature procedures. In US urology, the second quarter growth rate for da Vinci Prostatectomy was modestly higher than the first quarter. We believe that our US prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. In US gynecology, second quarter procedure growth sustained trends observed during the first quarter. Procedure growth in US GYN appears to be driven by consolidation of surgeries towards physicians that specialize in complex and cancer surgery who tend to be users of the da Vinci system. First quarter US general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remains strong, led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in the United States, and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains strong sound. Growth trends in lobectomy and other thoracic procedures continued to show strength off of a small base. Second quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. One that we like to highlight is from Dr. Rashidi from the University of Texas and colleagues from Providence Health and Services who published a study of more than 3500 colorectal patients treated by 58 high volume surgeons within the Providence Health and Services network in the American Journal of Surgery. The authors found that in exchange for a longer operating time, patients treated on the da Vinci system experienced a threefold reduction in conversion rate and nearly a day shorter length of hospital stay compared to laparoscopy. In addition, the authors found that there was no difference in total direct cost between the two cohorts. Turning abroad, procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 22% in the second quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures, general surgery and gynecology. As we discussed last quarter, the timing of the Easter holidays from Q1 into Q2, which provided a tailwind to our first quarter results, served as a headwind in the quarter, likely reducing our outside of the United States procedure growth by an estimated 3%. Taken together, first half procedure growth of 25% provides a better representation of procedure performance outside of the United States and either quarters result. Procedure growth was led by China, Germany and Japan. Procedure growth in China was driven by strong expansion and system utilization, as system placements remained the same, pending issuance of new quota for civilian hospitals. Procedure growth in China is broad based with a number of specialties contributing to the strong performance. In Germany, procedure growth is supported by installed base expansion that is driving strong adoption in urology with contributions from general surgery. In Japan, dVP and DVPN continued to grow, though year-to-year comparisons have begun to slow as dVP adoption has crossed 80%. During the quarter, the first clinical experience on da Vinci X occurred in Germany. Initial procedures included urology and gynecology with strong utilization. Commenting on the experience, Dr. Vitt, from San Antonio's Hospital Genoa [ph] stated, da Vinci X is 'ideal' add on to our existing da Vinci Xi same feeling on the console.' Globally, evidence continues to build in support of the clinical and economic validation of da Vinci surgery. During the quarter, an economic analysis studying the impact of da Vinci partial nephrectomy in England was published in European urology. The work was completed by HCD Economics, an affiliate of the University of Chester. Comparing more than 4200 partial nephrectomy patients between open and da Vinci surgery, the authors found that da Vinci surgery lowered the total cost to treat during the first year after the procedure by an average of £900, primarily by reducing postoperative and patient utilization from length of stay, cancer and other readmissions and 90 day complications. This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin. 
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2017. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2017 procedure growth of 12% to 14% above the approximately 752,000 procedures performed in 2016. Now, based largely upon continued strong results in US growth and mature procedure categories in China, we are increasing our estimate for 2017. We now anticipate full year 2017 procedure growth within a range of 14% to 15%. During the second half of the year, we expect our procedure growth rate to moderate, in part, due to one fewer operating day during the third quarter. As we move into the second half of the year, we also expect contributions from China and Japan to temper until we obtain a new quota and place additional systems in China and obtain additional procedural reimbursements in Japan. With regards to system placements, a record high of 27 of the 166 second quarter system placements were structured as operating leases. In the second half of 2017, we expect the proportion of systems placed under operating leases will continue to increase. The average selling price per system sold outright will vary quarter-to-quarter based upon factors, including product, regional and trading mix. With increasing placements into cost-sensitive markets, we expect that our average system selling price will continue to trend gradually lower in the back half of 2017. As Marshall mentioned, no amounts were either deferred or released in Q2 related to our da Vinci X trade-in program. Going forward, we expect to defer no further revenue related to this program and expect to release and recognize substantially all of the $23 million accrued during the first quarter by the end of this year. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2017 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. We are now modestly raising the top end of the range and expect pro forma gross profit margin to be between 70% and 71.5% of net revenue. Turning to operating expenses. As we have described previously, we have accelerated our investments in several strategic areas that will benefit the company over the long-term. Accordingly, we have ramped our operating expenses as we focus on execution. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2017 operating expenses to grow at the higher end of a range between 15% and 18% above 2016 levels. We continue to expect results at the high end of the range between 17% and 18% for the year. On our last call, we forecast our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $190 million and $200 million in 2017. Now based upon updated Black Scholes evaluation estimates, we expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $200 million and $210 million. We expect 2017 other income to be between $35 million and $40 million, compared to the $30 million to $35 million range forecast on our last call. With regard to income tax, we now expect our 2017 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 29.5% of pre-tax income, higher than our previous guidance of 26.5% to 28.5% based upon a higher anticipated mix of US pre-tax profits. During Q2, we had 38.4 million diluted shares outstanding for EPS calculations, roughly equal to the first quarter as the share reduction related to the full quarter impact of the Q1 accelerated share buyback was mostly offset by the dilutive effects of our higher stock price. As a result of our higher stock price, we don't expect the ultimate number of shares received and retired when the ASR closes later this year to vary significantly versus the 2.4 million shares already retired in January. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Go ahead please.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. First on X, I know its early days, obviously, but any color you can provide on the funnel in terms of diversity of existing customers and maybe the types of customers that are emerging?
Gary Guthart: I don't think we'd call out anything surprising here. We had indicated to you in prior quarters that we think cost sensitive customers, particularly in Europe are going to be interested and that remains so. It may have broader rebate than that over time.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then urology continue to do well here. That hasn't reverted to lower growth rates, you know, I think you’d previously expected, can you talk about that sequential pick up? Can you maybe just talk to the sustainability of those trends in the US urology dVP market?
Marshall Mohr: Hey, Tycho, I think we continue to believe that our prostatectomy volumes are following broader prostate surgery trends. As you know, prostate surgery really only represents about third of all men diagnosed in the US with prostate cancer. So time to time you’ll see movements between watchful waiting, radiation and surgery. We think – mostly you've seen the procedures recover from the prior USPSTF decision in 2012, where we worked through patients who had the disease progress. We think at this stage you're just seeing general small movements between populations period-to-period.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. I’ll leave at that. Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Tycho.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Go ahead please.
Bob Hopkins: Hi. Thanks, good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?
Gary Guthart: Hi, Bob. Yes.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Good afternoon. So, the first thing I wanted to touch on, just kind of looking through the results, which were obviously strong and pretty much across the board. But the US capital number really stuck out as a strong number. And you mentioned more kind of multi-system sales and repeat customers. Is this really a function of the increase in procedure volume growth and higher utilization or was there something else going on this quarter?
Gary Guthart: I think it's the former. We're seeing – first of all, I think the consolidation of US customers into IDNs means that the negotiations are often happening when they are up. And I think they're looking across their portfolio of MIS opportunities and making decisions in broader settings. I think it's a continuation of a trend we've been seeing over the past several quarters.
Bob Hopkins: Great. And the other thing I just want to follow up is a couple of quick checks on the pipeline timelines. You mentioned China and Japan as constraining you in the back half. Is there any update at all on the China quota from a timing perspective or even your sense as to whether or not it could happen this year? And also wanted to just get a quick update for timelines for SP beyond urology and the filings we could expect, either later this year or into 2018? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Sure. I’ll – Marshall, I'll let you take the China quota, and I'll take the SP. 
Marshall Mohr: Okay. China quota, there is no new news here. It is as we’ve stated before, the quota system involves, first the government – is tied up in the overall government – the government's overall planning process. They did approve their budget in December. We – after that, it then rolls through a series of decisions about province spending, as well as hospital spending and then eventually we'll hear something about a quota. We don't know when that will be and what we would caution is that you put anything in the models for this year, frankly, because last time, when the quota was approved, it took some time before the tender offers that the hospitals have to go through to get them done.
Gary Guthart: On the SP regulatory question, we are targeting 510(k) for urology in the back half of the year. There's a data collection going on at the IDE sites for transoral robotic surgery and some lab based clinical development for other procedures, as well as the trial site in Asia. We haven't yet publicly projected our timelines for submissions after the urology 510(k). There will be a set that come. It will be months, not years after the 510(k) submission. What that looks like will depend on the speed of closure of the clinical trial data and some of the conversations with FDA about what kind of submissions they'd like and we're not ready yet to anchor down those dates.
Bob Hopkins: Great. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Just maybe a few quick questions here. Gary, just for you. Just the SP timing, I know it came up in the pipeline. But on FC and I know it's pretty early. Can you give us any sense of the major markets, US, China, Europe, which one? Our sense is US and China are kind of ahead of Europe, but that's not based on a whole bunch. Which region you think proceeds the other and is 2019 a reasonable estimate for a launch in some geographic locale?
Gary Guthart: So, first to the question of which regions matter, we think it will have a global appeal, but I think you're right that United States and China and then Europe will be interesting. In terms of timing, a lot of it will be predicated on regulatory pathways and what kind of data requirements there are. We think there are real opportunities in China. We're going to make sure that we do that right with our joint venture partner. We likewise, think there is in the US and not ready yet to call when the launch dates are for both sets, because of negotiations with clinical trial results. Europe likewise, I think there's a little bit of uncertainty right now as to what kind of submission package will be required and that's one of the things we're in the midst of working out both internally and we have conversations with regulatory authorities over time. We will do a controlled launch when we're ready. So we've told you don't model any revenue into ‘18. We have not yet published and are not ready to publish when the final launch will be. We'll let you know as we get closer to some of the certainty on regulatory timelines.
David Lewis: Okay. Very helpful. And Marshall, just two quick kind of margin related questions for you. The first is, on gross margin. Given a greater systems mix, I guess, I was surprised to see gross margins as strong as they were. And I wonder, who would've thought that X, which wasn't very material in the quarter, would have also pressured margins. So what's driving the margin strength? And as it relates to X, is that just because a lot of the components of X frankly are ready at scale in other places of the business? And the second question related is, looking at hiring, we typically don’t ask about hiring, but I think your hiring level this quarter is 25% above the next highest level. That's pretty remarkable. I wonder if you would just share with us where you're hiring and where those people are being deployed? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Sure. On the X margins, X margins, we had communicated before, typically, when we introduce a new product you see a little bit of a decrease in the margin and then we work to improve it over time. You should – we did not expect as much of a decrease in margins due to X. X, as we said really is a result of putting together the parts that are already manufactured for other system. And so, we have worked out most of the cost effectiveness with that. As far as total margins, yeah, the total margin came down a little bit due to the mix of systems. I think it exceeded our expectations just because of the overall strength of procedures and the drive of - and it's driving instrument and accessory revenue above our original expectations.
Marshall Mohr: As far as headcount goes, David, we ended the quarter with 4,108 employees. That was up a little over 100 from the last quarter end, and it was 19% year-over-year and it really does vary up with the strategic investments that we're making in the business on that side. The majority of the investments were in our product operations group in the quarter.
David Lewis: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Go ahead please.
Tao Levy: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. May I could, I wanted to ask on the SP platform. So the pathway for I believe, filing later on, you know, towards the end of this year, and then assuming approval sometime next year. How is the launch going to proceed? Is this a – well, is an experienced da Vinci surgeon going to be able to sit in front of the SP, you know, in front of a console and use the SP right off the bat or are they going to have to go through proctoring of different types of cases? Just any color there would be great.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Just in broad brushes, it's a family member in the da Vinci family and a lot of – we believe a lot of the learning and skills will be portable from one of the family members to the other part. They're not identical. So, there'll be some learning that goes through that transition. We think experienced da Vinci surgeons will find that transition to be pretty manageable. What that looks like and how it's finally framed will evolve as we finish our clinical trials and our validations. But I'd expect a lot of that to be portable. I think in terms of rollouts, we'll be at a controlled rollout when we come out. And part of that controlled rollout will be for data generation at the first sites, and also we'll have some constraints due to what our labelling will be at the first launch given the regulatory sequence and pathway. Feedback from the clinical trial sites has been really good about usability of the system and meeting the expectations they had for what they believe they could do with that clinically. So far, so good there, and we also get pretty good insight into the characteristics of the system vis-à -vis what they're used to on Si and Xi and kind of the response to your initial question.
Tao Levy: Got you. Perfect. And then just lastly, anything special going on in Japan? They've got way more systems than they have – than they need it at this point and they keep on buying more. I don't know if there's – is there a government incentive or any credit there that they are using? Thanks.
Marshall Mohr: Hey, Tycho – sorry, Tao.
Tao Levy: That’s close. Don’t worry.
Marshall Mohr: Japan has a very diffused healthcare system and hospital network systems, so they're not very concentrated in terms of where the patients are. So – and while we are at a high level of penetration in dVP, we still have a lot of pockets of patients who are treated in fairly remote areas in local hospitals. So they continue to buy systems, even be able to access some of the mainly urology patients that are out there.
Gary Guthart: We’ve also been in Japan for some number of years here and I think there's a little bit of building capacity in hopes of broader reimbursements over time.
Tao Levy: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll go next to Amit Hazan with Citi. Go ahead, please.
Amit Hazan: Thanks. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just one on the quarter and then a couple longer term ones. So on the quarter, obviously going – just going back to the US system number, a really strong number. I wanted to ask about trade-ins though. They were weak again in the US, it's a second quarter in a row. I'm just trying to kind of better understand why, on one hand you’ve got this obvious growing pool of systems that need to be replaced, so you shouldn’t be really replacing more systems every year. On the other hand, there seems to be a relationship between quarters where you had really strong de novo units like this, this year so far, both quarters. And then trade-ins, kind of tend to be inversely recur [ph] in those quarters. What's kind of the correct way to be thinking about modeling trade-ins in the US?
Gary Guthart: Let me speak to our intent a little bit, and I'll ask Calvin to jump in on the modeling side. For us, our thought process really has been to enable accounts with technologies and support that help them get to their clinical goals and in support their MIS and MIS program goals. And if they can do that effectively with Si, we're happy to support them in that regard. If they want to add capacity or grow the system capability in some way that is benefited by our advanced technologies that helps us and drives a new system placement or new system sales. So our incentives aren't strongly built on trade-outs. Much more interested in aligning with how they want to build their programs and giving them access to technologies that make a difference in their procedures. That leaves the lumpiness and trade-outs and that's okay with us. Calvin, to the modeling, I just give a little time to think about it, go ahead. 
Calvin Darling: What I say, I mean, is that you have such strong procedure growth and such demand for access to systems among the surgeon population that in a lot of cases when hospitals are seeking to acquire new systems, they look at the procedures and the surgeons that they want to be able to do within their robotics program. And Si can still serve a broad range of patients and can help them facilitate that. So they tend to be buying more incremental systems than trading in.
Amit Hazan: Okay.
Gary Guthart: As X matures in the market, X maybe an opportunity for some folks who are happy with their capacity, but want to upgrade up to additional capabilities and that may provide an opportunity for us in future quarters.
Calvin Darling: And just quickly from the modeling perspective that you asked. Beware of using our past experience with our Xi and previous system launches as the model for what's going to happen now, because it's a different world where you have, again, consolidated hospital networks that can align certain procedure characteristics with sets of procedures with a lot more ability to do so now than in the past. So it could very well follow a different pattern this go around than it has in the past. 
Amit Hazan: Okay. So that could maybe possibly lead me into the next question, which is on reimbursement. It looks like prostate is getting a new Medicare outpatient reimbursement codes for the first time I believe, and I realize most of the dVP procedures can't really be done in one day just yet. But it just got me thinking about the question of what the trigger might be for hospitals to start equipping their outpatient settings with da Vinci? I have to imagine that between hysterectomies moving that way and things like hernia now, there's already enough volume to justify it nowadays. So is something like prostate reimbursement any kind of an incur that can maybe drive boxes into outpatient setting and if not, then what could be the trigger to do that?
Calvin Darling: Two important thoughts here. One is in order to be able to do a surgery like a dVP in an outpatient setting, first off, that has to be done in a minimally invasive fashion, so that you can have the patient be able to recover quick enough to get out of that setting. The second thing is you – outpatient is really a billing setting, not necessarily a side of care differentiator. What we see over time is that as programs mature in the robotics capacity, they have array of systems that can both serve really complex inpatient surgeries, like thoracic or colorectal. And they have sufficient volume of outpatient procedures like the ones you mentioned in hernia and gynecology and you could potentially dVP where you have a technique and a surgeon capable of getting a result that can get the patient out in the same day. You'll see them actually put systems in a multiple different types of settings. Typically, still under the hospitals umbrella because they're the ones who have the capability of treating the range of patients who come in with different complexities, they might be either inpatient or outpatient. But it's usually by product maturity of the program as opposed to a specific reimbursement event.
Amit Hazan: Okay. Thanks very much guys.
Calvin Darling: Thanks, Amit.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Isaac Ro: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Question for you on the X, just trying to think through the gross margin implications of that product cycle as it plays out. Realize it's a little early, but just trying to think through some of the comments you made earlier around how purchasing is evolving for hospitals and so forth. Is that product cycle plays out, could you give us some sense of what it means for your gross margin profile based on what you know now, that would be helpful?
Gary Guthart: Initially, the gross margin profile is not substantially different than our other products. So it kind of fits in nicely. I think what you are asking is, over time, could we see that there is pressure on the ultimate price that we charge for X? I think we'll see. We don't know. It's only been out in the market for a quarter and - but what we've said in the past is that we're about the market expansion and if there's the opportunities to expand the market at the expense of a little bit of price, we do that.
Isaac Ro: That's helpful. And then just as a follow up on the expense side. As you move towards expanding the market, interested in sort of allocation of resources and the sales force, can you talk a little bit about just qualitatively how you're moving some of your top performers to help drive X conversion, and then at the same time maybe thinking about adding new heads, just interested in the interplay on investment in sales force? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. How we think about sales force investments really varies by region and maturity of the market. So how we're building the sales team in Germany for example, will look kind of qualitatively different than what's happening in the United States. In general, the United States, we've had a stable structure growth in our key accounts teams, no surprise, and a little bit better stratification of levels in the force itself that gives us the opportunity to provoke and engage high level salespeople, at the same time bring in people who can support high-volume accounts that are premature. So the US is a well stratified sales force and Germany, in places like Japan, we're really at the basic building stages. And so the investments there are a little more filling empty slots and making sort of territory coverage’s is right.
Isaac Ro: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. It seems like for the third quarter in a row, China, on the procedure growth side, is exceeding your expectations. And seemingly, you're at capacity or you thought you’re at capacity in the fourth quarter. And yet, this is still kind of – your capacity utilization seems to be creeping higher, anything to explain that? Are there certain types of procedures that are maybe just quicker? And that as a percent of the mix in China is different than the U.S.? Or can you explain what might be driving this?
Gary Guthart: I think, at the top line, what's going on here is, high belief in value of the procedures and the technology and a willingness to expand the number of hours that people are able to get procedures. I think the biggest effect is that which is a willingness to work on weekends and for them to expand to after-hours use of devices. That will dwarf the underlying which procedures in the mix. But Marshall, you can clean up that answer, if you like. 
Marshall Mohr: It's absolutely right. I mean, this is all about – it's a theoretical capacity that you're quoting. And that capacity – that theoretical capacity is based on just averages that we see around the world. Be careful of averages, and in China, they are operating on Saturdays, Sundays and late at night in order to get things done. So I think Gary's answer is right.
Gary Guthart: I think there's also an opportunity for us to learn from their experiences, which is under capital constraint, what kinds of barriers can they remove to get both good outcomes and high volumes. And I think that's exciting for us. And we have an open mind toward how we're approaching it.
Richard Newitter: Great. And then maybe just one follow-up on Japan. That's the other area where you're kind of seeing capacity constraint. And so you get additional – on the procedure side, at least, until you get additional approvals. Can you maybe just remind us the key procedures that you're hoping are up for consideration next year? And maybe – which ones represent the biggest market opportunities, and do you feel there's any that might be further along with the approval agencies over there?
Gary Guthart: In terms of maturity, there are some that have been going through clinical trials and have a lot of data behind them and others that are using kind of existing data sources. So the one that has the most structured data so far is gastrectomy, and that is going to be exciting for us over time. It's a real market in Japan. The prevalence is quite high, and so we have good hopes and optimism that, that will go through the process. Other categories are things like GYN oncology, which is of interest, saw lobectomy, Calvin, there are some others that…
Calvin Darling: Yeah. Lobectomy procedures and some of the lower colon LAR procedures are potential.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. So I think the interest in broad use of da Vinci in Japan is very high. We do not have assurance of that MHLW will accept it in the next insurance cycle. Although, so far, so good. And we don't have assurance that the reimbursement levels will be any particular level. And again, so far, the indicators are pretty good for us, but that's still a work in process from the government's evaluation point of view. And we stand by to support the surgical societies to answer questions for them as they need it.
Richard Newitter: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Larry Biegelsen: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Let me just start with hernia. You received recently a specific inguinal hernia indication, which includes positive data in the label. Could you talk about implications of that label and data? And are you pursuing other specific indications for other procedures? And I have one follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Sure. On the first one, this really is something around what gives us a little bit of freedom of – a little more freedom about what we can claim in our materials. And so it allows us to be a little bit more specific versus the general. And so for us, we think that, that just clarifies what our teams can speak about. And so we think it's an incremental positive, it's a small positive, I think the data underlying it is supportive, and the interactions with FDA, I think are ultimately helpful for the whole process. This is one of a set of specific indications that we have pursued over the last couple of years. And we do have a pipeline of the next set of things we want to do and get aligned. And we have not publicly disclosed what those are and what the order is, but I guess what I'd tell you is I expect more to come. And again, I think it's a healthy process between us and the agency to supply data as we get it and that allows us a little more specific capability in terms of what we talk about.
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks. And then I think on the – you're planning to finally launch a 45 millimeter stapler, which should help with bariatric procedures. Is there any update on the timing there? Thanks for taking the questions.
Gary Guthart: Sure. Yeah, we are working on additional staplers besides the ones that are in the market. We have a 30 and a 45. Remember, staplers are characterized by not only their length but also the length of the staples that go into jaw. There are a set of things that we're working on beyond that. We do think that there are opportunities to build staplers that can have broader use in general surgery. We have not yet predicted or publicly disclosed what the expected time lines are. We do have to take note of the enrolment and those things. Approach maturity will share with you where we are. 
Larry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brandon Henry: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Can you provide an update on the Australian clinical trial for the flexible catheter platform? And any lessons you've learned from that trial? And then when and where do you think we can see the data from the trial being published or presented? And a couple of follow-ups.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Thanks, Brandon. I think the short answer is no. I can't provide an update. The data is being analyzed. The clinical teams that are there are preparing abstracts and they will decide, which meeting they want to show it. And once they made a decision, then we're happy to share it with you. As we said last time, the results were very positive for us. We were really happy with what we saw. I think the scientific principal investigators need the chance to write their manuscripts and analyze the data and present it in a way that makes sense to them. So we will wait for that, and as we get clarity there, we're sure to share it with you.
Brandon Henry: Okay. And then just more broadly, can you help me understand some of the differences or the benefits for Intuitive's flexible catheter platform relative to some of the other platforms in the market, like Medtronic with its super dimension platform?
Gary Guthart: Sure. I think what we can bring in our concept and our technology here is a couple of things. One is we have novel sensing technologies that allow us to sense all the way along the catheter length with a high degree of certainty. That helps us in terms of understanding and navigating tortuous pathways. That's one. The second thing is the use of robotic assistance gives you stability and navigation capabilities that are very hard to do manually, and so those are technical benefits. What could they result in, in terms of clinical benefits? The hope there is that you can get to more distal locations that are otherwise hard to get to in tortuous pathways and that are more accurate in terms of tissue sampling because you have high degree of stability and better imaging and targeting now. Those claims have to be backed up, and so that's the hypothesis. And that's the set of trials and data and analysis that we’re going after. And I think people are excited about flexible technologies in general by some of the technologies that our competitors and other med companies have put out there. I think the excitement is there. And the question is, can you go a little further and get a little more predictability. And we think we have technologies and capabilities that can do that.
Brandon Henry: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Travis Steed with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Travis Steed: Thanks for taking the question.
Calvin Darling: Travis, you'll be the last questioner, so make it a good one.
Travis Steed: Okay. So you placed a decent amount of Si systems in the quarter. Did those customers have an option to purchase X? And just any color on how customers are deciding between the two systems, recognizing we're still very early on?
Gary Guthart: So I think the question was, either there's a fair number of Sis in the system in the quarter despite the availability of X.
Travis Steed: Yes.
Gary Guthart: Right? I think, first, while we were pleased with approval timelines of X in the U.S. and Europe, there are still many markets that X is not yet approved in. So some of the Sis are just purchases by folks whose choices were Si or Xi. In the case of China, it's – their choices Si right now, not Xi. So some of it is just that. In other cases, some of the negotiations are multi-quarter negotiations and are right at the endpoint. And so they will finish the transaction based on where they started. Those are opportunities for us to go back to those customers over time. That's one of the reasons that we had the revenue deferral and the offers for people to evaluate whether they want to make a change. So that's mostly what the dynamics are.
Marshall Mohr: And then, Travis, the other point to think about is just – the lumpy of the accruals came mid quarter, so I think Europe was in the beginning of practical and the U.S. was the beginning of May, so you didn't really have a full quarter to get out, get the team in and communicate to all your customers what X is relative to other products that may have already been in a long sales cycle.
Travis Steed: Okay.
Gary Guthart: Just a little color commentary on X. I think the customer base and our field understood well what X is, what its benefits are, I think. The logic of X is well understood and where it fits in the line is well understood. And we're pleased with that.
Travis Steed: Okay. And just one quick follow-up, I think I know the answer to this, but is it still your view we should be modeling in 2018 expense growth below you revenue growth?
Marshall Mohr: Actually, what we’ve said is that expense growth – operating expense growth will grow 18% for the year.
Travis Steed: I'm sorry, in 2018, kind of longer term?
Gary Guthart: Do we expect a while a back…
Marshall Mohr: Sorry. And in 2018, what we’ve said is, we expect to dial back so that we are adding leverage.
Travis Steed: Okay. All right. Thanks for taking the questions.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Travis. Well, that was our last question. As we’ve said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our colonization’s focus remains an increasing value by enabling surges to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve the surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q1 2017 Earnings Release Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the conference over to Senior Director of Finance and Investor Relations, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead, sir.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical’s first quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Vice President of Finance and Sales Operations. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 6, 2016. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC’s EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today’s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights; Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results; Patrick is rejoining us to discuss procedure and clinical highlights; then I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2017; and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I’ll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. This first quarter of 2017 was a dynamic one for Intuitive, with strong performance in procedures and solid growth in system placements. We are making good progress in developing deeper connections to our customers worldwide and advancing technologies and offerings that fundamentally improve surgery. Procedure growth accelerated in the quarter rounding up to 18% over the first quarter of 2016. The growth was broad-based by procedure category, as well as global region. Starting with the United States, procedure growth in both the emerging category of general surgery and more mature categories in neurology and gynecology exceeded our expectations. General surgery growth continues to be encouraging with order of early clinical reports, surgeon interest, and utilization. Procedure growth in Europe, Korea, and China were strong in the quarter. While reasons for quarter-to-quarter fluctuations can be hard to assess, we estimate that Q1 benefited from some tailwinds that will balance out through the remainder of the year. Patrick will take you through these factors in more detail later in the call. Our capital placement performance in Q1 2017 strengthened over Q1 of 2016, resulting in a growth in total placements from a 110 to 133 this quarter. As we mentioned on these calls, capital placements can be lumpy, and after a strong 2016, U.S. capital placement settled into moderate growth relative to Q1 of last year. Outside the U.S. placement growth in the quarter was a highlight with 56 systems sold in the quarter versus 36 in Q1 of 2016. The lack of a new system quota in China and limited reimbursements in Japan constrained placement growth in these regions, Marshall will take you through system placement dynamics in greater detail. Turning to profitability for the quarter, strong procedure growth and solid system placements combined with favorable product mix and improvements in product cost to lead to gross margins at the top of our expected range and solid operating margin performance. Our fixed cost growth was as expected, with significant increases in R&D spending that reflect investments and bringing new products through clinical trials on the path to market. A summary of our first quarter pro forma operating results was as follows. Procedures grew proximately 18% over the first quarter of last year. We shipped 133 da Vinci Surgical Systems up from a 110 in the first quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter was $674 million, up 13% from the prior year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $381 million, up 18%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $521 million, representing 77% of total revenue. Gross profit margin was 72% compared to 70% in the first quarter of last year. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $264 million in the quarter, up 15% from the first quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $196 million, up 15% from Q1 of 2016. In the quarter, we also entered into a stock repurchase agreement in the amount of $2 billion. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly. Turning to our product pipeline, as you know, we’ve increased our mid and long-term investments in creating our next-generation of products and services. Based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable more minimally invasive surgery, better outcomes, and to expand access to our technologies globally. To bring these investments to market, we have developed a product pathway that responds to our customer’s desire for choice in clinical capability and choice in total economics. Over the next several quarters, we plan to launch a new technology upgrade to Si, named da Vinci X that enables a compelling entry point to our advanced technologies. da Vinci Xi will remain our flagship and we will provide customers with logical upgrade paths for more affordable entry-level systems like Si and X to Si and Sp. We have submitted our documents for CE Mark review for X and anticipate it will be available in Europe in the second quarter, with clearances in other regions following over time. We’ll provide you with additional information on X as it launches. The upcoming availability of da Vinci X has some accounting implications, which Marshall will describe in greater detail later in the call. Our Sp program continues to progress in its clinical trial work and new site initiation. Cases at our active trial site in Asia have included transoral, urologic and colorectal surgery. We’re also on track in initiating our U.S. IDE sites to gather clinical data in transoral surgery. In reviewing feedback from surgeons in Asia and the latest standards for human factors validations, we have elected to pull forward a software release for Sp ahead of our urology 510(k). This will pushback our urology 510(k) submission into the back-half of 2017 and it’s likely to delay launch of Sp in the U.S. by one or two quarters. While I’m disappointed by the delay, we believe this simplifies our submission and our ultimate path to market. In our flexible robotics program, we completed our first clinical experience in Australia in the quarter. Surgeon commentary on its performance has been enthusiastic. There are finishing patient follow-up and preparing their manuscript for publication. The overall program is now in its design for pilot production phase. In closing, the first quarter of 2017 has been a busy one for Intuitive. We remain focused on the following for the balance of the year: first, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery; second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia; third, advancing our new platform, imaging advanced instruments, da Vinci Sp, and diagnostic platform progress; and finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region. I’ll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. I would describe our results in a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation, excess tax benefits related to employee stock awards, and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information, because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro-forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website, so that there is no confusion. First quarter 2017 revenue was $674 million, an increase of 13% compared with $595 million for the first quarter of 2016, and a decrease of a 11% compared with the fourth quarter revenue of $757 million. As Gary outlined, we’ll be launching da Vinci X system in certain markets pending appropriate regulatory clearances. In conjunction with the launch, we will offer customers who purchased systems in the first quarter the opportunity to upgrade, or trade out their systems for the X system. As a result, we deferred $23 million of fist quarter revenue and consistent with prior deferral, this revenue will be recognized when customers either trade out their systems, or when the offers expire, whichever comes first. First quarter 2017 procedures increased nearly 18% compared with the first quarter of 2016, and increased 2% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year and the fourth quarter has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide, and reflects the benefit of Easter Holiday being in the second quarter of 2017 rather than the first quarter of 2016. Patrick will provide more detail concerning procedure adoption. Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of $381 million increased 18% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, which closely reflects procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure compared with $1,830 last year and $1,900 last quarter. The increase relative to the first quarter of 2016, primarily reflects increased sales of our stapling and vessel sealing products, mostly offset by customer buying patterns. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns. System revenue of $153 million, which excludes the revenue deferred in conjunction with the customer trade-out program increased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 35% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects higher system placements and higher lease buyout and operating lease revenue, partially offset by the revenue deferral and lower average selling prices. The quarter-over-quarter decrease reflects seasonally lower number of systems, the revenue deferral, and lower average selling prices, partially offset by higher lease related revenue. 133 systems replaced in the first quarter of 2017 compared with 110 systems in the first quarter of 2016 and 163 systems last quarter. 21 systems were placed under operating these transactions in the current quarter compared with 19 systems in the first quarter of 2016, and 13 last quarter. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the lease – life of the lease. As of the end of the first quarter, there were 95 systems up in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $5 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter, compared with $4 million in the first quarter of 2016, and approximately $5 million last quarter. We generated approximately $10 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $6 million in the first quarter of 2016, and $7 million last quarter. Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts and revenue deferrals was $1.46 million compared with $1.5 million last year and $1.48 million last quarter. The decrease in ASP compared to the fourth quarter primarily reflects geographic mix. The decrease compared to last year primarily reflects a higher proportion of Si refurbished systems sold to cost-sensitive market segments. We expect lower price systems to be – to cost-sensitive market segments to represent an increasing proportion of our sales in the future. Service revenue of $140 million increased 13% year-over-year and increased approximately 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. First quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $183 million increased 12% compared with $164 million for the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 14% compared with $212 million for the fourth quarter. Recurring revenue increased 23% compared to previous year and 5% compared with the fourth quarter, reflecting procedure growth, partially offset by customer buying patterns. Systems revenue decreased 9% compared with the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 39% compared with the previous quarter. The decrease in OUS systems revenue relative to both the prior year and the prior quarter reflect lower system ASPs, reflecting sales of Si refurbished product to cost-sensitive market segments, revenue deferrals, operating leases fixed in the current quarter versus none in the prior year and two in the prior quarter, geographic mix, and changes in the number of systems placed. Outside the U.S., we placed 56 systems in the quarter compared with 36 in the first quarter of 2016, and 63 systems last quarter. The decrease in the system – in system placements relative to the prior quarter, primarily reflects seasonality. The increase in system placements relative to the prior year reflects higher sales into Europe, Korea, and India. Current quarter system placement included 21 into Europe, seven into Korea, six into India, six in Japan, and two into China. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy, as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 was 72% compared with 70% for the first quarter of 2016 and 71% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase compared to the prior year reflects reduced product costs and manufacturing efficiencies. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, the higher gross margin reflects a higher mix of instrument and accessory revenue relative to systems revenue. Since we deferred costs associated with the $23 million revenue deferral, the trade-out program had a little impact on our margins. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency, and in the long-term the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. Pro forma operating expenses increased 19% compared with the first quarter of 2016 and increased 1% compared with last quarter. The increases are consistent with our planned investments in product development, specifically da Vinci Sp, flexible robotics, imaging and advanced instrumentation, and the expansion of our OUS market. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.1% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.4% for the first quarter of 2016 and 26.9% last quarter. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income and with the impact of one-time items. Our first quarter 2017 pro forma net income, which excludes income associated with the revenue deferral was $196 million, or $5.09 per share, compared with $170 million, or $4.42 per share for the first quarter of 2016, and $242 million, or $6.09 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The $23 million revenue deferral, including the associated deferral, the cost of sales, and income tax effect reduced GAAP and pro forma net income per diluted share by approximately $0.28 per share. Earnings per share benefited from our $2 billion stock buyback, because our average shares outstanding were reduced by 1.7 million shares, as we retired 2.4 million shares on January 27, 2017. Our final delivery of shares under the ASR if any will be delivered at the end of the contract period. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $180 million, or $4.67 per share for the first quarter of 2017, compared with $136 million, or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016, and $204 million, or $5.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP net income for the first quarter included $21 million of litigation charges compared with $2 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $6 million last quarter. The first quarter charges included approximately $14 million for the estimated cost of settling product liability claims covered by tolling agreements. We’ve made substantive progress resolving over 90% of the tolled cases. The remainder of the first quarter charges is related to a settlement of the dispute over a license and supply agreement. Beginning in 2017, we were required under GAAP to report the excess tax benefits, or deficiencies associated with employee stock awards in our tax provision rather than as an adjustment to paid-in capital in prior periods. The excess tax benefit included in our GAAP results for the first quarter was $33 million, contributing $0.85 per share. We have excluded this benefit from our pro forma result. This amount will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the volume of employee stock option exercises and the number of RSUs vesting. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.1 billion, down from $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. The decrease reflects our $2 billion stock buyback, partially offset by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan: Thanks, Marshall. Of our first quarter procedure growth of nearly 18%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 14% and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 28%. Procedure growth benefited from tailwinds from the shift of the timing of the Easter holidays from Q1 into Q2, which had the greatest impact on our European business. Excluding the benefit from these tailwinds, our procedure performance exceeded our expectations during the quarter. The United States both mature and growth procedures such as general and thoracic surgery outperformed our plan. Though difficult to assess, strength in the U.S. may have been due to a short-term uptick in patients seeking care ahead of any potential healthcare reform. In U.S. urology, the first quarter growth rate for da Vinci prostatectomy was similar to 2016. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. Earlier this month, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF proposed a change to its 2012 guidance around PSA screening from recommending against screening at any age to encouraging individual patients and physicians to consider PSA screening for men aged 55 to 69. We are pleased to see the USPSTF more closely aligned its recommendation with guidelines from the American Urological Association. In U.S. gynecology, first quarter procedure growth sustained trends observed during 2016. Procedure growth in U.S. GYN appears to be driven by consolidation of surgeries towards physicians that specialize in complex and cancer surgery, who tend to be users of da Vinci system. First quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in the United States and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains encouraging. Trends in lobectomies and other thoracic procedures continue to show early-stage adoption. Turning abroad, procedures outside of the United States – procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 28% in the first quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, general surgery, and gynecology. As I mentioned earlier, the shift of the timing of the Easter holidays from Q1 into Q2 serves as a tailwind in the quarter, likely contributing an estimated 3% to our 28% procedure growth outside of the United States. Procedure growth was led by Europe, China, and South Korea. In Europe, procedure growth benefited from the Q1 calendar tailwind, but also showed strength on an organic basis. Procedure growth in China was driven by a strong expansion in system utilization. The system placements remain constrained pending the issuance of the new quota for civilian hospitals. In South Korea, procedure growth is driven by a mix of specialties and procedures in addition to a recent uptick in system placements over the past several quarters. Recently, procedure growth in Japan as well as dVP penetration has grown above 80%. During the quarter, clinical study being conducted to support a reimbursement submission for gastrectomy completed an enrolment. Over the past several months, new clinical evidences highlighted the role of da Vinci in treatment of gastric cancers in Asia. Case series comparing da Vinci to open or laparoscopic procedures have emerged from both South Korea and Japan. Dr. Yang and colleagues from Yonsei University Health System compared all three modalities of surgery across nearly 1,000 patients, an article published in the Annals of Surgical Oncology. The authors found that the da Vinci patient cohort had the highest rate of surgical success compared to open or laparoscopic procedures, while experiencing a reduction in major in hospital complications, a reduction in positive resection margin, and improved lymph node yield. Dr. Uyama and colleagues from Fujita Health University published a letter in the Annals of Laparoscopic and Endoscopic Surgery highlighting prior work on over 500 radical prostatectomies for gastric cancer. The authors found that exchange for greater blood loss and operating time. da Vinci prostatectomy was associated with a reduction in complications and length of hospitalization compared to laparoscopic gastrectomy. In addition, the authors found that da Vinci patient cohort included a larger proportion of advanced gastric cancers, proposing that da Vinci technology was best for these patients. Looking forward, during the second quarter, we expect our procedure growth rate outside of the United States to slow, as the calendar tailwind becomes a calendar headwind of similar magnitude during Q2. As we move throughout the year, we also expect the contributions from China and Japan to moderate until we obtain a new quota and place new additional systems in China, and obtain additional procedure reimbursements in Japan. The first quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I wanted to highlight two additional publications. Dr. Luwan from Baptist Hospital of Miami and colleagues published results from nearly 300 right colectomy patients in the Journal of Surgical Laparoscopy Endoscopy & Percutaneous Techniques. Comparing da Vinci surgery with intracorporeal anastomosis to laparoscopic surgery with extracorporeal anastomosis, the authors found that while patients in da Vinci cohort have longer operating times, they experienced less blood loss, shorter incision lengths, and longer specimen lengths. Other clinical endpoints that trended towards improvements in da Vinci patient cohort include readmissions, post-operative complications, lymph node yield, and zero incisional hernia repairs compared to 7% in the laparoscopic cohort. The next publication is from Dr. Leon and colleagues from the McGill University in Montreal Canada published an article in the Journal of Gynecology-Oncology on the associated – to their hospital from adopting da Vinci surgery for gynecologic-oncology. The authors reported that the introduction of da Vinci increased the use of minimally invasive surgery from 15% to 76%, increasing the volume of patients treated by 27% and decreasing in-patient board cost by approximately $5,000 per patient, despite a higher proportion of patients with complex comorbidities, the authors concluded, “Organizations are beginning to recognize that the economic implications of introducing the robotics program extend beyond the operating room. It is timely to evaluate the broader ripple effects robotics has on hospital departments outside of the operating room.” This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2017. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full-year 2017 procedure growth of 9% to 12% above the approximately 752,000 procedures performed in 2016. Now, based upon favorable trends and key markets outside of the U.S., U.S. general surgery growth and solid results in mature U.S. procedure categories, we’re increasing our estimate for 2017. We now anticipate full-year 2017 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 14% We expect the Q2 procedure growth, procedure rates – procedure growth rates, particularly in Europe will reflect fewer operating days than in the previous year. In regards to system placements, 21 of our 133 first quarter system placements were structured as operating leases. Going forward in 2017, we expect an increasing proportion of system placements to be under operating leases. We have recently expanded our leasing programs in Germany and Korea and in the U.S. more customers are considering operating lease arrangements to acquire da Vinci capacity. The average selling price for system sold outright will vary quarter-to-quarter based upon factors, including product, regional, and trade and mix. With the upcoming expansion of our value-oriented system offering and increasing placements in the cost-sensitive markets segments, we expect that our average system selling price will trend gradually lower in 2017. As we have described, approximately $23 million of product revenue was deferred in Q1 related to our da Vinci X trade-out program. In future quarters, we expect to defer additional revenue related to da Vinci X trade-out offers that we will make to customers in the U.S. and other markets ahead of the availability of the product. We will recognize revenue at the point the trade-out offers are executed or when they expire. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2017 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect our full-year 2017 gross profit margin to be in the upper-half of that range. Turning to operating expenses. As we have described previously, we have accelerated our investments in several strategic areas that will benefit the company over the long run. Accordingly, we have ramped our operating expenses as we focus on execution. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2017 operating expenses to grow between 15% and 18% above 2016 levels. We now anticipate coming in at the higher-end of that range. Consistent with our last call, we expect non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $190 million and $200 million in 2017 compared to $178 million in 2016. We expect 2017 other income to be between $30 million and $35 million, compared to the $25 million to $30 million range forecast on our last call. With regard to income tax. Consistent with previous guidance, we expect our 2017 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5 and 28.5 of pre-tax income depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. During Q1, we had $38.5 million diluted shares outstanding for EPS calculations. As Marshall described, in connection with our accelerated share buyback program, on January 27, we took delivery and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, representing the initial delivery from Goldman Sachs. Based upon the timing of this transaction during the quarter, about 1.7 million shares were reduced from our Q1 share count. The remaining 700,000 of the 2.4 million share reduction will be realized in Q2, reflecting the full quarter impact. The final delivery of shares under the program, if any, will be delivered at the end of the contract period in November. Beyond the accelerated buyback, our actual Q2 shares outstanding will also be affected by the impact of employee option grants, share price, and other diluted share calculation inputs, as well as any other buybacks. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Go ahead please.
Robert Hopkins: Hi, yes, good afternoon. Can you hear me, okay?
Gary Guthart: We can.
Marshall Mohr: We can.
Robert Hopkins: Great, good afternoon. So, I guess, the first thing I’d like to ask about is your announcement on da Vinci X. And it sounds like if you’re deferring revenue now that the timing of this is fairly imminent. So is it safe to assume that X will be launching this calendar year?
Gary Guthart: We plan to launch in Europe first and we are in the process of the CE Markreview. We expect that we’ll pass through that review in the next quarter or so.
Robert Hopkins: And then there are couple of other follow-ups in terms of U.S. timing. And then, Gary, can you just describe this a little bit more? I think you said it was an add-on to Si. I’m just curious is this technology primarily a lower-priced offering, or is it going to be positioned as a tool for new settings, or new surgical markets? I just wanted to try to get a better understanding of what kind of new market opportunity that this is addressing?
Gary Guthart: Sure. So let me describe a little bit of what it is first. It really combines our latest instrument accessory, robotic, and computing and imaging technology with an Si patients cart chassis. This brings to market advanced upgrade package for Si technology that’s lost between the Si and the Xi in terms of its breadth of clinical reach. And it creates an attractive entry point for either an upgrade or a new install. I think that it will do well in places that Si does well today and adds to it some of the Xi technologies at an attractive economic place. Where that goes in terms of treatment locations, we’ll see. I think it will be well received.
Robert Hopkins: And then lastly, I guess, on da Vinci X. Can you just talk about what sort of difference in price point are we talking about here? And what sort of difference in functionality if it’s primarily addressing similar kind of surgical opportunities, I’m just curious to any sense for what’s the ASP difference and the functionality difference that would be very helpful? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yes. You’ll have to wait on ASPs. We aren’t announcing it at this time just directionally it will be between Sis and Xis. In terms of capability, again, we’ll, as we launch, we’ll give you additional information in terms of future benefit. It isn’t foundational in terms of the types of procedures it can do. It will make Sis more capable to more comfortably do more procedures. So Xi will remain the top of the line. Xi has intraoperative table motion. It has automated help and set up an optimization and multi quadrant functions that X will not have.
Robert Hopkins: And could it launch in the U.S. this year, that’s my last question?
Gary Guthart: It is possible, but we haven’t yet called the end date in terms of launch time.
Robert Hopkins: Okay, great. I’ll get back in queue. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Amit Hazan with Citi. Go ahead please.
Amit Hazan: Thanks. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Let me just start maybe with the da Vinci Sp delay and just ask for a little bit more color just specifically what happened to get you to drive that delay? And then also other than the software upgrade, are you pretty much ready for the 510(k) filing in terms of the clinical results you wanted to have?
Gary Guthart: Yes, the clinical side has been really good. We’re feeling great about our clinical experience and overall product performance. We do – we did learn some things in our trial that we want to make a little easier, it has to do with making it a little bit easier to set up and a little bit smoother and optimize workflow. We decided that, given the extensive HF, human factors validations that are required by regulators these days that we would rather do that sooner ahead of the submission than later. And so, we made a decision to go ahead and pull that software release forward into those validations on the newly released software. So I’m not foundationally upset about where we are with regard to Sp. You get out and you learn. I’d like to take those learnings and put them back in the product and get on with it.
Amit Hazan: And just two quick questions on guidance. First, on the gross margin side, I think, I want to try to understand you had another really good gross margin quarter and your guidance is still kind of a little bit below where we were last year. But it seems like the same drivers are in place, lower cost and new products, managing fixed costs well. So I’m just trying to understand if this is conservatism by you, or if you’re actually starting to think about some of the – maybe da Vinci X products coming through and that’s why the guidance is lower, what else is the offset versus what you’ve been able to achieve over the last five quarters?
Calvin Darling: Yes, Amit, this is Calvin, and we’re definitely pleased with our Q1 gross profit results and our continued progress to reduce costs and improve efficiency, as Marshall took you through. And as such, we did take up our guidance to the upper-half of the 69% to 71% range. But you look at specifically in Q1, the gross margin of 72% in the quarter benefited from product mixes, 77% of our revenue is from higher margin recurring revenue and 23% came from lower margin capital. Also during the quarter again, we had very few charges associated with field actions, excess, obsolete inventory. So as we look forward into the balance of 2017, we think the margin will be impacted by things, including of course, capital sales comprising a higher proportion of the revenue and that mix factor, there will be some costs start to build up that – to support the manufacturers some of the new products. We are assuming a higher field action and charges more aligned with historic ratios. And then, as I talked about in the prepared comments, some directionally lower system ASPs as we expand our value-oriented system offering and increased placements in the cost-sensitive market segments, and of course, the margin will vary quarter-to-quarter.
Amit Hazan: Okay. And then just lastly, for me on – is on the procedure guidance. So if I’m kind of hearing you correctly putting all the pieces together, you had some selling day impact that you’re calling out for the first time really, I’m assuming you kind of knew that ahead of time, so I don’t know how much that has an impact on your new higher guidance, but maybe a comment on that? And then, in addition to that, you talked about strong kind of legacy growth, but your legacy growth was right in line with where it’s been more recently. So I’m just wondering is the net effect that the higher guidance for you comes really from general surgery in the U.S., that’s what’s driving the higher number?
Gary Guthart: Yes, there’s a lot of factors. Again overall, we’re again very pleased with our Q1 procedure results and growth trends, and we do expect 2017 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and international procedures. We’re still very early stages of adoption in these categories. And again, we raised our guidance in the quarter from 9 to 12 to 12 to 14, so it’s reflecting our increased confidence overall. But at the end, we feel like our Q1 results were exceptional in the quarter. And going forward, we would expect some moderation in growth in Asia, as Patrick took you through as we await additional da Vinci procedure reimbursement in Japan and sales growth in China. We do expect moderation in the European growth rates due to the timing of the Easter holiday, slight moderation in U.S. mature procedures, which have continued trends, as you mentioned. But dVP and GYN, we’d assume some moderation there. And then just, the overriding uncertainty and policy direction in the United States and what impact that may have.
Amit Hazan: Fair enough. Thanks, guys.
Gary Guthart: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Just a few quick ones. Gary, just starting off with da Vinci X. for a second here, I wonder what the upgrade electronics package on da Vinci X. Is it going to be possible to upgrade the X with Sp, meaning, will that tower work with Sp, so potentially you can bring Sp to a broader marketplace than we initially thought, which we thought maybe was limited to just Xi?
Gary Guthart: Yes. So it’s a good point, is the – the answer to that is ultimately, yes. But the competition or hardware platform and the basics are shared across all three X, Xi and ultimately Sp. So in addition to giving people lower entry point on advanced technologies, it gives them logical upgrade pathways to advanced technologies.
David Lewis: Perfect, very clear. And then Gary, just two more quick ones. One on Sp, does this software upgrade, or software pull forward, I should say, does that impact to the timing of the second and third filings you were forecasting out ahead than others?
Gary Guthart: It does not appear to.
David Lewis: Okay. And then, Gary, the one procedure we talk a lot about prostate, we talk a lot about hernia lately. But this thoracic procedure, or segment has really come into the dialogue the last six months. Can you just talk more about what’s happening in thoracic? How much of it is long resection? How much of this is broad category of VATS surgery? And any you can share with us in terms of market size, stage of inflection, because it’s sort of merged from a nice place to a definitive driver, it’d be helpful to get some clarity? Thanks so much.
Gary Guthart: Sure. I think just painting it broad strokes, the opportunity for us in thoracic surgery over time is real. There’s a lot of open surgery in that space. These are complex procedures and delicate surgeries. As we think that sets us up well for da Vinci kind of platform, as we have brought Xi to market with its longer reach, its narrower arms and its set of Xi staplers that has helped. So we’re seeing what would amount to early interest and early growth in that category. In terms of market sizes and rate of penetration, I – I’ll let Patrick speak to that a little bit. We still think we’re early. I would also say that, we’ve got our sales force and commercial team really focused primarily on general surgery. I think we want to support that market very well. But Patrick, take it away.
Patrick Clingan: If you look at the United States market, there’s probably around 100,000 patients who receive surgery a day, split evenly between lobectomies and other types of thoracic procedures for which we think our products can bring value to patients and surgeons. We look outside the United States beside, markets are much, much larger, particularly when you look to Asia and China in particular. So we’re optimistic about the future. But we’re still in very early days and you’re seeing some of the early evidence that’s come out comparing robotics to open and even VATS surgeries with their improving outcomes and evidence holds up over time. We think there’s a runaway for us here.
David Lewis: Great. Thank you very much.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Go ahead please.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I’ll start off with just a couple of clarifications on procedure expectations. Are you factoring in any impact from the USPSTF guidelines? And then, can you comment on hernia ventral versus inguinal? Are you still seeing relatively balanced growth rates between the two?
Patrick Clingan: Hey, Tycho, it’s Patrick. From a USPSTF perspective, in 2012 when the original announcement came out, we saw dVP volumes decline over a couple of year period. However, since then you’ve seen our volumes really return to nearly the level they were in 2011. So I think a lot of that has played through, so we’re pleased to see the statement become more aligned to what the AUA society guidelines are. From a ventral and inguinal hernia perspective, we remain encouraged by the trends we’re seeing. You continue to see growth in our existing surgeon populations doing more and more procedures, new surgeons coming along. And there’s a lot of positive energy coming out of society meetings like the American Hernia Society and the SAGES meeting. So we continue to be pleased by the adoption that we’re seeing.
Tycho Peterson: And then on Sp, I know you suggested the software release would necessarily impact the timing for follow-on procedures down in urology. Can you maybe just help us think of when you may have those filings for the follow-on procedures? And also, when can we get a readout from the first clinical experience in Australia? Is that something that would be published.
Gary Guthart: Okay. So two different things there; one is Sp and one is our flexible robotics program. But just going to Sp to start, we have not yet settled on submission timelines for the additional indications on Sp beyond urology. We are imminently initiating the transoral surgery trials, and then we’ll open colorectal trials thereafter, but we have not yet set dates publicly for when we expect those submissions. That said, the software update we’re doing vis-à-vis the urology filing should not disrupt the timeline of those two. With regard to the work that was done in Australia that was on the flexible robotics platform, they are in patient follow-up now. So they’re following patients after their treatment for the prescribed amount of time in their protocol. I’d expect them to be presenting publicly in the fall.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Go ahead please.
Tao Levy: Great, thanks. Good afternoon. So I had a question on the X – on the da Vinci X. Are the instruments similar to the Xi, or it’s still going to be a different course set of instruments?
Gary Guthart: Good question. The instruments on X are the same family as the Xi, so there are generation 2 advanced instrument kit. So things like stapling and vessel sealing, or gen 2, they are the same exact instruments, same part numbers as the Xi likewise with the imaging system. So if you’re on account that has multiple systems, you have Xis and Sis then moving to X can standardize your Si base and have one set of instruments and accessories.
Tao Levy: Gotcha. And the pricing pathway for an upgrade from an Si to and an X outside of obviously the deferral?
Gary Guthart: So not – we haven’t published yet what the list price steps are going to be.
Tao Levy: Okay And just lastly, I asked this question last quarter, I’m just wondering if there’s any update on the quota from China? Is that still something you expect over the near-term? Thanks.
Marshall Mohr: There really – this is Marshal. There really isn’t much of an update as we’ve previously communicated. We’re still waiting for a quota, which would cover the civilian hospitals in China, and we’ll keep you informed as we hear.
Tao Levy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brandon Henry: Yes, thanks for taking my question. First, can you talk about the dynamic? You mentioned of patients coming in for surgery ahead of potential healthcare reform changes, and what you heard from surgeons regarding that dynamic? And then should we expect this similar dynamic to occur in the second quarter? And I have a couple of follow-ups?
Gary Guthart: This is Gary. I don’t think we have a deep insight there. There has been a little bit of speculation that there has been some pull forward. We have seen just in the numbers a little more buoyance kind of broadly across our procedure base not just in the single category, but kind of across each category, which leaves us to believe there’s something environmental going on. I would not say that we have special insight. I think it’s a little bit of speculation we’ll know in the future quarters. I cannot predict what will happen Q2, Q3 with regard to how ACA dynamics will occur.
Brandon Henry: Okay. And then and separately on the international side, I think the company breaks at international procedures by prostatectomy, hysterectomy in kind of other bucket. The other bucket has become the larger portion of the international procedures, but we don’t really have a lot of visibility into the underlying trends there. So can you just spend sometime discussing what specific countries our procedures are driving that continued 30% plus growth in the other bucket and your confidence that that rate of growth continuing for the other category going forward? Thanks.
Patrick Clingan: Yes, sure, Brandon, it’s Patrick. We continue to see most of our outside of the United States procedure growth being driven by urology, mostly prostatectomy and dVP, but also in kidney repairs, mainly through partial nephrectomies to which the system tends to be an enabler for population of patients to access partial nephrectomy for kidney cancers. We also do see encouraging signs in general surgery and gynecology, stronger in Asia and in certain markets in Europe, where we’ve already deeply penetrated urology.
Brandon Henry: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please.
Lawrence Biegelsen: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, if I focus on the pipeline, any updates on the new technologies that you’re working on the imaging agent and additional instruments? And I had one follow up.
Gary Guthart: Imaging trial on the uro imaging agent is initiated so far so good. We’re still early in that trial, but we’re pleased. Otherwise our imaging programs are progressing against our plan. Your second question was on, I’m sorry advanced?
Lawrence Biegelsen: Additional instruments?
Gary Guthart: Instrumentation. We have a portfolio of instruments we’re working on nothing to really call out in terms of dates for you. We are making progress on expanding our stapler line to be a full line stapling system, but nothing I call out for you on this call.
Lawrence Biegelsen: Gary, let me ask one on the competition. So Medtronic has talked about bundling their surgical portfolio to drive sales of their robot assuming they have a competitive offering. Can you talk about things you could do such as partnering to mitigate that advantage that they could have? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: We think – the way we think about it in terms of servicing our customer is to allow them to have a minimally invasive surgery program that they get the outcomes they want to across a broad population of patients and surgeons. We think that our technologies are outstanding and we’ll continue to be market leading. To the extent that they need to augment a robotic system with other products, there are a plethora of other companies that are happy to sell into surgical suites. And I think as long as those were at an economically attractive price point and the products are well accepted, I think, we’re going to be in good shape.
Lawrence Biegelsen: All right. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Hi, thanks a lot for squeezing me in here. I just the first one, coming out of SAGES, we noticed just a palpable kind of acceptance – increased acceptance of hernia procedures in general, multiple kind of podium sessions devoted to it. So just wondering, is there that acceptance that you’re seeing, so that we saw do you guys feel that kind of there has been a notable inflection in the acceptance of kind of hernia robotic hernia surgery? And would you be willing to kind of give us an updated kind of sense of where we are on the market opportunities within ventral and hernia – inguinal how big they are and kind of where you think that could go from your addressable market?
Gary Guthart: I think in the first part of your question where are we in acceptance? I think that you’re seeing some early exploration and enthusiasm and we’re feeling that enthusiasm as well. But as you well know the surgical population is not of one mind. And I think that we’re going to see pro-conned dates in hernia for sometime, and I would expect that. And I think it will be challenged and debated and discussed variance by patient population, variance by surgical technique, and variance by total economics to treat. That leads to your second question, which is are we ready to make any changes to our thoughts on estimated market size? And I think it’s really too early to try to redraw boundaries there. So the summary for us is so far so good. I think, surgeons are finding real value and pursuing that value. They’re doing what I think they should in terms of assessing it carefully and publishing the results and debating, which patient groups and subgroups make sense, and we’ll support them in that effort.
Richard Newitter: That’s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the ACA kind of some of the dynamic that might be playing out in the marketplace. I’m just wondering on the capital side and on the decision-maker side of the equation and hospitals institutions, any updates on what you’re hearing from customers on kind of their willingness to invest in innovation like robotics?
Gary Guthart: I think on the one hand in a good way a lot of people understand the basic value proposition of robotics are familiar with the kinds of things they can do. So that has led to, I think meaningful conversations that are data driven and effective. I think on the margins right now, the ACA has injected some caution on the part of capital buyers. So on the positive side, I think, robotics the value it can bring is pretty well understood. On the negative side, I think, on the margin at the outside it’s been – ACA uncertainty has been a slight negative.
Richard Newitter: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Wise with Stifel. Go ahead please.
Rick Wise: Good afternoon, everybody. Hi, Gary. Just a big picture question, first. I mean, I would assume you’d think that the opportunity for robotics and surgery is under penetrated. I’m just sort of fascinated with the several times you’ve mentioned – you Marshall, Calvin had mentioned that average selling prices will trend lower because of new products and mix here. Just stepping back from both specifics, how do we think about the opportunity for a lower-priced system perhaps driving increase penetration? I mean, is this the next leg in robotic market penetration? And does da Vinci X and Sp and should we think about that more specifically as one of the next big opportunities as opposed to just a procedure, or a geography if you see what I’m getting on?
Gary Guthart: I’ll answer a little simpler question that you asked. I think we have been in close contact with our customers, particularly those outside the United States and have been listening carefully to what kind of procedures they want to do, what the reimbursement environments are in their countries, and what kind of capabilities need to match that procedure set and reimbursement set, and we think X fits that bill. And as a result, I think that it will be well received. I don’t think it’s limited to a single country. I do think that we believe and I think our customers believe the total cost to treat is the right economic measures, that better outcomes followed by economic analysis to look at total cost to treat. And to the extent that your technology offering can match that, so that you get both great outcomes and lower total cost to treat that will drive adoption. How big, how fast X goes? We don’t have a crystal ball. But we have invested in it based on some conversations and research we think was right. I think that is going to hit the mark for them, and we will be delighted to report to you in future quarters how it’s going.
Rick Wise: Yes. And Gary, just a follow-on to that. So just to be very clear, I mean, this is not, “Just an upgrade for existing Xi installed base, it is that, but it’s definitely something much broader potentially”?
Gary Guthart: You can – if one has an Si then you can upgrade to Xi to an X. If you have no system and you want to get started then you can buy an X to get started.
Rick Wise: Yes. And you didn’t mention, I know it’s small table motion this quarter. Just out of curiosity where are we with adoption and the uptake there? Is it going as you expected and planned?
Gary Guthart: Yes. At the top level, attach rate of table motion has exceeded our initial expectations and kind of our original business plan for that product. I think with regard to the last quarter, I would imagine, I look at Patrick about…
Patrick Clingan: Very solid attach rates with new Xi system sales. We’ve worked largely through the existing population of customers. So we are not seeing as much on a year-over-year basis as we saw when the product launched.
Rick Wise: Okay. And then just last for me on Fosun. Any milestones we should expect and, let’s say, the next 12 months on the program? And maybe just more broadly, how do we think about this partnership’s impact, if anything now looking ahead on the broader high surge Chinese business, and especially given the complex geopolitical situation? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Okay. With regard to Fosun, I think, I’d focus the audience on really two things. One is the technical progress of the flexible robotics platform, because we think that’s a major component. And then the other one will be our activities in building that organization, hiring staff. As the organization builds out, then we’ll announce to you kind of where we are. I gave you an update on where we are in the flex robotics program. We are very bullish on the interest in and the value that robotic surgery can bring to China. We have the right partner in Fosun. Over time, that partnership exists today in the form of our distribution relationship with one of their subsidiaries in Chindex, that will grow into the relationship into a full JV. And we will navigate the international waters as need be.
Gary Guthart: So thank you for the question. That was our last one. As we’ve said previously, while we focus on financial metrics, such as revenue, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things, which really make a difference. This concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and look forward to talking to your again in three months.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q4 2016 Earnings Release Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Note that Patrick Clingan who routinely participates on these calls will not on the call today to attend to personal matters. We look forward to this return next time. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 2, 2016, and 10-Q filed on October 19, 2016. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results, then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights, and provide our financial outlook for 2017. And finally, we’ll host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. Intuitive was founded on the mission to expand the availability of minimally invasive surgery, increase its efficacy and decrease its invasiveness, and the fourth quarter capped a strong year in pursuit of this mission led by continued growth in da Vinci procedures and expansion of our installed base. Annualized global procedure growth was approximately 15% in the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year. Trends and procedures were consistent through the year with increased use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, continued growth in neurology in Japan and Europe, and multi-specialty growth in Korea and China. Mature procedures in the United States including prostatectomy and hysterectomy outperformed our initial expectations, largely due to macro trends and diagnosis of prostate cancer and treatment patterns for hysterectomy. Procedure growth in Europe, Korea, and China were healthy through the year. Procedure adoption in Japan was solid for those procedures that have been reimbursed. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. Our capital placement performance in 2016 strengthened over 2015 resulting in a growth of total placements from 492 in 2015 to 537 this year. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our clinical install base grew from 3597 to 3919 in the year. Our range of capabilities and price points, and our ability to be flexible with acquisition methods has allowed us to meet varying customer needs in a competitive capital environment. Customers have chosen our most capable system to da Vinci Xi and roughly three quarters of new capital placements for the full year. da Vinci Xi is well matched with procedure opportunities in thoracic and general surgical procedures such as colon and rectal surgeries. US capital placement stood out in the year, while capital placements in Asia were consistent with prior trends. As we've said in prior calls, system quotas in China and reimbursements in Japan temper placement growth and make it hard to predict. Turning to Europe, while procedure growth was solid in 2016, system placements declined versus 2015 for reasons that vary by country. And our largest European markets we believe the long-term procedure and system opportunity is significant, with further adoption benefiting from additional economic validation in mature procedures like prostatectomy and from country-specific clinical and economic data for emerging procedures like colorectal surgery. Overall, despite the slowdown in capital in 2016, we are positive about our long-term prospects in Europe and continue to develop our organization and invest in European clinical and economic data to support our customers. Turning to highlights of our fourth quarter operating results. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the fourth quarter of last year. We shipped 163 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 158 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was 757 million, up 12% from prior year. Pro forma gross profit was 71.1% compared to 69.9% in the fourth quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to 386 million, up 19%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was 521 million, representing 69% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of 320 million in the quarter, up 9% from the fourth quarter of last year and pro forma net income was 242 million. up 8% from Q4 of 2015. Highlights of the full-year of 2016 are as follows. Procedures grew approximately 15% over a full-year 2015. We shipped 537 systems in 2016, up from 492 in the prior year. Revenue for the year was $2.7 billion, up 13%. Pro forma gross margin was 71.6% for the full year compared to 68.2% in 2015. Total recurring revenue for the year was $1.9 billion dollars and represented 71% of total revenue. Pro-forma operating profit for the year was $1.2 billion, up 22% from 2015 and pro forma net income was $879 million, up 20%. As we mentioned in mid-December, our Board of Directors increased our stock buyback authorization to $3 billion and we announced today an accelerated repurchase program in the amount of $2 billion. We retain the flexibility to act on the remaining $1 billion in authorization in parallel with the ASR. Overall, we are committed to the thoughtful return of excess capital to shareholders and believe our buyback program will serve shareholders well. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly. As our business is strengthened, we have increased our mid and long term investments in creating our next generation of products and services. These investments are based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable more minimally invasive surgery, better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. Our current da Vinci Sp system met its development goals in the fourth quarter and we initiated its first clinical feasibility study. As we've discussed on prior calls, we plan first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. Sp is a platform technology that allows high dexterity access with great 3D vision to confine surgical spaces. Early surgeon response to Sp in the trials has been very positive. We anticipate initiating a Sp IDE trial in the United States for Transoral Robotic Surgery as well as submitting a 510-K for urologic applications both in the first half of 2017. We're also making good progress on our flexible robotics platform. First targeted to address the acute need and diagnosis of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection is important. The technology underpinning the system is based on computer controlled catheters, advanced image processing and sophisticated sensing. As we mentioned previously, this system is in its early stages of our human clinical experience. This experience has been compelling and our design and operations teams are working hard to incorporate feedback and complete its production design and supply chain optimization. Given the long-term opportunity for this system in lung cancer detection and other potential applications, we've been growing our team in this space. We do not anticipate revenue from this product in 2017. Imaging and intelligent algorithms offer significant opportunities to enhance surgeon capabilities. Our investments include hardware and image processing updates to our Xi platform to enhance imaging performance and reduce costs. We're also investing in contrast agents for specific anatomical structures recently announcing our plan to commence Phase 1 trials for the ureter imaging agent compatible with our Firefly imaging hardware and software.  Imaging and intelligent algorithms work also includes processing and presentation of pre-operative imaging and other offline data for use during surgery, sometimes called augmented reality or mixed reality technology. We've been working on these technologies for several years and more recently with our partner InTouch Health. Our next step in mixed reality technology is working in prototype form in laboratory settings today and will move towards first human use in 2018. Bringing new platforms to the market represents a significant investment and we expect to invest up to $80 million more in 2017 than our typical operating expense run rate growth. These investments are focused on clinical and economic data, particularly in Europe and Asia expansion of our operations capability to include da Vinci Sp, investments in our diagnostics platform and continued investments in imaging. Calvin will take you through the spending implications later in the call. In closing, entering 2017, we are focused on the following. First, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery. Second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia. Third, advancing our new platforms; imaging, advanced instruments, da Vinci Sp and diagnostic platform progress. And finally support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region. I'll turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. I would describe our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro-forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results in our website so that there is no confusion. Consistent with our preliminary press release on January 11, fourth quarter 2016 revenue of 757 million, an increase of 12% compared with 677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 and an increase of 11% compared with the third quarter revenue of 683 million. Fourth quarter 2016 procedures increased 15% compared with fourth quarter of 2015 and increased 9% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year and the third quarter has been driven by general surgery in US and urology worldwide. The increase relative to the prior quarter also reflects procedure seasonality. Revenue highlights are a follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of 386 million increased 19% compared with last year and increased 11% compared with the third quarter of 2016. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately 1,900 per procedure compared with $1,840 last year and $1,870 last quarter. The increase relative to the fourth quarter of 2015 primarily reflects increased sales of our stapling and vessel sealing products. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns. System revenue of 236 million increased 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased 15% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects higher system placements and higher revenue associated with lease buyouts and operating leases, partially offset by lower average selling prices. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects higher system placements partially offset by lower lease buyout revenue and lower average selling prices. 163 systems replaced in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with 158 systems in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 134 systems last quarter. 13 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the quarter, including our first two into Germany compared with 16 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 15 last quarter. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. As of the end of the fourth quarter, there were 79 systems out in the field under operating leases, we generated approximately 5 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and approximately 4 million last quarter. We generated approximately 7 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 13 million last quarter. We exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculation. Globally, our ASP was 1.48 million compared with 1.55 million last year and 1.53 million last quarter. We sold a higher proportion of Si refurbished systems in India and Europe in the quarter as we see cost sensitivities in certain segments of these markets. Service revenue of 135 increased 12% year-over-year and increased approximately 4% compared with the third quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflected growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the US, results were as follows. Fourth quarter revenue outside of the US of 212 million decreased 4% compared with 219 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased 12% compared with 189 million for the third quarter. Recurring revenue increased 24% compared with the previous year and 10% compared with the third quarter reflecting procedure growth and distributor buying patterns. Systems revenue decreased 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased 14% compared with the previous quarter. Outside of the US, we placed 63 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 75 systems in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 49 systems last quarter. The increase in system placements relative to the prior quarter reflects seasonality. The decrease in system placements relative to the prior year reflected ten fewer systems into China where we await a new quota and four fewer systems into Brazil where we are in the early stages of market adoption. Current quarter system sales included 26 into Europe, three into China, 15 into Japan and 19 into rest of world market. System placements outside of the US will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Total pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter was 71.1% compared with 69.6% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 73.1% for the third quarter of 2016. The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 included 7.1 million of medical device tax refunds which benefited the third quarter gross margin by approximately 100 basis points. Excluding this impact, the decrease in gross margin relative to the third quarter reflects a higher mix of systems revenue and higher scope repair costs. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects reduced product costs and manufacturing efficiencies. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument in accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency, and in the long term the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. Pro forma operating expenses increased 23% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased 14% compared with last quarter. The increases primarily reflect increased headcount, increased product development activities and investments in our OUS commercial organization. We accelerated some operating expenses into the fourth quarter in anticipation of spending growth in 2017. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26.9% compared with an effective tax rate of 24.9% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 22.7% last quarter. The pro forma third quarter 2016 tax rate reflected 16 million of tax benefits or $0.40 per share realized as a result of the statute of limitation expirations in various jurisdictions. The fourth quarter of 2015 tax rate reflected a full-year benefit associated with the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, whereas R&D credit has been recognized ratably during 2016. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of US and OUS income and with the impact of one-time items. Our fourth quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $242 million or $6.09 per share compared with $224 million or $5.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 and $246 or $6.19 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Excluding the one-time income tax and medical device tax benefits, pro forma net income for the third quarter of 2016 would have been $225 or $5.65 per share. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $204 million or $5.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 and $211 million or $5.31 per share for the third quarter of 2016. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of 4.8 billion, up from 4.6 billion as of September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. During the quarter, we repurchased 55,000 shares for $34 million. In mid-December, the Board of Directors increased the amount authorized for stock buybacks to 3 billion. Today, we entered into a $2 billion accelerated stock buyback program with Goldman Sachs. The total number of shares repurchased will be based on a negotiated discount to the volume weighted average price of the stock over the contract period which is expected to end in the fourth quarter unless terminated earlier by Goldman Sachs. Goldman is expected to deliver approximately 2.4 million shares representing the initial delivery within the next week. We will retire these shares as soon as practical thereafter. A final delivery of shares under the program if any will be delivered at the end of the contract period. Under our agreement with Goldman Sachs, we have reserved the ability to repurchase additional shares in the open market up to the Board's authorization during the accelerated stock buyback period. And with that I'd like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over procedure and clinical highlights.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Marshall. Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was approximately 15% as US procedures grew approximate 13% and outside the US procedures grew approximately 23%. For the full-year 2016, global procedure growth was also 15% overall, 13% US and 24% OUS. In the United States, fourth quarter procedure trends were similar to the third quarter characterized by strong general surgery growth, continued relative strength in gynecology and modest EVP growth. Full-year 2016 US procedures totaled approximately 563,000 growing approximately 13% compared to 11% in 2015. Fourth quarter US general surgery procedure adoption remain strong led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery as surgery retention and expansion remains encouraging. Full-year 2016 US general surgery procedures totaled approximately 186,000 reflecting growth of approximately 33% compared to 31% in 2015. In US gynecology, fourth quarter procedures again grew modestly year-over-year with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Procedures for other benign gynecologic conditions also grew modestly. Full-year 2016 US gynecology procedures totaled about 246,000, up approximately 3% compared to growth of approximately 1% in 2015. In US urology, fourth quarter da Vinci prostatectomy procedures grew at low-single digit rate consistent with third quarter. We believe that our US prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. Approximately 70,000 dVPs were performed in the US in 2016, up approximately 5% compared to 11% growth in 2015. Full-year 2016 US urology procedure volume of approximately 109,000 grew approximately 7% compared to approximately 12% in 2015. In other US procedures, early stage lobectomies and other thoracic procedures was strong during the quarter and year. These set of procedures are particularly well served by our da Vinci Xi product and 30-millimeter stapler products. Turning abroad, procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 23% in the fourth quarter and approximately 24% for the full year 2016. Growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures. Total procedure growth in Asia overall was strong, notably so in key strategic markets of China, Japan and Korea. In Europe, procedure performance varied by country. Approximately 190,000 procedures were performed outside of the US in 2016. As Marshall mentioned earlier, our average instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure increased on a year-over-year basis largely attributable to the adoption of our stapling and vessel sealing technologies. During the fourth quarter, one of the first studies on our EndoWrist stapler was published in the Journal of Laparoendoscopic & Advanced Surgical Techniques by Dr. Holzmacher and colleagues from the George Washington University School of Medicine. In their small case series comparing an EndoWrist to a laparoscopic 45-millimeter stapler for colorectal procedures. The authors found that the EndoWrist stapler was safe and effective while using fewer stapler fires reducing the cost per procedure by approximately $150. The author stated advantages of the robotic stapler include large range of motion and 90 degree articulation. The robotic stapler has a comparable level of safety as a 45-millimeter laparoscopic stapler and is more cost effective. Beyond the stapler study, Q4 was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Dr. Cigdem Benlice and colleagues from the Cleveland Clinic of Colorectal Surgery Digestive Disease Institute recently published a study titled Robotic Laparoscopic and Open Colectomy, a case matched comparison from the ACS NSQIP. The study aimed to compare perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing robotic, laparoscopic and open colectomy using the procedure targeted database of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, ACS NSQIP. Robotic laparoscopic and open groups were matched one to one to one based on age, gender, body mass index, surgical procedure, diagnosis and ASA classification. Out of the 12,790 patients, 387 fulfilled criteria per group after matching. Univariate comparison showed operating time was longer and hospital stay was shorter in the robotic group. Important complication rates including morbidity, superficial SSI, bleeding requiring transfusion, ventilator dependency and ileus rates were demonstrably lower in the robotic group. The authors concluded that the ACS NSQIP data demonstrated several short-term advantages of robotic surgery compared with laparoscopic and open surgery. I will now be providing you with our financial outlook for 2017. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement last week, 2016 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 15% to roughly 753,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2017, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 9% to 12%. We expect 2017 procedure growth to continue to be driven by US general surgery and procedures outside of the United States where we are still in early stages of adoption. Our 2017 procedure growth expectations are directionally lower than the 2016 results based upon the following assumptions for 2017. Moderating growth in our mature US dVP and gynecology procedures that benefited from favorable macro trends in 2016, moderating international procedure growth as we await additional da Vinci procedure reimbursement in Japan and additional system sales quota in China, and lower percentage growth in US general surgery of a larger base of procedures. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2016 as we have experienced in previous years, with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. With respect to revenue, as we have mentioned previously, capital sales by their nature can vary from period to period based upon many factors including hospital response to the evolving health care environment under the new US administration, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas and competitive factors. Within this construct, we'd expect 2017 capital sales to follow historical seasonal patterns. Turning to gross profit, as Marshall described our full-year 2016 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.6% as we ended the year at 71.1% in Q4. In 2017, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69% and 71% of net revenue. We are projecting a modestly lower gross profit margin in 2017 reflecting the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar on OUS revenue and margin, non-recurrence of the medical device tax refund recognized in 2016, higher costs associated with new products and directionally lower system ASPs as we see incremental market interest in our lower priced offerings in certain geographic markets. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter to quarter depending largely upon product and regional mix. Turning to operating expenses, as Gary and Marshall described, we are accelerating up to $80 million in investment in several strategic areas that will benefit the company over the long term. Consistent with that direction, we expect to grow pro forma 2017 operating expenses between 15% and 18% above 2016 levels. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between 190 and 200 million in 2017 compared to 178 million in 2016. We expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $25 and $30 million in 2017. With regard to income tax, consistent with our 2016 guidance, we expect our 2017 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5 and 28.5 of pretax income depending primarily on the mix of US and international profits. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Margaret Kaczor: Good afternoon, everyone. The first question for me is you guys have been pretty busy announcing, obviously, the R&D spend. You’ve got the ASR, so clearly you guys are seeing a ton of opportunity. And so to that end, how should we think about the composition of the business three years from now, five years from now, whether it’s based on disease state or sales channels, ASCs versus hospitals, or even product categories, so diagnostics, surgery, or even postop?
Gary Guthart: This is Gary. I think in the next few years, I would expect the business categories to be more or less as we describe them now. I think over time as Sp comes into the market, it will feel like surgical device in the kind of settings that you're used to, we do see increasing use of our products in ASCs, it’s not a dominant part of the business at this time. I do think it will grow over time. And then on the diagnostics segment, too early to tell what those segments will break out into. I think it's a platform. I think over time, it will broaden. In the early stages, we'll be talking to you about lung cancer diagnosis as it comes out.
Margaret Kaczor: Great. And then on the imaging side, there is a few angles to come at it. And so, I think, Gary, you have talked about delivering therapy through energy, potentially, so I guess what would that mean to you? And then, has anything changed on your view of your willingness to bring in house either radio or chemiluminescent agents or do you prefer partnerships, and that would include the [indiscernible] agent that you talked about earlier?
Gary Guthart: Yes. So, there were kind of two different concepts in the question, so I’ll just tease them apart a little bit. On the imaging side of showing surgeons more of what's going on during surgery, we really view that in kind of three different buckets. There's better hardware, better imaging sensors and endoscopes, we've been working on that diligently and releasing updates to that product line on a pretty regular cadence. There's analytics and image processing that is more software based. We've also been working hard on that and have been increasing our investments. And then the last one are kind of better sensors, better contrast agents like the [indiscernible] agent. In some of them, we do the primary part of the design in house. In other places, for example on agents we have an active licensing and co-development effort going on. So we really partner that activity with others and a little bit of everything in between. So that was the imaging side. On the therapeutic side, pretty early to tell. I do think the flexible robotics platform; the computer controlled catheters have the ability to ultimately deliver therapy. What exactly that looks like will be disease state dependent and is likely to involve different kinds of technology over time. Too early for us yet to call where that ends up.
Margaret Kaczor: Great. And then one more, maybe for Marshall. How should we think about the cadence of the $80 million in spending? And why shouldn't we continue to expect it to go up in 18 and beyond, given the opportunities in this long-term horizon that we've been talking about? Thank you.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. So to be clear, what we said was we would accelerate spending of $80 million. We would expect to more normalize our margins in future years. As far as the cadence within the year, spending particularly as it relates to engineering and prototypes and so forth can be pretty lumpy. So we haven't given you specific guidance, but I think you should expect it will go up as we go through the year.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. A question on expectations around Xi for the year. For starters, you mentioned historical seasonal patterns. It sounds like you are not factoring any ACA-associated slowdown in the first half of the year. And then in the back half of the year, how should we think about maybe incremental placements ahead of the Sp rollout?
Gary Guthart: For starters, the first question on ACA, our sense here is that utilization probably won't change very much. We don't have a crystal ball, but so far the early indications are that will be stable. On the capital placement side, highly uncertain for us. We don't know. Early indications are that it's pretty stable, but depending on how policy ultimately is implemented, that uncertainty may roll through some capital planning processes for some of our customers. I wouldn't call it out yet. Not clear that that's happening, but it's a potential.  With regard to kind of timing in the year and Sp, I’ll let Marshall answer the question.
Marshall Mohr: From an Sp perspective, what we've been communicating is consistent with what I'll say now, which is that Sp will contribute very little in terms of revenue in 2017 and will be more of a factor in 2018.
Tycho Peterson: But in terms of driving incremental upgrades to Xi ahead of the rollout, should we think about any dynamic there?
Marshall Mohr: Not really. No.
Tycho Peterson: And will we get Sp data at SAGES? When can we start to think about some early user feedback?
Gary Guthart: We should have the opportunity to close this clinical feasibility trial and then initiate the IDE head and neck trial in the first half the year. And as the one closes and the other opens, we’ll be in a better position to share with you that feedback.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then last one on hernia. Can you just give us an update of where we are from a penetration standpoint in terms of both inguinal and ventral and how you think about the relative growth rates this year?
Calvin Darling: Yeah. Generally speaking, we think we're still in fairly early stages on both the ventral and the inguinal opportunity. You saw, we talked about the results in general, surgery again up over 30% this year. Obviously, we had a lot of new procedures and we gained confidence as the year went on I think regarding our opportunity on the inguinal side with demonstrated stickiness on surgeons and growth in that category. But it's still difficult for us to assess how many, let's call it the close to 300,000 ventral hernias and 700,000 inguinals will ultimately be robotic candidates, but we feel pretty confident that it's going to be driving growth for us into 2017 and beyond.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Thanks. So Gary, I have a question for you. From a signaling perspective, this quarter is very interesting because you are accelerating $80 million expend and you are announcing a $2 billion ASR, so those are two very positive signaling events, in my view. I was just wondering, can you just help us understand why now is the time to be doing these things? What are the things you are seeing to give you confidence in the business, or am I not phrasing it correctly, that the $2 billion ASR is really just to offset the spending?
Gary Guthart: I think our process to get to both of these, I just described how did we get to accelerating investment and how do we get to the ASR. With regard to accelerated investment, I think we are feeling good and increasing confidence in the use of our products in general surgery. I think that while we're still in early innings, I think the early results have been really strong, so that has been positive for us. As we look at where we sit on kind of the competitive landscape with regard to technologies and opportunities both here at home and abroad, we also are feeling confident that we have a very good technology pipeline and our positioning is quite good. And so as we look at then the opportunity to invest, our first priority is to fund the existing business. The second priority is look for organic growth opportunities that can drive profitable growth in the future.  That's where that 80 million is going and we evaluate platforms and we look at total available market for those platforms, estimate what the probability might be and stack rank them and then invest. We look for acquisitions as a third priority or a thing that can add to our company. And if we have excess capital, then opportunities to return it to shareholders. And so we walk through that process this year carefully and robustly and that led to both the pull forward of investment because we think there's opportunity and momentum and the opportunity to return some cash to the buybacks. And so those time together more by process than by some algorithm.
Bob Hopkins: Great, that's very helpful. And then, just the one thing I wanted to follow up on is -- not asking you to commit here, but at least is there the potential for 2018 to be a year where you have three new product platforms, Sp, potentially biopsy, and then on the new imaging agent side? Does that potential at least exist?
Gary Guthart: I think Sp is the furthest along of the new platforms and I think that Sp in ‘18 has the opportunity to do some interesting things should we execute well on our regulatory pathway. Molecules, the molecule side of imaging is further out than ‘18. There are some interesting things in imaging that are in ’18 that are more software and hardware related as opposed to molecular component. On the diagnostic platform, we're not ready yet to kind of anchor revenue expectations. I would not expect much in the ’18 timeframe, although I think we're going to make great progress on the technology and the learning on it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Gary, I am just trying to put the spending into perspective here. It seems hard to us that on individual trials, you could pull forward the magnitude of spending you are pulling forward. So is it safe to assume that at least some significant component of this pull forward does relate to a new platform that you are working on? That is number one. And then not just the R&D spending, Gary, the other piece was there is commercial spending. Can you help us understand the areas that you are spending on commercially that are different than the true R&D investment?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Fair questions. On the first one, absolutely the incremental spend relates to building out second platforms. Sp has a lot of shared components with XI, but not entirely shared components. And so bringing that out has a new supply chain and a new set of testing and manufacturing resources that have to get invested in and in addition to some of the trial work. So that's a platform. The diagnostic side, we're really excited about and we think there's a great opportunity at home and abroad and so we're earlier in that platform but we're doing what amounts to the design and early trial investments there. And then there are clinical and economic data investments on our existing platforms, particularly in Europe and in Asia where we think reimbursement or access, other kinds of access, payer access are important and that's been a data that we're happy to go, invest and collect So it really is a mix of those elements as you called out in the question.  Moving on to your second piece, remind me the second half of your question.
David Lewis: Just commercial and the non-developmental piece.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Yeah. Commercial investment. A good example of that is, we think there's real opportunity for us in the major markets in Europe if we can increase our total business footprint. It's not just commercialized and sales folks, but some of it is sales staff. We have added a seasoned executive in Germany as a German general manager. We're adding some clinical resources into Germany as well to kind of round out the team there. I think it makes a lot of sense, early returns on that are strong in terms of just their ability to get things done and so those kinds of investments have been going on. Likewise in places like Japan where we’ve been investing in reimbursements, anticipating additional reimbursement in ’18, there is some prep work to get done in terms of both the customer base in commercial as well as the government side.
David Lewis: And Gary, just a quick second question. On Sp, just to be clear, there are three approvals you talked about in this call, head and neck, urological, as well as TORS. Is it safe to assume those are the three clinical opportunities here near term? What I'm trying to get at is can you not launch Sp in more of a full commercial way until you have one of those three approvals, or that's not necessarily true?
Gary Guthart: So those are the first ideas. Which one comes first will depend on how regulatory bodies view it. I suspect urology will actually be earlier than the other ones just based on existing data and past history. We think those are good opportunities for the platform. They are not the only opportunities for the platform. So we are pursuing those to work up to those in parallel because we think it gives our customers the best financial flexibility to take advantage of the capital investment they make in the platform. Does that make sense?
David Lewis: Makes perfect sense. Thank you so much.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Thanks. Hey, good afternoon. I want to just come back to the R&D spend, the increased investment spend, for one second, just to clarify 2018 in particular. And this goes off, Gary, what I think you talked about earlier this month at the investor conference, that tailing off in 2018. And I think about that as I think about Sp, maybe that launch coming out so you get some savings there, but diagnostics, certainly imaging, seems like new and ongoing spend. So I wanted to maybe try to get you to clarify why that increased spending is just one year and not more than that. And in terms of just the R&D as a percent of sales, why wouldn't that just continue into next year? It seems like a lot of your spending is actually going to be ongoing.
Gary Guthart: Yes. So what we're describing is that we're growing R&D spend and it's really operations not just R&D. So operating expenses unusually in’17 is a run rate and we think it will return to more normal growth rates in ’18. There's a couple of reasons that we think that’s so. One of them is, the biggest spend on a platform launch is actually the year before launch. That's where both you're building a lot of products, you're doing a lot of elevations. You're getting ready, you're doing a lot of the staging. So that bolus will go through. We have been investing sequentially over time a fair amount more in imaging.  So imaging in ’17 isn't a huge bolus. It's kind of a ratable growth. And you're right, we expect revenue growth ’17 to ‘18. So we expect growth in total OpEx expense in ’18, it’s just that the growth rate will modulate relative to ’17. So what we're trying to communicate to everybody here is that the growth rate in ’17 is unusual. We’d expect revenue growth in ’18, we'd expect op expense growth rate in ’18 as well, but more aligned with historical norms, in other words, the growth rate in ’17 is not the new normal.
Amit Hazan: That's helpful. And then, gynecology would be my second question. The 3.5% growth for the year, that is better than we expected, too. I think that is another year of improving growth for your second year in a row. And you seem to be cautioning a little bit that some of this is not sustainable, that something like migration of procedures to GYN oncologists might run in due course. And it strikes me as just a little bit too early or a little bit early to be concerned about that trend. And so, it seems like a newer trend to me. I am wanting to get you a little bit to comment on whether that is a real concern for ‘17 or whether you are just putting out potential risk factors for the year.
Calvin Darling: The gynecology is one of those matured procedure categories in the United States. If you look at benign hysterectomy, the largest procedure in the category, over 80% of those procedures are performed in some minimally invasive fashion, whether it be with laparoscopy, vaginal techniques or robotic and it's kind of been that way in the last two or three years. So in that sense, we would expect, our starting thought would be, we’re likely to move with the market in that scenario. So if you look back a couple of years ago, at 2014, that's what happened. We declined low single digits. We think the total number of benign hysterectomies being performed is probably gradually declining in response to pay or pushbacks on that procedure, encouraging other treatment modalities. So ’15 that kind of kind of moved to the other side is 1% growth like I said in the comments.  This year, it ramped up to about 3% growth. And you’re right. I think it's largely reflecting a trend towards a higher proportion of the cases being performed by the gynecologic oncologists, the set of surgeons that are more aligned with robotics. So that's been a benefit. So our guidance would suggest, we'd expect this to moderate a little bit in 2017. We don't have a perfect crystal ball in this area, but at some point, we think the more complex cases are the ones being referred and you hit a certain level where that you're getting very adequate clinical outcomes with the other minimally invasive approaches. So we'll see how it plays out.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Tao Levy: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just maybe you could update us on the status of China and the quota, next steps there, as well as what is needed to get the Xi approved in China.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. So two part of the question. On the quota side, the quota is dependent upon the approval of their budget and the Chinese government budget and then allocations are then done down through MOH and then to the hospitals and so on and so forth until they get to which hospitals can buy specifically da Vinci product. They've taken the first step. They have approved, they did approve the budget at the end of 2016, so in December. However, they did not take it further to the allocations to specifics as to who gets to buy a da Vinci or how many will be bought. That process is still in motion.  It's not something we can control and frankly we don't have great visibility as to what's going on behind the curtains to get there. And so at this point, we sit and wait for the next quota to be approved. I think what we've also told people is, if you look at the last time quota was approved, it still takes some time for the hospitals to actually complete the tender process and buy product. So if you're putting together a model, looking at the last time a quota was approved in 2013, most of the systems were bought near the end of 2015. So the likelihood that there's going to be a lot of revenue coming out of a quota in 2017 is not very high. 
Tao Levy: And on Xi?
Marshall Mohr: Xi is in process. It is a long approval process. We'll tell you when we get it, which is our typical pattern of disclosure. We don't know where it is in the process.
Gary Guthart: We're encouraged. I don't see a major impediment to Xi clearance in China. And in general, we're encouraged by the response of the market to robotic surgery and to Intuitive in China. So I think in general, with the caveat that Marshall has outlined, as a whole, we look positively on the opportunity there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Larry Keusch: Thanks. Good afternoon. Marshall, in your -- excuse me, Gary, in your prepared comments, I think I heard this correctly, but you were referencing long-term investments and you were talking about investments for products and services. And I just want to make sure I heard that correctly, and if that is correct, what were you thinking about when you were talking about services?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. We provide a series of things now to the customer that are kind of an ecosystem around the product itself. So the simple things you think about are things like maintenance services, but we increasingly have access to interesting data on the use of devices, our devices benchmarking that are international and things like efficiency metrics with the use of robotic systems and in the last couple of years, we have partnered with hospitals to provide that set of data to them and to help them improve their systems and that's been a real positive for them and for us. And so that's what I meant when I said services. I think those data opportunities and benchmarking opportunities increase in the future.
Larry Keusch: Okay, great. And then, I just want to pick up on some comments that you made earlier in the month and specifically get your thoughts on as you talk about, again, some of this imaging technology and the ability to perhaps be involved in pre-procedure planning. Is the way to think about that, that would really be done with the surgeon interfacing with the imaging capabilities and the machine itself, or is there an element there where Intuitive can insert itself more from a service perspective in perhaps procedure planning? And then, the other question around that was just getting your thoughts on where you think machine learning goes as it relates to robotic surgery.
Marshall Mohr: Sure. I think to the first question of what, does it change or were we interact at the hospital, I think in the near term, the answer is yes but only a little bit. I think that there's an opportunity to look at things like preoperative images that patients are required to do as part of their diagnostic work up and to be able to use and do some post-processing and machine learning on those pre-operative images to improve surgeon’s navigation or other capabilities during the case. That looks pretty interesting. That's some of the technology I showed you a few weeks ago at JPMorgan. I think in the near term, that's how we think about it. In the long term, I do think that there are interesting opportunities for analytics as it relates to the workings of a robotic surgery program or a minimally invasive surgery program that are a little bit outside of what's happening in a single case. And that may change and provide an opportunity for Intuitive to engage conversations with the hospital in a more broad manner, but I think those are -- we’re at early days of those conversations.
Larry Keusch: Okay, great. And last quick one, just, Calvin, I know you made a mention on lobectomy, but again any color that you could provide as to the uptake and perhaps the opportunity around that.
Calvin Darling: Again like I said, I think Q4 and really throughout the year in 2016 was a positive period time for us, still fairly early in that category. We're focused in the field team more on the general surgery opportunity, but there's increasing sets of people engaging, some of the key thoracic getting some of the newer technology, I mentioned that Xi system and 30-millimeter staplers in those hands and gaining that experience and building volumes from there is something we're focused on, but I think the value is high in that procedure and the opportunity is significant in the US, but when you look outside the US to Europe and particularly Asia with higher lung cancer rates, it's pretty interesting.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Craig Bijou: Hi, guys. It's actually Craig Bijou on for Larry. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start Calvin with your comments on as part of your procedure guidance, the moderating international growth. And I want to ask, what's the risk to procedure growth, given some of the slowdown in European system sales and kind of balancing that with the strong procedure growth that you guys have said that you're seeing in Asia? So I guess in the case where your European procedure -- or system sales don't pick up again and maybe the China tender or the China quota doesn't come on board as quickly as you expect, what is the risk to that international procedure growth of 20% plus?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I mentioned it is one of the bullet points in there for the outlook for -- moderating outlook on overall procedure growth. Internationally, I think the areas I pointed out specifically were China. Marshall talked a little bit about the quarter there. The fact is that the systems we do have in China are some of the productive systems we have and our ability to continue to grow procedures now somewhat pays by our ability to get more capacity in the field. So that can be a factor in 2017. And then in Japan, we very successfully ramped up the procedures where we have reimbursement, the prostatectomy procedure and earlier stage of a smaller category in the partial nephrectomy. So I think as those procedures have ramped, you've got less room and we’re waiting additional procedures in 2018, which will be required to sustain growth. Both those markets I’d say are, we've got very positive long term use on, but some specific factors impacting 2017.
Calvin Darling: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator: Okay. And that comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had two. Just, Marshall, just on the gross margin factors in the guidance for 2017, I heard FX, I heard the med tech tax refund benefit not repeating. Could you just elaborate on the last two, and then I have one follow-up on thoracic?
Gary Guthart: I don't think we have a follow-up. So Marshall take that one and we'll go from there.
Marshall Mohr: Yeah. I think the things that can affect the gross margin are, like we said, we had some experience in the quarter with selling the lower cost systems in cost sensitive markets where we saw some success. So we'll see if that continues. It’s an end of one, but we'll see what happens. Certainly, new product introductions and new products have lower margins than our older products and so that also has an impact as we increase the sales of the vessel sealing and stapling and even though we've cost reduced them somewhat, they’re still higher, lower margin than our historical products. And so as we increase the sale of newer products, that will have a negative impact. Then the other item that we mentioned was repair costs associated with scopes and we continue to work as Gary said, iterate the imaging capability and the hardware and as we do, we’ll reduce the cost as well as improve the repairability, but that's a little ways off. And so it will happen incrementally over time.
Gary Guthart: All right. Richard, Calvin said he’ll take your follow up.
Richard Newitter: All right, appreciate that. Thank you. Just on thoracic, is there any -- can you just maybe talk about the type of surgeon that you need to target, the kind of -- and the phasing of it, because I know there are some general surgeons that perform the procedures and then you obviously have cardiothoracic surgeons and specialists? Can you just describe who you are targeting and when and can that potentially give us a sense as to when we might begin to see more of an inflection point in the thoracic lobectomy segment? Thanks.
Calvin Darling: Yeah. I’ll answer that one. I think we're still in pretty early part of the market adoption for thoracic surgery. In general, it's been engaging, thought leaders in thoracic surgery, some of whom are minimally invasive surgeons today and some of whom are predominantly open surgeon. There's a mix. It tends less to be generalist here and more to be the thought leadership in thoracic as a whole. Part of I think what's been pacing growth here is just completing the product set for efficiency and speed of case. I think we're very close now to having complete product sets, things like 30-millimeter staplers and so on and that's helped. So I think as that product set completes as we proliferate Xis in the world, that has made adoption more likely and easier. I’ll turn to our close. That was our last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you we remain committed to driving the vital few things that really make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and I look forward to speaking with you again on the next call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, as you just heard, today's conference has concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Vice President of Finance and Sales Operations. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 2, 2016, and 10-Q filed on July 20, 2016. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results, Patrick will discuss procedure and clinical highlights, then I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2016, and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. Our company performance in the quarter was solid with increasing customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements. Global procedure growth was over 14% year-over-year in the quarter. Drivers of growth centered on U.S. general surgery and growth in the use of da Vinci surgical systems outside the United States. In the United States, year-over-year growth in ventral and inguinal hernia repair continues to be strong. U.S. colon resection and lung resection also contributed to solid growth. As we've stated in prior calls, we are expecting growth rates in mature procedures in the U.S. to moderate and U.S. dVP is starting to follow this pattern, driven by the macroeconomic environment for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. In Europe, procedure growth tempered in the quarter, with some countries posting solid performance while growth softened in others. We're pleased with growth in procedures in Asia, with Korea and China in particular demonstrating continued strength. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. We placed 134 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 117 in Q3 of 2015. While we offer a range of models and price points, our most capable model da Vinci Xi again represented roughly three quarters of new capital placements. As we've said on previous calls, capital placements are lumpy and this quarter was no exception. Healthy placement stood out in the U.S. while placements in our European region softened relative to a year ago. Capital placements in Asia are particularly unpredictable given environmental constraints like reimbursements in Japan and quotas in China. Placements in Asia were in line with prior quarters. Turning to revenue and gross margin dynamics, we experienced some one-time tailwinds in the quarter that contributed to higher-than-expected net income. Marshall will take you through these events and our general finances in greater detail later in the call. Turning to highlights of our third quarter operating results. Procedures grew approximately 14% over the third quarter of last year. We shipped 134 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 117 in the third quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $683 million, up 16% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 73.1% compared to 69.3% in the third quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $348 million; up 17%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $478 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $308 million in the quarter, up 28% from the third quarter of last year and pro forma net income was $246 million, up 23% from Q3 of 2015. As we discussed with you on our last call, as our businesses strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in creating our next generation of products and services. We've been increasing these investments based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. We continue to enhance features and expand access to our Xi suite of instruments, accessories, and imaging products. In the third quarter, we added the ability to ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler, and Firefly to several countries. In addition, intraoperative Table Motion uptake and performance is meeting our expectations. We are continuing to invest in expansion and refinement of our base instrument stapling and vessel sealing products for our Xi platform. New system platforms continue to make good progress. Our da Vinci single port is progressing in its in-house clinical evaluations and preparations for human clinical trials expected later this quarter. As we've discussed on prior calls, we plan first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology, and colorectal surgery. Sp is a platform technology that allows high dexterity access with great 3D vision to confined surgical spaces. Commentary by surgeons after in-house evaluations have indicated strong interest in the clinical potential of this platform. In the quarter, we also announced the creation of a joint venture with Fosun Pharma owner of our current da Vinci partner in China. The JV’s first objectives are to work with ISI and Fosun to produce products that address an acute need in the diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection and treatment are important. The technology underpinning the system is based on computer-controlled catheters, advanced image processing, and sophisticated sensing. It incorporates a substantial set of proprietary intellectual property developed, owned, or licensed by Intuitive over the past several years. This system is in its early stages of our human clinical experience, and final clearance and launch targets are not yet set. That said, the raw capability of the technology is compelling, and it has the potential to perform as a broader diagnostic and treatment platform over time. Bringing new platforms to the market represents a significant investment. We have added approximately 400 employees year-to-date and expect increased fixed investments and some lumpiness in spending in future quarters as these platforms move through design, validation, data collection, and early launch. As we close 2016, we are focused on the following. First, expanding the use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including new clearances, additional clinical and economic validation, training centers and the expansion of our product offerings; third, driving our organizational capabilities and markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation, and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion. Third quarter 2016 revenue was $683 million, an increase of 16% compared with $590 million for the third quarter of 2015, and an increase of 2% compared with the second quarter revenue of $670 million. Third quarter 2016 procedures increased 14% compared with third quarter of 2015 and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. The decrease relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects seasonality. Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of $348 million increased 17% compared with last year and increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflects procedure growth and increased sales in stapling and vessel sealing products. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,870 per procedure compared with $1,840 last year and $1,810 last quarter. The increases relative to the third quarter of 2015 and last quarter reflects increased sales for stapling and vessel sealing products. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2016 also reflects the impact of customer buying patterns. System revenue of $205 million increased 18% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased 1% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect higher system placements and higher revenue associated with lease buyouts partially offset by lower average system selling prices. We generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $3 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $13 million last quarter. While lease buyouts are difficult to predict, we expect the level of fourth quarter lease buyouts to be below those of the third quarter. 134 systems were placed in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 117 systems in the third quarter of 2015, and 130 systems last quarter. 15 systems wereplaced under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 15 last quarter and 13 systems in the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. As of the end of the third quarter, there were 74 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $2 million in the third quarter of 2015 and approximately $4 million last quarter. We exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculations. Globally our average system price was $1.53 million compared with $1.61 million last year and $1.56 million last quarter. The decrease is compared with prior periods; primarily reflect a lower mix of dual console systems partially offset by a lower mix of trade-in systems in the third quarter of 2016. Service revenue of $130 million increased 10% year-over-year and increased approximately 1% compared with the second quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Third quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $189 million increased 25% compared with $151 million for the third quarter of 2015 and increased 2% compared with $185 million for the second quarter. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of the 26% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25%, and increased systems revenue of 24%. The increase compared to the second quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 2% and recurring revenue growth of 2% in a seasonally slower quarter. Outside the U.S. we placed 49 systems in the third quarter compared with 37 in the third quarter of 2015, and 51 systems, last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 18 into Europe, two into China, 11 into Japan, and 18 into rest of world markets. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles of vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 73.1% compared with 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015 and 71.9% for the second quarter of 2016. The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 included $7.8million of medical device tax refund. Without the medical device tax refund, our pro forma gross margin would have been the same as the second quarter or 72%. Compared with the third quarter of 2015 the higher gross margin reflects reduced product costs, the medical device tax refunds, and manufacturing efficiencies. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of system and instrument and accessory revenue, cost associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency, and in the long-term the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. Pro forma operating expenses increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased approximately $6 million compared with last quarter. The increases reflect increased headcount, increased product development activities, and investments in our OUS commercial organization. We added over 400 employees primarily into product operations area over the past year. The increase compared with the prior quarter primarily reflects increased headcount costs. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.7% compared with an effective rate of 18.4% for the third quarter of 2015 and 27.8% last quarter. The pro forma third quarter of 2016 tax rate reflected $16 million of tax benefits or $0.40 per share realized as a result of the statute of limitations of expirations in various jurisdictions. The third quarter of 2015 tax rate reflected $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third-party. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of OUS and U.S. income and with the impact of one-time item. Our third quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $246 million or $6.19 per share compared with $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $220 million or $5.62 per share for the second quarter of 2016. Excluding one-time income tax and medical device tax benefit pro forma net income would have been $225 million or $5.65 per share. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $211 million or $5.31 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.6 billion, up from $4.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. And with that I would like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan: Thanks, Marshall. Of our third quarter procedure growth of 14% U.S. procedures grew approximately 11% and outside of the United States procedures grew approximately 25%. During the first three quarters of 2016 global procedure growth was nearly 16%. In the United States taken together growth in our mature procedures slowed in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. General and thoracic procedure growth remained healthy. In U.S., urology third quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy slowed to low-single-digit growth a level that we believe to be similar to the overall rate of diagnoses of new prostate cancers. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. In U.S. gynecology third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the third quarter. Procedures for benign gynecologic conditions grew modestly during the third quarter, continuing a trend from the first half of the year. Third quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains encouraging. Cholecystectomy procedures declined in the quarter, with growth in multi-port procedures being offset by declines in single site procedures. Early-stage adoption of Lobectomies and other thoracic procedures is encouraging. Last month at the Global Symposium on Robotic assisted in minimally invasive hernia repair, several new datasets comparing da Vinci to open and laparoscopic hernia repair were presented. Among the most notable presentation, Dr. Rosen from the Cleveland Clinic presented new data on retro muscular ventral hernia repair from the American Hernia Society's Quality Collaborative or the AHSQC. In a perspective cohort of more than 400 patient's case match between da Vinci and open surgery, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce the length of hospitalization by 2.5 days compared to open surgery with similar levels of wound outcomes, readmissions, and re-operations. Intuitive is a founding partner of AHSQC and we're supporting its expansion to include data for inguinal hernia repair. Turning abroad procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the third quarter led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures. Total procedure growth in Europe and Asia was similar to the first half of the year, though procedure performance varied by country. Strong growth continued in China, South Korea, Japan, and Germany. While adoption of da Vinci and urology is the primary driver for procedure growth outside of the United States, we are seeing multi-specialty adoption in certain countries. In China, roughly half of the year-to-date procedure growth has come from categories outside of urology. In South Korea approximately 60% of the year-to-date procedures have come from categories outside of urology. We're investing in the development of clinical evidence to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery in markets around the world. Globally, we support several evidence initiatives and registries including AHSQC, gynecologic oncology societal registries in the U.S. and Europe and the colorectal registry in Europe. In the U.S. we are also supporting several comparative perspective and retrospective multicenter studies on hernia repair, colorectal surgery, and thoracic surgery. Outside of the United States, we are sponsoring clinical studies in Japan to support reimbursement submissions from malignant hysterectomy and hysterectomy. In Europe, we provide support for studies in colorectal, thoracic, and gynecologic oncology. We are committed to developing local evidence in key markets to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery, where our technology can bring value to hospitals, surgeons, patients. Third quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I've selected a few studies which you may find interesting. Dr. Delush [ph] and colleagues from Indiana University published a study in surgical endoscopy comparing da Vinci to laparoscopic colorectal procedures captured in the American College of Surgeons, National Surgical Quality Improvement Project or NSQIP database from 2011 through 2014 including over 27,000 procedures across a range of colon and rectal resections, in exchange for approximately 45 longer operative time, da Vinci low anterior resections and right colectomies showed a reduction in conversion rate. Left colectomy is trended towards a reduction in conversion rates without statistical significance. Low anterior resections also show a lower rate of subsets with a higher rate of diverting ostomy. Across all cohorts, da Vinci surgery generated a reduction in length of hospital stay. The next study was published by Dr. Ozben and colleagues from the Acibadem University in Istanbul, Turkey, in the Journal of Surgical Laparoscopy, Endoscopy and Percutaneous Technologies. In a small case series, the authors compared their experience in performing rectal resections on da Vinci Xi to da Vinci Si. They found that da Vinci Xi was associated with an approximate 40 minutes of reduced operative time. The reduction in operative time was attributable to an elimination of double docking and hybrid surgeries in the da Vinci Xi cohort. The surgeons also found that da Vinci Xi patient population experienced an increase in lymph nodes harvested and quicker return of bowel function with a one day longer length of hospital stay. The authors concluded "The Xi generation appeared to allow shorter console times, and its broader capabilities promise to make it a lot easier for surgeons to perform this complex robotic procedure." While this study highlights the enhanced portfolio capabilities of da Vinci Xi per multi quadrant surgery such as rectal resection, our da Vinci SI installed bases remained stable in 2016 as customers continue to find value in its utilization. Taken together, procedures performed on da Vinci Si and Xi platforms represented over 95% of our third quarter procedures. This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now as we enter the fourth quarter, we continue to forecast full year procedure growth of 14% to 15%, likely towards the higher end of the range. With regard to Q4 2016 system placements, we directionally expect system placements for the quarter to follow recent seasonal trends. However, we anticipate system placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of our U.S., OUS markets are in early stages of adoption and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Recall, we placed 13 systems into China and seven systems into Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2015. As the quota in China expired in 2015 and a new quota has not yet been issued, and as we are in the very early stages of adoption in Brazil, we do not expect comparables and placements into these markets in the fourth quarter of 2016. Also, we believe that the flexibility we have offered customers in the form of operating leases has been well received. As a result, as compared to prior periods, we expect a higher proportion of Q4 2016 placements to be under operating leases, with revenue recognized in future periods. Finally, we expect to see a lower number of lease buyouts in the fourth quarter compared to the previous two quarters, given the lower number of short-term leases that are outstanding at this time. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect our full year 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be approximately 71.5% of net revenue. As Marshall indicated, the third quarter benefited from a $7.1 million medical device tax refund. Excluding that benefit, our gross profit margin would have been 72%. We expect our fourth quarter margin to be directionally lower than the third quarter, primarily due to product mix. Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will continue to accelerate. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels. We are now refining this range to 13% to 14%. Consistent with our last call, we expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income to total approximately $33 million in 2016, higher than the $30 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. With regard to income tax, consistent with previous guidance, we expect our Q4 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pre-tax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. That will come from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: Hi, thanks good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?
Gary Guthart: We can.
Bob Hopkins: Great. So I had two questions. First for Marshall, just to clarify a couple of things that were mentioned relating to the fourth quarter, and then a question for Gary on the Fosun agreement. But Marshall, I'll start with you just two quick clarifications. One, on the medical device tax that’s in $7 million, could you explain why that is one time? And then on the system sales guidance that you're providing, is that essentially suggesting that systems will be globally roughly flat in Q4? Thank you.
Marshall Mohr: Yes, sure. So the medical device tax is the result -- refund is the result of when you originally compute the tax, there is some subjective areas and we modified what we have previously filed. So we get a one-time refund, and it's over. And they have -- we've received the money, and there has been an audit. So we're all done with that. Second question had to do with the level of systems. No, I think that what Calvin said was that the systems are seasonally stronger in Q4. What he was trying to set up, however, was that relative to the prior year, there's some hard comparables given that we had some markets that are rather lumpy like China and Brazil.
Bob Hopkins: Yes, the second question on Fosun.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David --
Gary Guthart: I think Bob had a question on Fosun before he got to it, if you still have him, if not we will come back around in queue.
Bob Hopkins: I'm here. Can you hear me?
Gary Guthart: I can, go.
Bob Hopkins: Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. So I just, I was wondering if you could give us some perspective on the biopsy platform and the joint venture because it seems to me like this is an entirely new platform that you're announcing here. So I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color on what this is. Like, is this a new -- totally new system or just an add-on to Xi? Just should we think about it as being a couple of years away from commercialization? Or is it really a longer-term project? I'm just sort of wondering if you could provide some perspective.
Gary Guthart: Yes, I'll give you a little bit of an overview. We'll, of course, give you additional detail in coming quarters. It is not currently designed as an add-on. The technology is based, as I said in prepared remarks on computer-controlled catheters, along with some special sensing technologies and some image analysis. Currently, the current configuration it's in, it's a standalone. Those types of technologies in the future could be integrated into other things, and we won't preclude ourselves from doing that. We do conceive of it as a way to access the body through natural orifices and other means, where you want to follow a prescribed pathway to get to some deep place in the body and do something. Our first clinical interest is in biopsying lung cancers or biopsying suspicious lesions in the lung. We think that, that is important globally and particularly important in China. And as a result, the partnership with Fosun, who we've known through their Chindex Company for many years, made a lot of sense to us. And we're excited about it. We're not ready to give you commercial timelines yet. The technology is mature enough that we're in our initial kind of human clinical experience. That's really the very beginnings for us. And as we get greater clarity on our launch timelines and thoughts, we'll share them with you.
Operator: Now we'll go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Gary, I want to start with a strategic question and maybe have two follow-up boring questions. But it occurred to me on this call, actually, the Intuitive story is sort of poised for pretty significant change. I really think Intuitive has always really been about one system. I know you have multiple configurations, but in this quarter alone, Xi was still 75% of new placements. But if I think about the next two years, right, you're still going to have Xi and all those multiple Intuitive prior systems, you will have XSP, and you're also now going to have this catheter-based sensing system. So I wonder if you could help us understand, are we right to think about this company as morphing these next two years? And how does supporting sort of multiple platforms now, impact the addressable markets you can serve, your ability to accelerate growth, and obviously just flat out R&D spending across these platforms? I know it's a big question, but I think it's an important one.
Gary Guthart: Yes, fair enough. I think, as you think about SP, SP shares a lot in architecture and in kind of underlying technology with the Xi platform. We do think it branches us into places that are hard to reach otherwise, literally hard to reach with conventional technologies, open surgery, conventional laparoscopy or with Xi. So we think SP can broaden clinically what surgeons can do. I think that will start in niches and then will move out into broader applications as we gain clinical experience. It does increase our support load a little bit in terms of complexity with regard to the SP just because it's a new set of instruments and add-on accessories. But it's not an entirely new set of computational platform and things like that. As you start thinking about the catheter-based technologies, again, that's a new set of technologies. You had kind of framed in a two-year horizon. I would stretch that horizon out a little bit. I wouldn't anchor us there. I do think that takes us to different places. I think it allows access to parts of the body that you may not think of surgically. It may be more around diagnostics. And I think it will open up to practitioners' ways of approaching tissue that they just haven't thought about before. And that's why we're doing it. That you've seen us increase our R&D spend and we've been both talking about it and doing it, and part of it has been investing in these technologies. And I think it matters. I think as people look, as we look from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head and look for opportunities to get better outcomes, we think of a variety of technologies from access technologies to imaging technologies to computational technologies that can really make a difference, and that's we're putting our money where our mouth is.
David Lewis: Okay, thanks Gary. And then Marshall, the company has always been hesitant to talk about margins on a go-forward basis. Obviously, margins this year is a huge part of the story and, frankly, kind of extraordinary. So as you head into 2017, some of the spending comments you made, I don't think it's realistic for investors to expect 200 basis points of margin expansion in 2017. Based on your comments on spending in which you're going to have to just support these platforms, I mean, how should we sort of calibrate our thinking next year between sort of an extraordinary 2016 expansion and a more moderate 2015 margin expansion? Should we be thinking about something between those two poles as more appropriate than what we are seeing this year, which seems very outsized?
Marshall Mohr: Clearly, we'll give you guidance in January on what 2017 is going to look like. But some of the variables that can occur, obviously, had to do with product mix. And as you introduce new products, new products have, by their nature, lower margins than existing products. And so if there were -- as we introduce stapling, for example, we saw decline in margins initially. As we improved the manufacturability and efficiency of the manufacturing processes we see improvements in margins. So I'm not going to predict what we're going to do next year. I'd just say that there are a lot of moving parts. Mix geographically also has an impact. Mix between systems and instruments and accessories has an impact. There's just a lot of variables that go into it. I think what you've seen this last year, though, is outstanding performance by our manufacturing group to reduce the cost of newer products that were lower margin a year ago.
David Lewis: Okay. And then just really just quickly lastly, on the ex-U.S. business on systems, I think the commentary in Brazil and China, those seem kind of very short-term in nature. Eventually, those tenders will get raised. But in terms of the European business, did you see any impact from Brexit? Or do you just think this is a lumpiness that always occurs generally in your business? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yes, I think, the dynamics in UK in particular, I -- it's hard for us to segregate what's Brexit and what isn't. The capital acquisition pipelines are pretty long relative to these things. And it's been clear that in the UK, that there, NHS anyway, that NHS England has been looking at how to spend their money and trying to cover budget shortfalls. So there's been pressure there for some time of Brexit likely doesn't help. With regard to Europe more broadly, it really is varying country-by-country. Some places, we see reasonable growth and support; other countries have been a little bit more of a struggle. And the response to that really has been to increase our local presence, increase local data generation, and be in close contact with government payers and private payers.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Hey thanks. I actually want to follow-up on Dave's question early on margins. If we think about the Xi experience and the impact that had on gross margins, as we think forward to SP, is that a fair proxy in terms of magnitude of the impact on gross margin when that does rollout?
Marshall Mohr: We're not at the stage where we've introduced the product and we're manufacturing them in bulk. But I think it's fair to say that SP's margins will be lower than our existing product portfolio. And we will work on it as we come out over time and try to reduce those costs.
Gary Guthart: But in terms of magnitude, Tycho, when you look at the Xi, that was our next-generation, multi-port system, and it quickly took off to a very high proportion of the sales. What we're talking about with SP is a more controlled type of launch, lower overall quantities. So just based on magnitude, it's probably not going to have as big an impact on the overall margin.
Tycho Peterson: Understood. And then can you comment on trade-ins? I know you called out in the footnotes. You've had 58 in U.S., highest number ever. Was this kind of a one-time thing, where you kind of went back and scrubbed systems in the field?
Gary Guthart: Yes, there was a footnote within our data table that we referenced in the beginning. During the third quarter, we actually implemented a new system and some processes for tracking our da Vinci systems out in the field. As part of the transition process, we performed a verification audit out of our installed base records and which identified 43 systems, mostly older standard and S models, which had been retired. So we went and removed those retired systems from our installed base during the quarter. So I think the trade-out number was 33 and then most of the rest here was just kind of this adjustment, we made to the base. So the trade-ins were pretty, I think in line with previous periods.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Last one, I'll just ask the obligatory capital deployment question because you're over $4.5 billion now. Obviously, you're stepping up your own spending curve but maybe just talk a little bit about capital deployment at this point.
Marshall Mohr: Yes, sure. I think, we think about capital deployment consistent with how we've talked about it before. We're in a period where there is now -- we're facing future competition and we want to have the ability to expand and to deal with competition. And we're also going to see additional opportunities as companies get into this game for acquisition of technologies that may expand our marketplace and enhance our products. And those technologies, it's nice to do tuck-ins and small licensing arrangements that we've done in the past and we'll try to do those. But may be that we have to buy to pay a greater dollar to get some of that technology in the future. So we want to have money for those things. Beyond that to the extent that we have the right opportunity to buy back stock and return shares, money to shareholders, we'll take that opportunity. But we'll do that opportunistically as we had in the past.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew: Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Gary, looking at the Fosun relationship, does this give you a demonstrably closer relationship over in China that may influence the tender process? And kind of a second piece of that, from a regulatory perspective what sort of timeframes would you be looking at to get something through once you've finished developments and you've done some human testing to approval? Is it quicker there or is it similar to the U.S.?
Gary Guthart: Yes, on the first question, I think, in the long-term, I think it deepens our relationships with customers and regulators in China. I don't -- I wouldn't assume that it's a magic switch in the near-term. With regard to regulatory approvals for various products in China, typically, in our past, it's been a little bit longer process than it has in the U.S. What that looks like going forward in particular, for the new products we're talking about, I can't speak to it at this time. We just don't have enough information on it.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then you talked about international procedures being up about 25%, which is a strong number. But I thought I heard you say that parts of Europe were weaker than a year ago. Was there a particular geographic pattern there? Was China demonstrably or that plus the ROW placements sort of got my attention relative to some emerging opportunities overseas.
Patrick Clingan: Hey Ben, this is Patrick. In certain international markets, we're pretty deeply penetrated in urology. And where you have seen those penetration rates increase over time, the rate of growth has decelerated and emerging procedures things like colorectal and gynecologic oncology are still fairly small. So countries like the Nordic countries places like UK, where we are pretty deep, you see those growth rates slow.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then there's may be for Patrick as well, but a competitor this morning talked about saying seeing some of their general surgeries cases and calling out hernia being down something like 10%. Kind of give us your state of the state in terms of where you are in hernia and kind of the trajectory of adoption relative to some of the historical past adopting procedures, if you would.
Patrick Clingan: Yes, hernia continues to be encouraging. The rates of both procedure adoption, surgeon retention, and utilization within the existing surgeon population as they continue to do more procedures has been a strong point and the way in which the technology is going to be adopted. Now hernia repair though is not one thing. So there is a variety of patient's subsets within variety of different physician perspectives around the value that our technology can bring into the procedure. And so it's probably not quite like DPB in terms of the way you would think of it is been adopted, may be a little more benign hysterectomy, given the alternative therapies and the heterogeneous landscape out there in terms of how they address these patients.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then last question for me, I guess, is the question, it's around the INA, the revenue beat there with the procedures being roughly in line with our target was quite noticeable. And Marshall, you did go through some of the math there. But was other than stapling and vessel sealing, was there anything in particular in there that caught your attention relative to mix?
Marshall Mohr: Yes, just kind of giving a little historical perspective. If you look at prior to Q2 of 2016, our INA revenue per procedure has been running within our really tight, narrow range, $1,830 to $1,840 per procedure. You probably recall last quarter, it actually dropped down to $1,810, and we talked about timing of orders being the main factor here. So as expected here in Q3, we saw orders rebound to offset Q2. And if you take the average of Q2 and Q3 you're right back at the $1,840, kind of in line with those trends over the past couple of years. As we said, though, we continue to see increasing utilization of the advanced instruments, including those stapler and vessel sealer. And moving forward as we anticipate continued growth in the procedure volumes in colorectal and thoracic surgery, areas where these products are more widely used. We would anticipate a slightly higher contribution to revenue per procedure on an organic consumption model, if you will. But it is important to remember that a variety of factors impact revenue per procedure, including the type of procedure performed, the efficiency of use and optimization, use of advanced instruments, stocking orders, timing and distributors. So there is a lot of factors here. So as a result, INA can be lumpy, and future trends can be difficult to forecast in the end.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Amit Hazan with Citi.
Amit Hazan: Thanks. Good afternoon guys. Let me may be start with prostate, just kind of thinking through the trend this year, just going from low-double-digit growth in the first quarter for GDP, all the way down to low-single-digits, it sounds like, for this quarter. It seems like a pretty fast change in what otherwise would seem to me to be something that would be slower trend line. Any more color you can add as to what's happening now, why it's happening and may be, more importantly, just the confidence you guys have that this quarter kind of marched that bottom and that incident rate growth is kind of your right way to throw for prostate?
Gary Guthart: Yes, Amit, as you know, predicting how the patient treatment trends across prostate cancer in a mature procedure like DPB is difficult. We've highlighted for period of time the rates of growths that we've seen with our rates of growth that we thought were consistent with the rate of diagnoses. It's hard to say in the quarter where the rate at which we've seen growth change over the course of this year. The specifics behind it that data typically comes to us years that down the road. But we feel that what we saw in the quarter is probably more consistent rate of diagnoses than perhaps what we've seen over the past handful of quarters.
Amit Hazan: Okay. Let me kind of -- let me move to gynecology. It sounds like there things are still kind of like you described in the first half of the year may be slightly better than what we've seen in the past. And I wanted to may be ask this in a while, so I'll just throw this question out, just as one possible avenue. Just thinking about outpatient centers, ambulatory surgery centers, is there to what extent or is there kind of any increase in the success that you're having in being able to place da Vinci outpatient centers? Is that becoming more of a focus for you at all? Or is that at all a part of may be the slightly better rate of growth we're seeing in gynecology in the U.S.?
Gary Guthart: Yes. So I think you're connecting two things I'm not quite sure I'd connect. So the relative health of the gynecology business seems to me to be driven by a few factors, among them concentration of patients into higher volume surgeons and higher volume centers. Separately, there is a trend toward a more outpatient work. We do see utilization of our systems in outpatient environments that tends to be more in existing integrated delivery networks, hospital loaned outpatient departments as part of a integrated plan. It's not something I'd call out as a major trend at this point. I'm not sure that I would quite link to GYN. It's possible, but I think there are a lot of factors there that sorting them is not possible yet.
Marshall Mohr: If you look at GYN overall and you look at the history of benign hysterectomy adoption, the entrance of da Vinci surgery in the benign hysterectomy has enabled the majority of patients to now be treated on an outpatient basis. So when minimally invasive surgery is adopted with the technology, it will enable hospitals to manage these patients in a more outpatient oriented way.
Amit Hazan: One last question for me on the system side. Just thinking through not just the fourth quarter, but just a little bit longer-term may be call 2017 if you want. But thinking about the installed base, it's been really consistently growing out 10% a year almost every quarter seems like it grows about 10% -- on that 10% rate on an annual basis. Can you may be just talk through the key drivers and may be pressure points as we think about that number and the sustainability of that 10% growth in the installed base growth figure as we think through the next year or two?
Gary Guthart: A couple of -- the way I think about it kind of puts and takes. So the major factor is anticipated procedure growth by the customer. So customers are making capital placements based on what they think will happen in future procedure trends. So that is the biggest driver and where they see growth, I think that they move forward. The places where that can be a little bit different or disconnected is in a very early market where you're just getting started. So a new reimbursement clearance or a new quote or a new procedure clearance doesn't follow the more mature trend. So those are the two things that are rolling around. I think the biggest one for us is customer belief and utilization for future procedures as the best predictor of capital.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Rick Wise from Stifel Nicolaus.
Rick Wise: Good afternoon everybody. Hi Gary, just may be just going back to Fosun briefly. Obviously, you have alluded several times to this notion of building out the ecosystem and how important and valuable it is to Intuitive. Are there other similar opportunities to Fosun, whether it would be geographic or technology? Or I mean is this a direction we should expect Intuitive to push looking for other technologies to bring into the ecosystem? Is that the right way to think about it?
Gary Guthart: I think the idea that if there are technologies or other assets that we can bring that we think will increase the value of robotic surgery program or a minimally invasive surgery program based on a competition to one of our customers, is that an opportunity for us, yes. They tend to develop in time. The underlying catheter-based technologies that we're talking about now as you know, having followed us for some time were really first acquired by us years ago. So the answer to that, yes, we're outlooking. Fosun has been a good partner. They have built a relationship with us through Chindex, but they also understand the healthcare space extremely well in multiple dimensions. And so the short answer to that is we've been doing it and expect to continue to do it.
Rick Wise: Thanks. A couple more, just a general question about the general surgery adoption particularly in the U.S. May be just can you talk a little bit more about where we are just in terms of that adoption process? I mean are these still earnings or early innings rather? And may be particularly on colorectal, how do you accelerate colorectal adoption? Do we need more clinical data? Can you talk through some of those issues?
Gary Guthart: Sure. So as we said in the past, adoption is really per procedure, and per procedure is really segmented. So for example, colorectal is probably really four or five underlying procedures that are a little bit different. And adoption goes quickly when there's large value, distinct value for the procedure relative to alternatives and when the procedure is pretty well concentrated in the hands of well-trained surgeons. So take colorectal and separate it a little bit. In the case of rectal cancer, that's a complex set of procedures. Oncologic, of course, in nature has been growing steadily. Not a super rapid rise relative to some prior adoptions but a steady adoption for us and data collection has been occurring. Data publication has been occurring. And we're doing okay there. I think in other parts of colon, sometimes it's for benign, sometimes its oncology. Those are typically done by different surgeons and so they adopt at little bit different rates. You look at hernia again, it's sub-segmented, ventral hernia versus inguinal in some segments within inguinal. So we look at it. Ventral hernia and inguinal hernia, as we define the available markets for procedures for which we bring value, have adopting pretty nicely relative to past trends. Rectal has been on a slower adoption but a steady one. And colon is in the middle.
Rick Wise: And just last for me on the procedure side. I mean, obviously, a lot of moving pieces here. Urology may be now a little more slow growth now the rebounded gynecology recovering, general surgery continuing to grow dramatically. We wrote that math with what we're seeing internationally. Should we feel reasonably optimistic that something like mid-teens procedure growth, again with some variation, is that the right sustainable growth rate from here, given the growing installed base, given the geographic penetration and given the continuing evolution of Intuitive technology? Thanks Gary.
Gary Guthart: Yes, we're not ready to give of our 2017 forecast yet. And we'll see how we close here in the fourth quarter and roll up our estimates and answer that very question in our next call in January.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
Larry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So I'm new to these calls, so just may be a couple of basic ones here. So SG&A as a percent of sales was relatively low. I apologize if I missed it any reason for SG&A to be relatively low this quarter? And the R&D spending of about 7% of sales, is that sounds like is that a good rate to use going forward? And I had a couple of follow-ups.
Patrick Clingan: Yes. There's going to be variability quarter-to-quarter, lumpiness, if you will, between SG&A and R&D. We talked a lot about our R&D investments. Gary went through them on the SG&A side. I think we're investing a little heavier disproportionally for international to support the earlier phase growth there. So you look at it overall, we're within our guidance range. We refined our full year guidance to that 13% to 14%. So again, there'll be some quarter variability, but I think we're tracking to the overall plan.
Marshall Mohr: And Larry, given the lumpiness in some of our capital revenue from period-to-period, we typically talk about operating systems in terms of growth rates, which Calvin walked you through.
Larry Biegelsen: Got it. Thanks. And when we think about the pipeline and potential launches in new products and functionality, should we be expecting any meaningful product introductions later, either later this year or in 2017, excluding SP?
Gary Guthart: Well, we've been launching a fair number of instruments and accessories various things in various markets. We tend to tell you when they came out. We have not tagged a launch date either for SP or other kind of major systems at this time.
Larry Biegelsen: And then lastly for me. Gary, you talked about the growth you've seen in hernia, and you talked about ventral and inguinal. Are you seeing anything different in terms of the penetration or ramp in ventral versus inguinal or both of them equally strong? Thanks for taking the question.
Gary Guthart: It's a good question. I think the dynamics are a little bit different in them, both in terms of kind of procedure complexity and a little bit of practice patterns. But they don't track exactly the same. Having said that, I don't think there's anything about adoption I'd call out strongly at this time. I think both of them are moving through that first set of adopters, generating additional data. We're seeing more data now generally supportive and looks pretty good. I think that technique refinement and data generation is what the next round of surgeons rely upon to evaluate. And so we're seeing that kind of transition right now, clearly, in both those hernia domains. We just take one more question for one more caller please.
Operator: Our final question will come from Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets.
Brandon Henry: Yes, thanks for taking the question. So Intuitive again posted strong growth and operating margins this quarter. Can you discuss some of the product and cost initiatives that are driving these better margins and in what inning you're in with some of these cost initiatives? And then separately, the company's headcount has increased meaningfully over the last couple of quarters. Can you discuss where you're making the investments in headcount and then how much of that increase in headcount can be attributed to the Fosun JV versus some other initiatives? And then I have a follow-up.
Gary Guthart: That was two questions already, and I gave you one. I think I'll choose one. No, we'll go fast there. On the first one in terms of cost reductions, it's a careful and long list of activities that goes on. So you shouldn't so much think of it as one thing as it is a routine discipline of scanning through both operating processes and manufacturing processes and parts cost and working them down as they come. You do get the first -- the greatest help on those things in the first few years of a platform release, and then after that, it starts getting increasingly hard. Suffice it to say that it isn't possible to do it. In terms of headcount growth, it's a mixture of commercial growth little bit more weighted outside the U.S. than U.S., some manufacturing growth to cover volumes of things like instruments and accessories and other things that have been increasing as well as some design help. The headcount growth as it relates to Fosun that we're not really ready to break out at this time. We have certainly made headcount investments over the last few years into the technologies that have underpinned that relationship. But it's not -- I wouldn't call it out as Fosun just yet.
Gary Guthart: With that, I'll go ahead and close the call and then we'll catch your next question on the next conference call. So that was the last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.

In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results, Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, then I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2016. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. In the second quarter our company performance was strong, highlighted by sustained procedure growth across multiple geographies, improved margins and continued customer preference for our new products. Turning first to procedures, global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 16% with prior quarter trends continuing. Drivers of growth included U.S. general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci surgical systems outside the United States and modest growth in U.S. urology and gynecology. Inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair growth remains strong, and growth in colorectal surgery was solid. Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe, with accelerating growth in Germany. Both the Nordics and France experienced modest improvement relative to Q1 growth rates. In the U.K., growth decelerated slightly from Q1. In Asia, procedure growth in Japan was solid again in the quarter while growth in Korea was robust and accelerated over Q1 growth rate. Growth in procedures in China was also strong. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. We placed 130 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 118 in Q2 of 2015. Our most capable model, da Vinci Xi, represented roughly three quarters of new capital placements. System placement orders included an increase in dual consoles and the addition of integrated Table Motion, leading to higher feature content on average than Q1. Placements in Europe and Asia increased over Q1, while U.S. placements were up slightly up relative to last quarter. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call. Our operations teams have performed well over the past several quarters and remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing design and supply chains. Q2 was another strong quarter of operations efficiency and cost reduction performance. We plan to continue these optimization efforts as they provide significant financial flexibility for us in coming years. Turning to highlights of our second quarter operating results, procedures grew nearly 16% over the second quarter of last year. We shipped 130 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 118 in the second quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $670 million, up 14% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.9% compared to 68% in the second quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $339 million, up 14%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $467 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $297 million in the quarter, up 30% from the second quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $220 million, up 28% from Q2 of 2015. Recent launches of Xi products, including Xi intraoperative Table Motion, have been well received, as has expansion of advanced instrument lines, including our stapling products. We are continuing to invest in these line extensions to increase the value and utility of our Xi offering. We have also increased investment in advanced imaging, including significant refinements in our intraoperative 3D endoscopes, image processing for real-time and preoperative images and near infrared fluorescence imaging. Our single port, or Sp, program is progressing to plan. As Sp approaches clinical readiness, we are conducting in-house validations and initiating work with clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies. We expect first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. Over time, I expect this list of applications to evolve. As our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid and long-term investments in research and development. We have been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that a substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. We expect quarter-to-quarter variation in spending and increased fixed expenses in the back half of this year. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call. As we move forward in 2016, we remain focused on the following. First, expanding the use of da Vinci in general surgery and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair. Second, advancing our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product into initial clinical use. Third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia. And finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion. Second quarter 2016 revenue was $670 million, an increase of 14% compared with $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 and an increase of 13% compared with first quarter revenue of $595 million. Second quarter of 2016 procedures increased nearly 16% compared with the second quarter of 2015, and increased 7% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of $339 million increased 14% compared with the last year, and increased 5% compared with the first quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflect procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including stocking orders, was approximately $1,810 per procedure. This metric has fluctuated in a tight range over the past couple of years. The slight decrease in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns, partially offset by increased usage of our stapling and vessel sealer products. While instrument and accessory usage per procedure has been relatively constant, customer buying patterns fluctuate in the short term. System revenue of $203 million increased 15% compared with the second quarter of 2015, and increased 37% compared with last quarter. These increases primarily reflect higher average system selling prices, higher system placements, and revenue associated with lease buyout transactions. 130 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 118 systems in the second quarter of 2015 and 110 systems last quarter. 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter, compared with 19 last quarter, and 5 systems in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. As of the end of the second quarter, there were 66 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter, compared with $1 million in second quarter of 2015, and $4 million in the last quarter. We also generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $6 million in the first quarter, and $4 million in the second quarter of last year. We exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculations. Globally, our average system selling price of $1.56 million was approximately $60,000 higher than both the second quarter of 2015 and last quarter. The increase compared with prior quarters reflect a higher mix of dual console systems and sales of Table Motion. We introduced intraoperative Table Motion in Europe in the third quarter of 2015, and early this year in the U.S. During the first and second quarters, we recognize $1 million and $6 million of Table Motion software, respectively. Both the mix of dual consoles and number of Table Motion placements will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Service revenue of $128 million increased 13% year-over-year, and increased approximately 3% compared with the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Second quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $185 million increased 10% compared with $168 million for the second quarter of 2015, and increased 13% compared with the first quarter of $164 million. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of 16% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25%, and increased systems revenue of 2%. The increase compared to the first quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 30% and recurring revenue growth of 4%. Outside the U.S., we placed 51 systems in the second quarter, compared with 46 systems in the second quarter of 2015, and 36 systems last quarter. Current quarter systems sales included 22 into Europe, 4 into China, and 13 into Japan. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy, as some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 71.9%, compared with 68% for the second quarter of 2015, and 70% for the first quarter of 2016. Compared with the first quarter of 2016, the higher gross margin reflects reduction in product costs, favorable costs associated with our scope exchange program, manufacturing efficiencies, and higher dual console mix, lease buyouts and Table Motion sales. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs, improve manufacturing efficiency and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. Pro forma operating expenses increased 9% compared with the second quarter of 2015, and decreased nearly $2 million compared with last quarter. The increase over the second quarter of 2015 reflects increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation, and next-generation robotics, and increased head count. The decrease compared with the prior quarter reflects lower payroll taxes, partially offset by increased head count – head count costs particularly in our product operations areas. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.8%, compared with an effective tax rate of 25.6% for the second quarter of 2015, and 27.4% last quarter. The increase in the tax rate compared with 2015 reflects one-time benefits reflected in 2015. Our second quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $220 million or $5.62 per share compared with $173 million or $4.57 per share for the second quarter of 2015, and $170 million or $4.42 per share for the first quarter of 2016. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016, compared with $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015, and $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.2 billion, up from $3.8 billion as of March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we'll continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan - Finance Director: Thanks, Marshall. Of our second quarter procedure growth of nearly 16%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 13% and OUS procedures grew approximately 25%. During the first half of 2016, global procedure growth increased to approximately 16%, compared to approximately 15% in the second half of 2015, and approximately 13% in the first half of 2015. We expect our procedure growth rate to moderate in the second half of 2016. In the United States, second quarter procedure growth continued to outpace our expectations. Second quarter growth in our mature procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter. General and thoracic procedure growth remained robust. In U.S. urology, second quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market and we expect prostatectomy growth to return to levels similar to prostate cancer diagnoses over time. In U.S. gynecology, second quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the second quarter. Similar to the first quarter, U.S. single-site gynecology procedures declined compared to the second quarter of 2015. In the U.S., procedures for benign gynecologic conditions slightly grew during the first half of 2016, exceeding our expectations. Second quarter U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery, and surgeon retention and expansion remains encouraging. Cholecystectomy procedures slightly declined in the quarter, with growth in multi-port procedures nearly offsetting declines in single-site procedures. Second quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications and presentations evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I have selected a few studies that you may find interesting. Intuitive is among the founding partners for the American Hernia Society Quality Collaborative initiative, or the AHSQC, and this quarter, two preliminary analyses comparing da Vinci to open or laparoscopic complex ventral hernia repair were brought forward. The first was a podium presentation at the American Hernia Society annual meeting by Dr. Poulose from Vanderbilt, comparing da Vinci to open retromuscular hernia repair. This patient matched analysis involving data from multiple institutions found that da Vinci reduced hospital length of stay by three days without significant differences in surgical site infections, readmissions, or reoperations. In addition, a paper was published in Surgical Endoscopy by Dr. Warren and colleagues from the University of South Carolina. The authors used their institution's submissions to AHSQC to compare da Vinci to laparoscopic retromuscular hernia repair. Their study found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci reduced the hospital length of stay by one day and also enabled a greater percentage of patients to receive fascial closure and extraperitoneal placement of mesh, to which the authors attribute a reduced likelihood of hernia recurrence or bowel adhesions Next, as Marshall mentioned earlier, sales of our intraoperative Table Motion technology were strong in the quarter. During the quarter, the first clinical publication reviewing this technology was published in the international journal of colorectal disease by Dr. Morelli and colleagues from the University of Pisa. In a small case series of colorectal resections, surgeons used Table Motion to reposition the patient in an average of three to four times per procedure. The authors suggested that the technology may improve patient safety by reducing the amount of time in extreme patient positions and stated, "the da Vinci Xi plus the new operating table gives the potential to optimize gravity exposure, and provides a quick access to different surgical objectives that is important in colorectal surgery." Turning abroad, procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the second quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resections. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, second quarter procedure growth improved in Europe and was similar to the first quarter in Asia. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure performance varied by country, with strong growth in Germany, China and South Korea. In certain countries where our urology business has become more mature, such as the United Kingdom and Nordic countries, procedures continue to grow at a slower rate. Emerging procedures are in an early stage in these markets, and we are engaged with a broad range of stakeholders working to enable procedure adoption into gynecologic and general surgery. In Japan, partial Nephrectomy growth accelerated in the first quarter following approval of national reimbursement. During the quarter, a meta-analysis sponsored by the South Korean National Evidence-based healthcare Collaborating Agency, or NECA, was published in The Annals of Surgical Treatment and Research. It reviewed da Vinci and laparoscopic colon cancer resection. The meta-analysis included nearly 700 patients and found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci surgery resulted in a more rapid return of normal diet and bowel function, lower blood loss, and a shorter hospital stay. This government-sponsored health technology assessment adds to the number of HCAs has have evaluated da Vinci surgery and a broad range of procedures over the years. I will conclude my remarks by highlighting one of the largest population base studies on the impact of da Vinci prostatectomy published in the Journal of Urology by Dr. Pearson and colleagues from the University of Chicago. Using data from the national cancer database, this study includes nearly 100,000 prostatectomy patients treated with either da Vinci or open surgery. After matching the patient populations for risk factors, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce positive surgical margins across low, medium, and high risk cohorts, as well as reduce use of radiation therapy, 30-day readmissions and 30-day mortality compared to open surgery. Dr. Koch from Indiana University published a letter alongside the study titled Robotic versus Open Prostatectomy, End of Controversy, in which he stated that any debate over robotic prostatectomy should be put to rest. This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full-year 2016 procedure growth of 12% to 14% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. We are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 14% to 15%. In regards to certain forward-looking metrics, we have the following expectations. We anticipate fewer lease buyouts and lower upgrade and other system revenue in Q3 and Q4 than we saw in Q2. Second half 2016 system ASPs will likely be lower than Q2 driven by product and channel mix. We expect a directionally higher proportion of our system placements in Q3 and Q4 to come from operating leases than we saw in Q2. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will accelerate in the second half of 2016. We continue to forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels. Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016, compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income to total approximately $30 million in 2016, higher than the $20 million to $25 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pre-tax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operation Instructions] One moment, please. Okay. And our first question comes from the line of Ben Andrew of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, maybe just start out by talking about the increased investments in OpEx in the back half. Obviously, you guys have always been looking for opportunities there, but talk a bit more granularly about where those investments are coming and when we may see some payoffs. I recall it took about a year for the European investments to kick in.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. As we've said before, I think the messaging here has been pretty consistent. Some of the investments are in technology, things like Sp starting to move into field-based investment and scale rather than just the upfront D. So you're seeing some growth in that. We have some other technology investments that are a little broader. We've talked about imaging, and that's kind of a multistep process. Some of it is on the acquisition side, new kinds of endoscopes, some of it's on the software side, and some of it is in the ability to enhance our florescence imaging portfolio. Some of those things will become commercial in future quarters. Some of them are a little longer, multiyear types of investments. With regard to investments outside of R&D, you know we've been growing our investments in regions around the world where we think there's real opportunity from Japan to Germany and France and others. That'll continue. I think that be some of those investments are doing well for us. We have opportunity to perform better than we have thus far. And so the right kinds of investments there are sometimes in clinical data and clinical trials, sometimes in other market development efforts, sometimes in our resources and head count. And, again, those things can be effective from a couple of quarters out to multiyears out, depending on what the activity is.
Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then two more quick ones for me, please. In Europe, you talked about some of the investments in emerging procedures. Is that a protracted multiyear process to move beyond urology and the initial GYN procedures that you've kind of started to mature in certain geographies?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that you can see early success sooner than years, but I think broad adoption in many of these places is a multiyear process. It starts with leading surgeons and key opinion leaders and surgical society endorsement and goes from there. In some cases, we need interactions with payers and reimbursement. So I don't think have you to wait years to see the early indicators but full penetration is often more than a year process.
Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. And then finally, in the Sp, you did say head and neck. Can you be more precise? Would that be sleep apnea or is this more thyroidectomy? Do you have some initial thoughts on where specifically, please? Thank you.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so I think in the beginning it's really starting in the markets we're already participating in, so transoral more than, for example, thyroidectomy. I think this is more around surgery in the throat. And for sure there's cancer indications for that. There may be benign indications. Part of what we're talking to regulatory bodies about are clinical requirements for them to make some of those assessments and varies from what happens in Europe to what happens in the U.S. to what happens in Asia. So that will play out in time. But think of head and neck starting point as TORS. It may have other applications in neck surgery over time. I think that Sp is a pretty powerful platform, and where we start and where it evolves to will differ as surgeons get a chance to experience it for themselves.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, thanks. First question, Gary, can you maybe just provide a little bit more clarity on Sp timelines? I understand you're lining up the initial sites now. It sounds like from some of the discussions, you're really not expecting that to be much of a revenue contributor in 2017. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about how we should think about the rollout next year?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, first step here is clearances and some clinical data to support that clearance. 2017 will be really focused on data generation. While I expect some revenue, I don't think it will be a material revenue contributor in 2017. A lot of that will be building the foundation, the evidence foundation, some of the clinical work, and then I think 2018, it starts to become more of a material contributor for us. And as we get our clearances and start to solidify that timeline, we'll color that (30:45) up more for you.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then switching over to hernia, I think you talked in the past about doing some initial trial work. Can you maybe talk a little bit about where that stands in terms of any patient enrollment and how we should think about timelines around the trial for 30-day, one-year, and two-year follow-up?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll turn that to Patrick.
Patrick Clingan - Finance Director: Yeah. So, we have a number of different initiatives ongoing as it relates to sponsoring evidence development in hernia repair. The two presentation and publication that I mentioned on the call from the AHSQC is among the investments we've made in helping support surgeons bring forward the outcomes that they're getting with da Vinci compared to the alternatives.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just last one. You had noted some delays in Europe around tenders from competitive bake off (31:38). Just anything changed from your perspective this quarter?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, nothing new to note. I think that tender offers in competitive interaction is the new normal. I think our teams are doing great. I think their performance has been effective. I think we're communicating well. We have a broad portfolio that allows us to engage the customer at different levels depending on what their needs are. So nothing new to report.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions from me. Gary, one for you and then kind of a clarifying financial question. So, Gary, I appreciate the incrementally more detail you gave us in the pipeline this quarter. So two pieces. First is analytics. Can you just give us a broader sense of what the word analytics means to you in Intuitive? And then on imaging, is the next disclosure we're likely to see in advanced imaging an approval or simply an announcement of an imaging clinical study? And then I had a quick financial follow-up.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think analytics has multiple components in it. As you may know, the majority of our systems are real-time connected to the Internet today. I think over 90% of systems are online. They report back information to us mostly around the system performance itself, what it is itself is doing, rather than, say, patient information. That data can be turned into insights for the company and for our customers and we have been doing that for some time now. So there's that type of analytics. Going forward, I think that as our computational structures get more powerful, we can bring some of that intelligence more real-time. So rather than offline insights, you can start generating real-time insights. That's a multi-year pathway. I think it's interesting and challenging. I think there's long-term potential in it. But we're moving down that pathway, making sure that we have good access and fast access and low latency access to our devices in the field, and then bringing to bear information that can help surgeons as they're performing the procedure. And you'll see from us in future years a series of products that come out using that set of kind of digital pipeline. Turning to imaging, there are a couple of different things. We are releasing endoscopes at a fairly regular clip and improving that set of technologies. We made a technology change in the type of imaging we use when we switched to Xi that has allowed for faster iteration for us in the kinds of imaging we do. So there's that kind of thing that's going on at kind of a regular heartbeat. Our customers are pretty well aware of where those things are. There are other things that we've talked about, other indications for fluorescence. We're more likely to talk to you about what's happening clinically there than to announce a launch, so you'll have some warning prior to launch.
David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just, Calvin or Marshall, just thinking about the systems guidance into the back half of the year, a couple of components. I note this quarter that operating leases were down for the first time in several quarters, yet I think you said operating leases will pick back up in the back half of the year, so sort of what's the driver there? And then just on mix or ASPs going lower for systems in the back half, I'm assuming that's tied to your view of different geographies, less Xis or less consoles, dual consoles. Just give us some flavor on sort of those two dynamics, why you're so confident operating leases tick back up and ASPs tick down? Thank you.
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. So philosophically, first of all, we provide our customers leases to provide some flexibility in how they get into robotics, and it's proven out to be – to work out pretty well for both them and us. This last quarter, we just saw a fewer number than the previous quarter. The previous quarter, if you recall, was 19 (35:40). We would expect it to be more like Q1 than it was Q2, so that's the increase that Calvin was referring to. As far as ASPs go, seasonally, systems revenue is stronger in Q4. Systems drive a slightly lower gross margin than do instruments and accessories, so that mix alone will cause margins to go down. We also would expect a little bit better performance, again, due to seasonal factors in the non-U.S. markets, or the outside of the U.S., and so that mix also will drive revenues down a little. And then we expect to continue to see growth in stapling and vessel sealing in our newer technology products and those also drive slightly lower margins. So a lot of the mix will cause margins to go down in the next couple of quarters.
David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Marshall, none of these things seem to me to be new dynamics. These seem to be ordinary operating dynamics for Intuitive. Is that sort of how you see it?
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: For the most part, the seasonal things are. I think the new thing is as we drive the new product revenue, that's increases over previous quarters.
Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations: And, David, if we're talking about margins, the one thing that was kind of different in the second quarter was on the service side. You saw a pretty marked increase in the service gross profit in the second quarter. And during the quarter we were able to utilize more refurbished scopes for our scope replacement program with customers. We're going to be expanding the program as the base builds out in the second half and it's going to require a much higher proportion of new scopes at higher cost and lower margin to replenish, so that's something that will be a headwind in the second half.
David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Can you hear me okay?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We can.
Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Good afternoon. So, Marshall, just to continue on this conversation around margins, you know, because last quarter you commented on mix on how you didn't think you'd be able to sustain 70% and now the guidance is going up on gross margin. And I understand there's a lot of moving pieces here. So just from a top-down perspective, from where you sit today, when you look forward at the business, should we be thinking about low 70%s gross margin as something that can be sustained over time? Just give us a sense of what you've just been learning here in the first half of this year as it relates to a more sustainable outlook for gross margins longer term.
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, I think we've given you the guidance for the remainder of the year. We think that that's the best crystal ball that we have at this point. There are a lot of moving parts and it's hard to predict exactly where each one will come out. And so I'll leave it at that. I don't want to get into where we think it will go long term. Long term, those same moving parts will cause us to not have high confidence in exactly where they'll come out, although know that we'll manage things very diligently. As you know, last year we put in some programs to reduce the costs of Xi and Xi related product, and those have been successful, and that's part of what we're seeing here in the year to year improvement.
Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: But I mean, in terms of thinking about the biggest moving pieces, what are the things that you have us focus on as we think a little bit longer term when we try to consider what a sustainable gross margin would look like for the rest of the company?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I don't think we've put a stake in the ground and I don't think that I'm prepared to do that right now.
Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Well, no, anyway, we could take it offline. But thank you for that. And then, Gary, one other thing I wanted to ask about – two quick things. One, on just the eye-popping number of $4.2 billion now in cash on the balance sheet, and you get the question quite frequently, but I'm just curious now with this almost 20% of the market cap in cash, are there sizable M&A targets out there that you're considering and that's why there hasn't been anything incremental done with the cash? Just would love to get be an updated view there. And then you mentioned on the topic of advanced imaging and timelines for future products, you said some of these approvals could come in future quarters. I was just curious. When you made that comment, were you talking about advanced imaging specifically?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, let's speak to cash and then we'll go to the organic side. We look at the cash and think we're at an interesting point in the company's evolution here. On the one hand, I think that customer acceptance of our products has been really high. We're seeing, I think, great momentum on the clinical side in terms of clinical acceptance. We have a couple of things going on. We have some new platforms we want to bring to the market that, I think, are outstanding, are very well done and well-conceived. That will take some investment for us to do. The other thing is that we see proliferation of folks who want to enter the market with competitive offerings. And that's both an opportunity for us and a requirement for some diligence. And the opportunity is some of those technologies are interesting and may be interesting to us. Other ones are things where we may want to speed up or adjust our strategy as the market evolves. As we think about the cash broadly, our first thought is can we use the cash productively to drive future growth organically? Our second thought is are there M&A opportunities that for the long term are good for the company? The answer to both of those are there opportunities? The third are, are there other ways we can deploy capital with a long-term view for the benefit of shareholders? And that might be in buybacks or dividends or other things. So we're disciplined about thinking about capital allocation. I think this is a special time in the company's history and we're walking through how we think about cash with a fair amount of discipline and diligence. You had asked a question on product releases. Why don't you ask it again just to make sure I hit it.
Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Sure. You made a comment about the timing of new product releases and you said some will take many of these years and some of those approvals could come in future quarters. And I was just curious as to whether that was a broad comment or whether you were specifically speaking to advanced imaging.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: A broad comment. There are some imaging things that are kind of nearer product things that look a lot like what we have today and there are some long-term imaging investments. And so the submission pipeline and our regulatory interactions are a pretty full pipeline.
Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Gary, just wanted to pick up on your last answer on the imaging. If you were to sort of think about all the efforts in analytics and imaging that the company is working on and you were to take this out several years, what would be the benefits to the surgeon at that time with these technologies embedded versus what's available today in Xi?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yep. It's a good question. There's a couple of things that I think drive some of the variability that you see in surgery. So it's really interesting. If you ask the question and there's some research out there – surgery, in general, not just Intuitive, how much better in terms of outcomes and lower complications is the top 10th percentile surgeon versus the average surgery surgeon? And the spread is quite big as you look at that. There's a lot of variability in surgical performance. And so you ask the question, what drives that variability? Why? And some of it, not all of it, but some of it is that what you're looking for in visual images is subtle. Where are nerves? Where are cancer boundaries? Where are ureters? What's the right tissue to section plane? Those things are subtle and take a long time for people to internalize, and the best do it better. And so what we're trying to do here is find technologies that make it easier for other surgeons to be as good as the best. And we think that matters. Imaging will play a large role in it. So going forward a decade, what you'd really like to be able to do is mark tissues of interest in real time. Paint for the surgeon what the elements and boundaries are that allow for a good dissection or the proper resection or the best margin performance. And that's what's really directing our investments.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's really helpful. And then for Marshall, I guess, two quick ones. The per procedure revenue certainly was at a lower level than we've seen in some time. You definitely mentioned some customer buying patterns in there. So if you could just help us understand what that means. And then on China you did a number of systems in the quarter. Just wanted to figure out where we were with the quota. Are those kind of one-offs now in any given quarter?
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So as it relates to my comments on customer buying patterns, we're able to measure or look at what happens with instrument accessory usage. And from that, what we've determined is that the usage really hasn't changed a lot surgery by surgery. And so when we see fluctuations and what they're buying versus what they're using, there are times when they use more than they buy and times when they buy more than they use. And it just happens that – and it's going to fluctuate quarter to quarter, and that was my comment on the short term. And so what we saw this quarter was they used more than they purchased. And so I don't have a great explanation for it beyond that. That's just what we see. On the other hand, we have do have distributors that buy in bulk because they're holding inventory to sell to their end customers, and we do see fluctuations in those numbers as well. So the combination of the two, direct hospitals that we sell to as well as distributors, we can actually measure or identify what is customer buying pattern. I don't think – we don't see anything there that alarms us in one way or another.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And China?
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: China, China we sold four systems this quarter. Those systems were sold to military hospitals. The quota that we were selling to and couple of past years expired at the end of December. And we're awaiting for the government to approve a new quota. We don't have great information as to when that will occur.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Might describe the differences between military hospitals and non-military hospitals and vis-à-vis quotas.
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. The quota system that we had was for public hospitals, and there is a process by which we're classified as high technology and there's a quota established by the government. It's in conjunction with their normal budget process. Their normal budget process this year has been delayed, so that's why we're not sure exactly when they'll approve that and then when we'll get a quota for it. Military hospitals buy independent of those public hospitals, and we've been selling to military hospitals all along, frankly, and have a number of placements at them.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thank you.
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yep.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. Next question from the line of Brandon Henry of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, Intuitive has posted better than expected gross margins in the first half of the year. And I think we're all trying to figure out how sustainable that is. So could you help us try to quantify or maybe bucket into several categories, what were the drivers of the year-over-year increase in gross margins in the first half of the year for 2016 versus the first half of the year in 2015?
Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations: Yeah. I'm not sure we can list out item by item a specific contribution, but we have been focusing obviously on reducing costs for quite some time and managing our fixed costs, and we're really pleased with the progress. We look at where we sit, six months into the year we're at 71% on a year-to-date basis, and that coincides with the upper end of the 70% to 71% guidance range. But Q2 was an exceptionally strong quarter for gross margin. And I think we wanted to leave some specific comments there. Specifically on the product side, we would expect a higher proportion of sales of newer products, as was described in lower proportion of dual console sales, and probably more sales through distributors at lower pricing and lower margins. And I think I already mentioned previously, on the service side, we had some real benefits on the scope exchange in the second quarter, which are unlikely to continue in the second half.
Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then separately – I think you guys mentioned some slight slowing in prostatectomy growth in 2Q. Can you give us some more details on this comment and kind of discuss what's implied for prostatectomy growth in the updated guidance range? Are we now through the bolus of patients that previously deferred treatment? Thanks.
Patrick Clingan - Finance Director: Hey, Brandon. It's tough to know where exactly you are with the patient population that may have deferred treatment. What we saw in the quarter was just a slight slowing of growth from what we saw in the first quarter and the second half of 2015, or frankly all throughout 2015. How much of that is associated with having worked through any potential bolus that may be out there is difficult to predict, though, I think as you've heard us say a few times in the past, over time we do expect that prostatectomy volumes are likely to return towards the rate of diagnoses, and our recent history and the recent growth rates we've seen in 2015 or the first half of 2016, we believe, exceed that growth rate.
Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. And the next question from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, everybody. Let me start off with procedures again. I just wanted to make sure I understood the comment about the second half procedure growth slowing. Yes, I see that comps are modestly tougher. Is it something about OUS? Is it the urology sort of recovery, if you will, slowing? Can you just help us better understand your thinking there?
Patrick Clingan - Finance Director: Hey, Rick. Yeah, you mentioned the growth rate comparisons get a little harder in the second half of the year. The mature procedure contributions that we saw in the first half of the year we don't think will be as strong in the second half of the year. We continue to expect and we'll continue to drive growth in U.S. general surgery and in our overseas markets in urology and early stage of urgent procedures.
Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Back on gross margin. Clearly, it sounds from your comments that Table Motion adoption, which has been, in your words, well received, has been one factor helping margins. Where are we in sort of the penetration of the installed base, I mean, 3% converted? 50%? And, is this a tailwind now – leaving aside all of the other moving factors, is this a positive tailwind now for a year or two or three?
Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations: Yeah, I don't think I want to get into specific units on this. We're really pleased with the progress we're making and the strong market response from the customers. I think Marshall mentioned in his script we had $6 million of revenue attributable to Table Motion. It was roughly split 50/50 between new installations and systems in the field. So, again, it was a strong quarter, but I think we'll see how it heads.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The history of selling back into the installed base rather than new installs is that you have a few quarters of strong performance and then it tends to tail off. Folks who are going to be interested in it tend to move forward quickly. And then mostly it will be a go forward, so you can look at the history to sort of give you a guide as to how much that is.
Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations: Yeah. And we do have roughly around 750 or so da Vinci Xis out in the world at this point in time, and we've made some progress on that. There's still some more out there.
Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got you. And just one last one for you, Gary, if I could. At SAGES this year, it was very clear that Intuitive's messaging around looking at total procedure cost in the hospital for robotics and how much economic sense it made – robotics makes, when I listen to the looming competition from Medtronic at their Analyst Day and your friends at Verb, they're very focused on lowering per procedure robotic costs to, it seems like, in their words, laparoscopic levels. How do you react, how do you deal, how do you compete with that approach given their entrenched instrument capabilities and will your new platforms address that per procedure cost aspect of positioning you to better address some of these factors? Thanks so much.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I think the first thing of some of the messaging coming out around opportunities on price, on per procedure price, I think there's a big challenge for new entrants there, which is what benefit do you bring at which price point? So I think you're going to have to show benefit over laparoscopy, what can be done that lap can't do? And that's going to require some innovation and some technology, and that technology is going to have to be paid for. So I think over time, folks are going to have to come out and show what it is that they plan to do to make that happen. As we look at it, I do think there are opportunities for Intuitive to manage different price pints. We have already in terms of our capital line, and it's also true in our instrument line and we can continue to do that. So I think customers will have choice, and the choice will be at what price point do they want to enter and what benefit and value do they find at that price point. Intuitive will offer multiple price points. We will give them that opportunity. We have already and we will continue to. And what value they find at what price point will be their decision. And there's so far been really just one or two companies who have been out there having those conversations and driving it. I think we understand it reasonably well.
Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Appreciate the (54:51) perspective, Gary.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please.
Operator: One moment. And the next question is from the line of Tao Levy of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Your utilization per system in the U.S. keeps on hitting new highs. And so I'm just wondering, where is the increase in capacity that the hospitals are finding? Where is that coming from? Are they utilizing the workweek schedules a little bit more effectively versus in prior years?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Tao.
Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's more than one thing for me. One is we're seeing health systems, integrated delivery networks, optimizing the placement of their products and optimizing the flow of patients and surgeons around that product. And so that's kind of an operational efficiency at the hospital level or health system level that has been driving it, and I think it's great. It's been great for our customers and we support it. I think that the second thing is that some of the new procedure categories we're coming into allow for higher volume of procedures and sign up single sites, so more repeatable, shorter durations give you higher utilization, just kind of the nature of the mix of product that's coming in. And lastly, I think in some of the markets we're seeing referral consolidations. So low-volume surgeons are referring to higher-volume surgeons, essentially passing patients to those who do more, and that also drives up utilization. So there are kind of multiple factors there that have supported the growth. I don't know that it goes on forever. I don't think there's infinite growth in utilization possible, but so far, so good.
Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got you. And then just lastly, the percent of your applicable procedures that are currently using the robotic vessel sealer or stapler, do you have sort of a rough metric of where that stands today that you can share?
Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations: Yeah. Hey, Tao. Certainly, we have seen growth in our vessel sealer and stapler adoption each quarter over the past few years and particularly in procedures where there's a high value associated with using those, whether it be in colorectal resections, even in some gynecologic procedures with vessel sealers. There's still a lot of runway left. And in particular, as you think about the wide reloads that are only available on our Xi, and as the Xi installed base becomes larger, opening up more opportunities for those to be used in thoracic procedures, there's going to be plenty of runway ahead as the installed base continues to move towards our newest technology.
Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: You don't have like a procedure – I'm sorry, a percent that you can share just to get a sense of how long that runway is?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not at this time.
Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Operator, we'll take one more question from one more questioner and...
Operator: Okay. Thank you. Okay. And the next question is from the line of Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Rich S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just had a quick one, a follow-up on your Table Motion. It sounds like that product is certainly graining traction, and I was just curious to know, is this feature being used in the way that you would have expected it to? And what I'd really like to know is do you think, or can you tell us what procedures or new incremental procedures does this potentially open for you or could you begin to see it open up where you aren't already being used today? Thank you.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think that early experience has been that it's well received, particularly by multi-quadrant general surgeons, which is really where Xi was positioned and one of the big motivations for Table Motion. As frequently happens in this space, something that's a fundamental capability that's good in one place tends to have application in others, and I suspect we'll see that. And as we get more data on it, we're happy to share it with you.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That was our last question. As we said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flows during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. I thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months. Thank you.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. That concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q1 2016 Earnings Release Call. At this time, everyone joining is in a listen-only or muted mode, and later we will have a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. And I'll now turn the meeting over to our host, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Senior Director of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 2, 2016. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results, Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, and I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2016. And finally, we will host the question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. Our first quarter company performance was strong with excellent global procedure growth, solid capital placements, improving product margins and important new product launches. Turning first to procedures, global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 17%, led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States, continued growth in U.S. urology and modest growth in U.S. gynecology. Trends in U.S. general surgery growth continued with strong growth in inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair followed by continued growth in colorectal surgery. Customer feedback and commitment to the use of da Vinci in performing inguinal hernia repair for complex conditions has been encouraging in the quarter, increasing our confidence in its long-term acceptance. Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe, with solid performance in the United Kingdom and Germany offsetting slower growth in the Nordic countries. Performance in the quarter was helped by an extra procedure day in some regions relative to Q1 of 2015. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. We placed 110 da Vinci Systems in the quarter, up from 99 in Q1 of 2015. Customers continue to purchase our Xi Systems over less expensive and less capable Si models by a factor of approximately three to one. Capital performance was strong in United States, offsetting capital softness in Europe and the exploration of our quota in China. Lastly, customer leasing and lease to own arrangements are making up a greater percentage of new system placements. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call. Our operations teams remained focused on optimizing our manufacturing, design and supply chains for our newer products. Our teams continued to execute against their goals with steady improvements in reducing product costs for our new systems, advanced instruments in the quarter. Product cost reductions exceeded our expectations, and we expect them to continue to improve in 2016 and 2017. Our offerings make up an ecosystem designed to meet our customers' needs in building and running outstanding robotic surgery programs. This ecosystem includes systems and instruments and accessories, training technologies and peer-to-peer course work, service offerings, and program optimization and analytic support. As a result of the set of products and services that surround our systems, recurring revenue in the quarter comprised 75% of total company revenue. Highlights of the first quarter operating results are as follows. Procedures grew nearly 17% over the first quarter of last year. We shipped 110 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 99 in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $595 million, up 12% over the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 70% compared to 65.6% in the first quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $322 million, up 16%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $447 million, representing 75% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $229 million in the quarter, up 24% from the first quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $170 million, up 27% from Q1 of 2015. We continue to enable our Xi platform with new product launches. Our launch of intraoperative Table Motion is proceeding well with order flow that has met our expectations and with strong customer feedback on its utility, particularly in general surgery. In the quarter, we also launched our 30-millimeter Xi stapler designed to facilitate stapling in thoracic procedures and our Xi Single-Site instrument and accessory kit. Both are 30-millimeter stapler, and our Xi Single-Site instruments have started clinical use with positive feedback on their utility. Our Sp program remains on track. As our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in research and development. We have been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand our access to our technologies globally. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call. As we move forward in 2016, we're focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product into initial clinical use; third, driving our organizational capabilities end markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation, and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. First quarter revenue was $595 million, an increase of 12% compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 12% compared with the seasonally stronger fourth quarter of $677 million. First quarter 2016 procedures of approximately 176,000 increased nearly 17% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and decreased slightly compared with the fourth quarter procedures of approximately 177,000. Year-over-year procedure growth was driven by general surgery procedures in the U.S., in urology worldwide and otherwise likely benefited from an additional calendar day associated with leap year. Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of $322 million increased 16% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. These changes generally reflect changes in procedures. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial staffing orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure. This metric continues to fluctuate in a tight range from approximately $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the current quarter reflects higher sales of advanced instruments, offset by the impact of customer buying patterns and foreign exchange. System revenue of $148 million increased 5% compared with last year and decreased 36% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased revenue associated with operating lease activities and slightly higher average system selling prices. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter primarily reflects seasonally lower unit sales and slightly lower ASPs, partially offset by increased revenue associated with operating lease activities. 110 systems were placed in the first quarter compared with 99 systems in the first quarter of 2015 and 158 systems last quarter. Approximately 77% of the systems shipped in the quarter were Xi's, which is comparable to prior quarters. Hospitals financed approximately 37% of the systems placed in the first quarter, up from 17% last quarter. We directly financed 31 systems, including 19 operating leases. As of the end of the first quarter, there were 62 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $1 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $3 million in the fourth quarter. We also generated approximately $6 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $2 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and no lease buyout revenue in the first quarter of last year. We excluded the impact of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. Globally, our average system price of $1.500 million was approximately $30,000 higher than the first quarter of 2015 ASP and approximately $50,000 lower than the ASP last quarter. Relative to the prior year, the increase reflects a proportionately lower trade-in volume and favorable geographic mix, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter reflects proportionately higher trade-in volume and lower mix of Xi dual consoles, partially offset by favorable geographic mix. Service revenue of $125 million increased 9% year over year and increased approximately 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci Systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. First quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $164 million increased 9% compared with $150 million for the first quarter of 2015 and decreased 25% compared with a seasonally stronger fourth quarter of $219 million. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of a 14% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 22%, and increased systems revenue of 2%. The decrease compared to the fourth quarter reflects seasonally strong fourth quarter systems placements, partially offset by a 5% growth in recurring revenue. Outside the U.S., we placed 36 systems in the first quarter compared with 36 in the first quarter of 2015 and 75 last quarter. Current quarter system sales included five into China and eight into Japan. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy, as some of these markets are in their early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, the pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was 70% compared with 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015 and 69.6% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Compared with the first quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects reduction of product and product repair costs, improved manufacturing operations efficiencies, the elimination of the medical device tax, lower costs associated with product field actions and related inventory charges, and a higher mix of instrument and accessory revenue. The medical device tax has been suspended for the next two years and reduced our 2015 gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, our ability to further reduce product costs, manufacturing efficiency, costs associated with product field actions, and in the long-term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude legal settlements and accruals for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP increased 14% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and increased 5% compared with last quarter. The increases over prior periods reflect increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics, increased head count, and higher payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 28.9% for the first quarter of 2015 and 24.9% last quarter. In late December 2015, Congress retroactively approved the 2015 federal research and development credit and made the R&D tax credit permanent going forward. The entire 2015 R&D tax credit was included in the fourth quarter, while no benefit was reflected in the first quarter of 2015 and a proportional benefit is reflected in the first quarter of 2016. Other than the impact of the R&D credit, fluctuations in our tax rate between this quarter and the first and fourth quarters of 2015 primarily reflect changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income. Our first quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $170 million or $4.42 per share compared with $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and $224 million or $5.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. Note that fully diluted shares outstanding increased by approximately 400,000 shares relative to the fourth quarter resulting primarily from the increase in our share price. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $595 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and $677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. We ended the year with cash and investments of $3.8 billion, up from $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by proceeds from stock option exercises and cash generated from operations. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan - Finance Director: Thanks, Marshall. Of our first quarter procedure growth of nearly 17%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 15% and OUS procedures grew approximately 22%. In the U.S., even though growth benefited from favorable operating days in the quarter, procedure growth outpaced our expectations. First quarter growth in our mature procedures continued at levels similar to the second half of 2015 generating majority of the procedure outperformance relative to our expectation. General surgery procedure growth also exceeded our expectations. In U.S. urology, first quarter growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy and kidney procedures continued at similar rates at the second half of 2015. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, and we expect the prostatectomy group to return to levels similar to prostate cancer incident rates over time. In U.S. gynecology, first quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, with growth led by malignant and complex hysterectomy. Continuing the trend from 2015, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, U.S. Single-Site gynecology procedure growth declined compared to the first quarter of 2015. First quarter growth in U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remains strong, led by a robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Cholecystectomy procedures were roughly flat in the quarter, with growth in multi-port procedures offsetting declines in Single-Site procedures. Q1 was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci Surgery. Of these, I have selected a couple studies that you may find interesting. With the launch of our 30-millimeter stapler, surgeon interest in the use of da Vinci for thoracic surgery is growing. A new study comparing open video-assisted thoracic surgery, or VATS, and da Vinci Surgery for pulmonary lobectomy was published by Dr. Yang and colleagues from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Annals of Surgery. Using a prospective database including 2,400 surgeries to treat stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer patients, the officers' propensity matched 470 patients across da Vinci, VATS and open surgery. The study found that da Vinci and minimally invasive VATS approaches enabled a shorter chest tube duration and length of hospital stay compared to open surgery. Da Vinci Surgery was also credited with improved lymph node yields as compared to both open surgery and VATS, an important clinical outcome for determining next steps in the patient's treatment pathway. As related to the expansion of da Vinci lung resections, the authors highlighted that nearly 57% of pulmonary lobectomies in the U.S. are treated with open surgery, and they see promise in expanding patient access to minimally invasive surgery through da Vinci technology. Turning abroad, procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 22% in the first quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resection. Compared to the second half of 2015, procedure growth slowed in both Europe and Asia during the quarter, in part due to the timing of the Easter holiday. Historically, our OUS procedure growth rates have been lumpy and less predictable in the short-term. We are focused on improving our OUS procedure performance. In Japan, there were positive developments relating to reimbursement in the quarter. The MHLW approved for reimbursement of partial nephrectomy at a premium rate relative to open surgery and also approved clinical trial enrollment to begin supporting a sensionary OB (20:42) submission for da Vinci malignant hysterectomy. A recent study funded by Intuitive and published in BJU International by Professor Hughes and colleagues from University of Chester collected data from the United Kingdom health episode statistics database, including more than 20,000 prostatectomy patients and 2,000 partial nephrectomy patients, to assess health resource utilization and cost, following da Vinci, open and laparoscopic procedures. The database showed that from 2008 to 2013, the use of da Vinci Surgery increased from 15% to 50% of prostatectomies and 1% to 22% of partial nephrectomies by displacing open surgery. During the first year after the operation, da Vinci Surgery was shown to reduce inpatient admission, hospital bed days and total costs for both prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy compared to open surgery. At three years, post operation, the study showed similar outcomes for prostatectomy and was insufficient to draw conclusions for partial nephrectomy. Laparoscopic surgery outcomes were at the approximate midpoint between da Vinci and open surgery on resource utilization and costs for both procedures. The authors concluded "our analysis suggests that there are substantial savings associated with robotic-assisted surgery when compared with open and laparoscopic interventions." This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling - Senior Director-Finance, Investor Relations: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. Starting with procedures, on our last call, we estimated full-year 2016 procedure growth of 9% to 12% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now, based upon favorable U.S. dVP and gynecology macro trends, and U.S. general surgery growth, we are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full-year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 14%. Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 68% and 69.5% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full-year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue. Turning to operating expenses. As we have described, we will be increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. On our last call, we forecast to grow pro forma 2016 operating expenses between 9% and 13% above 2015 levels. We are now increasing our estimate for operating expenses to a range of between 12% and 15% above 2015. Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect our 2016 other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to be in the upper end of the $20 million to $25 million range forecast on our last call. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pre-tax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and OUS profits. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: We have a question from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. Two questions. But first of all, congrats on the great momentum in the business. I have a question on U.S. procedure volume growth and then on your comments on OpEx spend. First, on procedure volume growth, one, can you give us a sense of what you think you grew in the quarter on a same day selling basis? But then much more importantly, just give us a sense as to specifically which surgery types accelerated in the U.S. And what drove the growth? What caused the acceleration? Why did things get better?
Patrick Clingan - Finance Director: Hey, Bob, thanks for the question. From a same day selling perspective, estimating the impact of operating days is anything but an exact science. From a tailwind at leap year, that benefited the quarter and some modest benefit from the timing of new year's being on a Friday rather than a Thursday. And from a headwind perspective, you had the timing of Easter which moved from the second quarter into the first quarter. But that has more of an impact on the OUS geographies. From what accelerated, the mature procedures sustained pretty strong growth in the quarter, as they saw throughout 2015, which was a little bit of a surprise to us relative to our initial expectations. And general surgery continues to be strong and growing off of a larger base which has more impact on the U.S. procedure growth number.
Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then, well, for the follow-up, I wanted to ask Gary a question on OpEx spend because I think it's an important comment from you guys. Your spending in the quarter was high exactly as you said it would be. And now, you're raising that spend level even further. So can you just talk about where the incremental spend is going. What kind of new incremental technology announcements could that lead to? You mentioned a couple on the call, but I'm just really curious as to where the spending is going and when we could expect to get more visibility on the output from that spending.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So on the spend, I think the acceleration is really borne of confidence, confidence in the long-term viability of some of the markets and some of the things we're pursuing. You'll see it really cut into a couple of buckets. Some of it is investments in OUS markets where we think that we can do more by investing more, and we've been talking to you about that. The other side is on R&D. And in terms of categories, we've talked about it before, but we believe in them deeply: advanced imagining, the ability to see beyond what you can just see with your naked eye; new robotic architectures that allow surgeons to get into and out of the body in different ways and to different places than they could reach prior; as well as analytics and over-the-shoulder guidance, all things that we have been investing in, some things that we're accelerating. So we won't do product announcements on this call. As we get deeper into those things and are ready to share them more broadly with you, of course we will.
Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then lastly, just to get a sense, I thought I heard something about positive hysterectomy in Japan. It went by pretty quickly. Is there some positive momentum on hysterectomy in Japan from a reimbursement perspective?
Patrick Clingan - Finance Director: Yeah, Bob, the MHLW approved for a clinical trial to begin enrollment supporting malignant hysterectomy under the sensionary OB (28:17) process.
Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, it's been requested if you can limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, and we'll take additional questions as time permits. Our next question from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thanks. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about Table Motion, how many systems are installed that are capable, what percentage of systems I guess have the option included, and if you could just talk a little bit about how it flows through to gross margins as well. It's mainly a software upgrade from your perspective, right?
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, we're pretty pleased with the level of adoption for Table Motion, where the information we're getting back from surgeons is they're pleased with its usage and its performance. We're not going to be disclosing every quarter just how many tables we've delivered, so I won't go there. I'll just tell you that, again, we're pretty pleased with the level of adoption.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Obviously, the revenue and the margin side.
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, the margins – so what we're providing is a software update to the Xi that enables the Table Motion. The table itself is being purchased from Trumpf.
Unknown Speaker: (29:37).
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: (29:39). And so, our billing is 100% margin.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And I guess maybe what I was getting at is the degree to which this is going to drive a bolus of demand for Xi now that you have that, plus the full instrument set. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about how you see that flowing through to Xi demand?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think that it – each one of these steps, the 30-millimeter Xi stapler, the integrated Table Motion now, the Xi instrument kit is rounding out that Xi platform. And we have some more to do. It's not all complete, but it's definitely becoming a much fuller and richer ecosystem. We think that helps. It's very hard to forecast how much it is, how many people sit and wait until the next step, but we think those things add clinical value. For sure, a 30 millimeter stapler in thoracic procedures is a big win, likewise Table Motion for a lot of the more complex procedures. So we think that's strong. And there are a group of hospitals that use Si with Single-Site that if they're a single system hospital, they only own just one and they have a robust Single-Site program. This allows them to consider Xi as an upgrade. So it's hard to quantify, but we think directionally it's really strong.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then a follow-up. Can you just comment on Europe? It looked like that was a little soft. Maybe just talk about the outlook there for the year.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Europe was definitely variable, both in procedures and in systems. On the procedure side, we had some strength in some countries where they're moving along, and we think there's opportunity to do that and better. There are some other countries where it's going a little slower. Sometimes, it's a local economy issue. Sometimes, it's more where we are in maturity. In some of these countries, we're pretty well adopted in the mature procedures and they're really at the beginnings of emerging procedures. So it depends country-by-country. On the capital side, I think there's two things going on. A little bit of environment is one, and a little bit of wait-and-see on competitive offerings as they come out, and we're navigating that pretty well. In terms of head-to-head comparisons with our technology, our systems are coming out great. But it can put a delay in the pipeline, and we're seeing a little bit of that in Europe.
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: The only other thing I'd add is that Europe has become very seasonal. And so if you look at Q4, it was extremely strong relative to the previous couple of quarters, and Q1 is more comparable to the previous year Q1.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Just two quick ones here. Marshall, just coming back to gross margin guidance, so GMs have been stronger for five consecutive quarters, and the guidance sort of implies no improvement throughout the year which seems, I guess, less likely to us, just given the cost improvements you've already discussed. So can we just talk through gross margin progression throughout the balance of the year and why you think 70% here in the first quarter is the high water mark?
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. So one of the biggest factors we see going forward is product mix. So know that we have higher margins on instruments and accessories than we do on systems. And Q1 tends to be seasonally a lower quarter for capital. And also, we see growth in the new product, particularly energy product, stapling and vessel sealing going forward. And those also have lower margins than the base. So I think just based on product mix alone, we don't expect to sustain 70%.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then Gary, obviously, people have asked about spending already. And I note that the R&D spend is the highest we've seen in four years. So you're obviously clearly going to continue to invest. I've no expectations you're going to talk to us about future instrumentation and system announcements, but I think the enigma for most shareholders actually is advanced imaging, because that's sort of more future looking. Is there any chance we get incremental updates or at least even any update on the strategy for advanced imaging this year? Thank you.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's a fair question. In general, we have been making early investments in advanced imaging. And what I'd tell you there is it's not one thing. As you know, we have Firefly which is a molecular imaging based product. We also have invested in raw imaging hardware capabilities which we'll continue to do. What we like to do is, as we have milestones that make sense, whether it's talking to regulatory bodies or engaging in clinical work, those tend to be good anchors to discuss with you. And as those arrive, then we'll share with you what we're thinking.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And could those arrive potentially in 2016 for advanced imaging or unlikely?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think when we get there, we'll let you know.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, sir. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. I wanted, Gary, just to come back to some of the early part of your prepared remarks where you discussed the continued momentum that you're seeing in hernia. And it seemed like at stages this year, there was sort of a positive, I would say, tipping point but just incremental enthusiasm from the position community around this procedure. Can you maybe sort of talk about what you think specifically is stimulating that demand and why you're confident in that continuing on a go-forward basis?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's two ways that our confidence has been building. One of them is around the clinical outcomes and anecdotes that we hear. And that comes to, as we've talked about before, inguinal hernia particularly is a segmented market. Not all patients are suffering the same level of disease and in the more complex cases, if it's bilateral or prior abdominal surgery, obese patients, a large herniated sac. The raw clinical capability of our products is being touted as and supported by surgeons as being important to them, a better quality of intervention, consumable costs in line with what their expectations are. So there, I think that we're feeling pretty good. The second thing we can do is analyze kind of the reorder rates from surgeons as they go forward. So as you get through the trial periods, seeing kind of where as they learn it and get deeper and deeper into it, where do they apply it and how often do they keep buying our products. And that has been supportive as well. So as those two things come together, we start feeling better about it. And that's what's behind that set of comments.
David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. Thank you. Then just for my follow-up on the operating lease side, it looks like this is sort of a higher quarter for percentage of total coming from operating leases. So I guess, A, can you just talk sort of through some of the dynamics underpinning that? And then, B, based on your disclosures, it looks like people are buying out these operating leases relatively quickly. Maybe help us understand is that true and why that's the case.
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. So, the operating leases is our way of being able to be flexible with the customer and meet the customers' needs in terms of financing. Some of the leases are shorter term and basically bridge their ability to get to a capital approval process, and those are a couple of the ones you've seen bought out in this quarter. Most of the operating leases are longer term being four- and five-year terms. And we'll drive a recurring revenue going forward. Like we said, this quarter was around $4 million.
David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Gary, a question on the ecosystem. One of the most material competitive advantages you guys have is kind of the embedding of the technology and your training and all the other things throughout the healthcare system. What investments can you guys make? And are you planning to make it different than what you've done before to try to lever that because you did specifically call that out?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thinking a great robotic surgery program is really the integration of all of those things, and there are multiyear efforts to build that set of programs from peer-to-peer networks that do advanced course work and teaching to validated learning pathways and simulation. Those validations are multiyear efforts to get right to the full instrument kit from vessel sealing to stapling and so on. And so, we're pretty thoughtful about balancing that set of investments. The thing that has gotten really stronger and interesting in the last couple of years have been our ability to analyze data, look at national benchmarking, look at regional-based benchmarking, and share that information with our customers so that they can make good decisions. Sometimes, those decisions are good for them and not great for Intuitive in the near term. If they optimize their program, we may get revenue per procedure in the near term. But we think long term, it's better for everybody. And so, we've been making those analytics in those investments and then communicating with hospitals. So we really have been plugging in in each of those settings. And I do think it makes for an ecosystem that creates a lot of value for the customer and builds our relationship with them.
Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. And Patrick, a quick one for you. Can we think about the extra selling day as maybe 1.5 percentage points of procedure growth? I know there's some offsets with Easter, et cetera. But is it in that range of what the bump was net?
Patrick Clingan - Finance Director: Yeah, Ben, I'll let you kind of do your math on the specific percentage. But as it relates to the benefit, it really is just think of it more as in the U.S. because the favorability of leap year and new year gets mostly washed out by Easter, particularly in Europe.
Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, Gary. Good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to talk a little bit more about U.S. urology and U.S. gynecology. I was really intrigued with the modest growth on the gynecology side. I mean that's a significant turnaround from the headwind you faced over the last couple of years; also urology acting better. Have we worked through some of the challenges in each? And are we actually going to return to more sustainable growth in U.S. gynecology after a year or more or two of training and education, et cetera?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me speak to a couple other factors, and then I'll let Patrick take it from there. As we look at urology, you've got it right, three main procedures in urology: prostatectomy, partial nephrectomy and cystectomy; the biggest one being prostatectomy. We know there was a bolus of patients that went into watchful waiting, some of whom will have disease progression and come back to definitive treatment. How long that bolus lasts is a little bit hard for us to predict. The second thing are the possibility of share changes between some of the treatment modalities, surgery versus radiation, versus watchful waiting. That data tends to lag. It's hard to get it in real-time. There may be some share change, although if there is, it's probably modest. And then there's just demographics. As demographics changes, you have more folks getting diagnosed with prostate cancer over time. So those are the three things that are rolling through, and sort of projecting how they balance out is what the challenge is. On the gynecology side, the thing that we're seeing in our experience is that you're seeing more surgery being done by high volume gynecologists in general, not just robotic surgery but laparoscopy and others. We're seeing a consolidation in the marketplace into folks who are either GY (41:53) oncologists or more routine surgeons. We think that's good for the world, and we think that's good for Intuitive. Those more dedicated surgeons tend to be our customers. We see them tackling more procedures in concentrated fashions, and so that's kind of what's happening in gynecology. Likewise, I think there's a demographic element here that's likely to find the bottom and then start to drift up. The unknown is nonsurgical approaches and in-office approaches. Those are kind of the factors at play. Patrick, I'll let you go from there.
Patrick Clingan - Finance Director: Yeah. No, I think you described the urology situation well. The other thing to bear in mind in the GYN market is while Single-Site procedures have been declining, some of the other benign procedures have been stabilizing and are creating less of a headwind to us on a year-over-year comparison basis, things like myomectomy.
Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And I guess my follow-up question, and it might have been you, Patrick, who mentioned it, I think somebody described OUS procedure growth as it can be lumpy and "we're working to improve the performance there." Can you talk a little about how you're going about that? What kind of initiatives are underway? And what you would hope or we should expect might come from those initiatives? Thank you.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll take that one, Rick. The opportunity in Europe tends to be country by country. So, where we're looking to do something different or better, it tends to be making sure that we have staff that is supporting local efforts and local needs that they're working in local language, that they understand the healthcare systems in intimate ways that are specific to that country. And so where we see opportunity, we'll invest there and build that out; we have been. Where we've made investments, we've seen growth. And so, where we see some areas of opportunity, we think we have a playbook. Now, we have to go execute against that playbook. That's been our perspective there.
Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I was hoping to start on the general surgery side. And it sounds like again very good quarter, but I'm just curious if either of the various ventral – or I'm sorry, the various hernia cases are really leading the charge in some of that growth. Are you seeing any kind of divergence or inflection in either ventral or inguinal? And are those procedures at this point getting sizable enough to start to sway hospital decision making as to adding additional systems in order to meet that demand?
Patrick Clingan - Finance Director: Hey, Matt. Thanks for the question. Certainly, both ventral and inguinal hernia procedures continue to exhibit robust growth. Inguinal hernia is just a bigger overall procedure category. It's just more commonly performed. But the rates of adoption that we're seeing in both procedures is encouraging, and the surgeon populations that are performing them are continuing to increase the volumes of procedures that they're doing. So it looks promising. And certainly, from an overall volume perspective, it had some influence because just the numbers are getting to the point where it matters to create access for these surgeons to be able to continue to perform procedures that they are absorbing systems worth of activity at some of their institutions.
Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. That's very helpful. And then, Gary, your commentary about the delays that we saw in Europe as hospitals are evaluating some competitive systems that are hitting those markets is curious to me. Do you think that's something that will linger here throughout 2016 as those systems are fully rolled out? Or do you think it'll be a fairly quick process of kind of taking a peak, and maybe they're doing that now and we could see a snap-back in terms of the number of systems placed? I mean specifically, did you see 10, 15 hospitals kind of delay as they were evaluating both systems, and then out of those 10 hospitals, 9 of them ended up buying da Vinci either late last quarter or even early his quarter?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think that it's a little bit hard to predict how fast it will go through. I guess our anecdotal experience has been, some have been quick looks, and make an evaluation and come sign up with us, and others are going through a little bit longer process. So with regard to a "snap-back," I wouldn't bake that in. I think it will play out a little longer than that. Having said that, the response of our customers after they have evaluated the other offerings and come back to talk to us has been fantastic. So our confidence that we have good offerings and we can meet these customers' needs is very high. They'll go through that process. And I think as new and different technologies come to market, not just the ones that are there today, I think this will be part of the new normal a little bit for Europe, is people cross shopping and making decisions. And our goal is to make sure that they find our products to be a very high value. So far, so good.
Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from Larry Keusch, Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. I wondered if we could just, first question, start with the trade-ins. I think there were 42 as you mentioned this quarter, and I think the prior quarters it's been sort of averaging closer to 30. So I'm just trying to understand perhaps what is driving the higher trade-in. And then what's the ultimate opportunity to drive trade-ins in your older system base?
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: There's nothing specific about this quarter that I would call out as it relates to trade-ins. I think you have the numbers right. It came off of our – the detail we provided with the press release. I wouldn't call anything out specifically. I think last quarter, it was around – in the high 30s, and it's been there for a little while. I don't know that – it'll probably fluctuate in that range. So I don't have any specific comments on it.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then for Gary, maybe just an update on SB (48:01). You mentioned some in your prepared comments. But where are we in getting those evaluations going? And is it conceivable that we could see commercial units perhaps by the end of the year?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we are in discussions with FDA on a trial type and end points, and we have clinical sites that are getting prepped; the product from the engineering and design and validation point of view is right on track. It looks really good. We're not expecting anything of substance in terms of revenue this year. We do expect them in clinical use in the second half, and that's what we're working towards.
Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Congrats on a great quarter. My first question has to do with just trying to understand better your dogma as it relates to managing the P&L. So what obviously we're getting here is higher procedural volume guidance and higher operating expense guidance. What we seem to be seeing is some leverage to the operating line. But I'm just curious, Gary, if you could talk about – Marshall, talk about your dogma over the next couple of years. And sort of are you looking for operating margin expansion? Is that what your objective is? Are you managing the business to top-line growth and trying to manage expenses the best you can to get there? Could you just talk about your dogma as it relates to managing the P&L?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So my first statement is kind of a caution of, beware of averages. So there are places in the business where we're seeking high operational efficiency and leverage. You see that in product cost reductions and some of the things we're doing in manufacturing. There are other places in the operation where we think we can find leverage. At the same time, we want to turn around and reinvest those savings in opportunity. And we see a lot of opportunity. And I think that that opportunity should be pursued. So it'll be a little bit lumpy. We're trying to be balanced. I wouldn't say that our approach is hard over one or hard over the other. It's not revenue above all else, and it's not profit above all else. We're trying to be balanced in that approach. And it may be a little bit lumpy. I think opportunities happen when they happen. You can be overly cautious and miss them, and so we'll maintain a fiscal discipline. That's been part of our history and we'll keep it. Having said that, we want to make sure that we reinvest some of the benefits that the company has gained into expanding the opportunity we see in front of us.
Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: That's helpful. My second and final question, having to do with your cash balance and use of cash, you've been very proficient at buying back stock in the past. Given where the share price is juxtaposed to a significantly expanding cash balance, would it be fair to assume that you'll do maybe modest to moderate share repurchases going forward? Or will we see maybe less over the next two years than we saw in the last two years? Thanks.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In terms of just how we think about capital allocation, we are thoughtful and serious about it, as you'd expect. We think buybacks are one leg or one tool in capital allocation. We really start with, can we reinvest in the business and drive long-term growth and opportunity, buybacks if – there are times we've been typically patient and opportunistic. And we think because of the volatility of our stock, there are times that that makes a lot of sense for us. And in conversations with shareholders, where we are thoughtful and listen, then we have considered dividends, and we will consider them in the future. So, we look at those three things and try to trade them off. And we think for the long term; when we're thinking about capital allocation, we're not trying to do signaling or messaging. We're trying to build value for the business and for the shareholders in the long term.
Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thank you, guys.
Operator: And we have a question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe one on the OUS placements. I know China, I think on the last quarter, you said they had about eight systems. Can we expect sort of renewed, I guess, a contract from the government, right (52:46)? How should we think about OUS from a systems perspective given that China, they're probably at the end of the amount of systems that they can import?
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. So, I'll speak to China first and then to other locations next. As far as China goes, when we left last quarter, there were about six systems left on the quota. We sold five this quarter. There's still one out there. I don't know if it'll happen. And we're going to have to go through a tender process, and that tender process had to have already begun. As far as additional quotas, it's a part of the overall budget, government budget process in China. And so when that gets completed – and I don't have a magic ball that tells me when it will be completed – then we'll know whether we're still under the quota system and we'll know, if we are under the quota system, how many will be awarded. And there's no way to predict that in advance. As far as the rest of the world goes, in my remarks, I mentioned that the fourth quarter is a seasonally strong quarter. If you look at where we came out for this quarter, it was pretty comparable to last year for the first quarter. But it's going to be lumpy market-by-market depending on the circumstances.
Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI: Great. And then maybe one follow-up for Gary. I know that clinical trial – I mean R&D expenses were up 25% in the Q. Does that number include any clinical trial expenses, because I'm just trying to get a sense for – and as you talked about Japan, starting clinical trials, sort of any potential impact on that number?
Marshall L. Mohr - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. There's some – we've said before, we're in the middle of gathering data or evidence for gastrectomy in Japan. That doesn't go into R&D. That's actually in our SG&A numbers. And if we were doing – I mean, as far as other clinical trials, we'll tell you about them when we think it's appropriate.
Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI: Thanks, guys. Congrats on a strong quarter.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. Good afternoon.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Tao.
Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: So, we've talked a lot about the sort of hernia colorectal surgery, but you mentioned a couple times thoracic surgery and the benefit that, particularly, the Xi might bring to that procedure. Can you sort of maybe summarize some of the key opportunities within thoracic? Should we think of it as colorectal type opportunity where it's moving in the right direction, but it's a little bit slower? Or could it potentially be more like a hernia or hysterectomy opportunity?
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Just I'll start, and I'll ask Patrick to join in. Just from the starting place, these are typically cancer procedures and typically complex, mediastinal cancers, lung cancers. The product set that we have, Xi moves us in the right direction. Some of the instrumentation we're bringing along moves us in the right direction in terms of providing surgeons with the tools they are looking for for efficient procedures. And I think we're at the beginnings of that. The way to think about the market is there are some minimally invasive surgery done manually, video-assisted thoracic surgery. Some institutions do a lot of it with good results. Others do very little of it. If you look at national averages rather than institutional numbers, you see a lot of open surgery done, and we think that that's the opportunity. I'll let Patrick characterize it sort of.
Patrick Clingan - Finance Director: Yeah, Tao. It's still pretty early days. We're in the foundation. We've got a small team in the U.S. focused on it, but our focus continues to be on driving general surgery growth and hernia and colorectal resections. And internationally, we're still highly focused on driving dVP adoption and some emerging procedures in countries where urology is deeply penetrated. And when you look around internationally, it is a cancer that is very common in Asia and other parts. So it's very big opportunity for us, so perhaps a little bit around the corner from what we're currently focused on.
Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And as my follow-up, you mentioned focusing on urology internationally. And I understand that it's still relatively under penetrated, but it is just the same procedure that you keep on going after internationally. Should we be worried that some of the other procedures that are catching on here in the U.S. over the last few years aren't moving the needle yet internationally? Thanks.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tao. That'll be our last question. I'll answer that, and then we'll move on. I think it depends by country. So we see, for example, nice adoption of thoracic surgery in China. We see a pretty different mix of procedures in Korea than we see in the United States. So you have to answer it country-by-country. I don't think there's a systemic worry here that somehow we're stuck at prostatectomy and won't be able to move any further. I do think that it's important for folks on the phone to realize that the profile of procedures at each country is going to differ based on disease state, based on how the reimbursement system works and the relative priorities of their healthcare system. So we see that reflected. We do see multiple procedure adoptions in different countries. It just differs on what they're after.
Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tao.
Gary S. Guthart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That was our last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flows during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and I look forward to speaking with you again in three months.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service, and you may now disconnect.

Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO, Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer and Patrick Clingan, Senior Director of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 5, 2015 and 10-Q, filed on October 21, 2015. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com, on the Audio Archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with our highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results, Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, then I will provide our financial outlook for 2016 and finally we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. 2015 was a good year for Intuitive with increased use of our products around the globe and solid operational execution. Our focus in 2015 was to drive adoption of our platform in general surgery, expand our da Vinci Xi Surgical System product line, increase our organizational capability and performance in international markets and improve contribution margins for our newly launched products. Themes that emerged at the close of 2014 continued into 2015 with strong performance in general surgery and international procedure growth. Full-year global procedure growth was approximately 14%, led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci surgical systems outside the United States and strength in urology. U.S. general surgery growth was approximately 31% for the year made up of strong growth in inguinal hernia repair, ventral hernia repair and colorectal surgery, use of single site in cholecystectomy and hysterectomy declined for the year. Outside of the United States, procedure growth was strong, rising approximately 26% over procedures in 2014. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. Looking at trends in capital sales for the year, capital placements increased in 2015 to 492 from 431 placements in 2014. Customer interest and acceptance of our latest platform da Vinci Xi has been positive with Xi making up the majority of placements for the year. In 2015, we shipped 298 systems in the United States, 90 in Europe, 77 in Asia and 27 in other global markets. Our operations teams remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing, design and supply chains for our newer products. Progress in the back half of 2015 has been solid with steady improvements in reducing product costs for our new systems and advanced instruments. We expect our product cost to continue to improve in 2016 and 2017 as a result of these efforts. As we have said before, our offerings make up an ecosystem designed to encompass our customers' needs in building and running outstanding robotic surgery programs. 2015 was a year which we focused on enabling our ecosystem with new product launches globally. We launched our da Vinci Xi system with a core set of instruments, vessel sealer and Firefly Fluorescence Imaging in 2014. We broadened access to our Xi system with international regulatory clearances through the year. We also added our 45 millimeter Xi stapler in Q1 as well as Harmonic Curved Shears and a second set of instruments in Q2 of 2015. We submitted our 510(k) for our 30 millimeter stapler for Xi, single site instrument kit for Xi as well as other Xi accessories in the second half of 2015. I am pleased to report that we obtained FDA clearance for integrated Xi table motion this month. In addition to products, our surgeon customers can choose from dozens of training courses provided by academic surgeons as well as courses designed for assistance and other operating room staff. Our customers own over 1,400 surgical simulators and over 600 dual consoles to assist them in technology training. In addition, our teams have provided detailed analytic and operational support for customers seeking to optimize and benchmark their programs relative to international norms. We believe the combination of these products and services are important to fully enable our customers. Looking back at the full year of 2015, our operating performance is summarized as follows. Worldwide procedures grew by approximately 14%. We shipped 492 da Vinci surgical systems in the year, up from 431 in 2014. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 12% from 2014 and up 15% on a constant currency basis. Recurring revenue grew to $1.7 billion, up 11% and comprising 70% of total revenue. We generated $946 million in pro forma operating profit, up 16% from last year. Pro forma net income was $731 million, up 20% from 2014 and we repurchased 366,000 shares at an average price of $502 per share during 2015. Turning to our operating performance for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the fourth quarter of last year. We shipped 158 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 137 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $677 million, up 13% from prior year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $326 million, up 16%. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $293 million in the quarter, up 28% from the fourth quarter of last year and pro forma net income was $224 million, up 22% from Q4 of 2014. As we look to the future, we passionately believe that robotic assisted surgery is in its infancy in application and technology. As we have improved our cost and supply chains for new products, we anticipate increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic assisted surgery. These include product investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next generation robotics. We will also continue to invest in procedure, product and program analytics, international market development and economic and clinical validation. Looking to 2016, our priorities are as follows. First, we will focus on the expanded use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair. Second, we will work to advance our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product line into initial clinical use. Third, we will drive our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia. And finally, we will continue to assist our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. I will now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal settlements and legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion. Pro forma fourth quarter revenue was $677 million, an increase of 13% compared with $601 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and an increased to 15% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 excludes $4 million of revenue associated with offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for Xi product. All trade out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 procedures of approximately 177,000 increased 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 9% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Procedure growth was primarily driven by general surgery procedures in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased 16% compared with last year. It increased 9% compared with the third quarter of 2015. The increase relative to prior year reflects procedure growth and increased sales of advanced instruments, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase over the prior quarter reflects procedure growth and sales of advanced instruments, partially offset by customer buying patterns. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure. This metric has now been trending in a tight range between $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure over the past year with recent quarters reflecting higher sales of advanced instruments offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Pro forma system revenue of $231 million increased 9% compared with last year and increased 32% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased unit sales. The increase relative to the third quarter reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by lower ASPs. 158 systems replaced in the fourth quarter compared with 137 systems in the fourth quarter 2014 and 117 systems last quarter. Approximately 72% of the systems shipped in the quarter were Xi which is comparable to prior quarter. Globally, our average systems price of $1,550,000 is comparable to the fourth quarter 2014, slightly less than $1,600,000 ASP last quarter. Relative to the prior year, increases related to the lower trade-in mix were mostly offset by foreign exchange. The decrease relative to the third quarter reflects geographic mix and a lower proportion of Xi dual consoles. ASPs fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on geographic and product mix, trade-in volume and changes in foreign exchange rates. Hospitals financed approximately 17% of the systems placed in the fourth quarter, down from 25% last quarter. We directly financed 20 systems, including placing the most operating leases, 16, since we began our direct leasing program in the second quarter 2014. As of the end of the fourth quarter, 49 of the 3,597 systems out in the field were under operating leases. We exclude the impact of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. Service revenue of $120 million increased 9% year-over-year and increased 2% compared with the third quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect the increase in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of U.S. results were as follows. Fourth quarter pro forma revenue outside of the U.S. of $219 million increased 11% compared with $198 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 45% compared with $151 million last quarter. The increase compared with the previous year reflects higher system unit sales and higher recurring revenue driven by procedure growth of 27%. Outside the U.S., we placed 75 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 66 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 37 systems last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 13 into China, 11 in Japan, eight into Italy and seven into Brazil. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales in to some markets are constrained by government regulations. The pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 69.6% compared with 67.1% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, the higher gross margin reflects lower inventory charges, improved efficiencies, partially offset by foreign exchange and a higher mix of our newer products, which carry lower gross margins than our mature products. Gross margin includes the impact of the medical device tax which has been suspended for the next two years. The medical device tax reduced our 2015 gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, on whether we are required to pay the medical device tax and costs associated with manufacturing efficiencies and product charges. In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product legal liability claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $14 million in the first half of the year. There were no charges in the second half of 2015. Charges made related to this agreement are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. As of the end of the fourth quarter, $24 million remained accrued on our balance sheet as a significant portion of the estimated cost have been paid. Pro forma operating expenses which exclude reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 6% compared with last quarter. Year-over-year increase in pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. The increase relative to the third quarter primarily reflects increased incentive compensation. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24.9% compared with an effective tax rate of 23.5% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 18.4% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 included tax benefits of $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a recent favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party. In late December, Congress renewed the federal research and development credit, resulting in a benefit of $6 million or $0.17 per share. Congress also made the R&D tax credit permanent, so our 2016 rate guidance will reflect this benefit. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and oUS income. Our fourth quarter 2015 pro forma net income was $224 million or $5.89 per share, compared with $184 million or $4.92 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter 2015. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $605 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $590 million for the third quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $147 million or $3.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015. We ended the year with cash and investments of $3.3 billion, up from $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 167,000 shares for $84 million at an average price of $505 per share. This brings our total stock repurchases for 2015 to approximately $184 million. With that, I would like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan: Thanks, Marshall. So the fourth quarter year-over-year procedures grew approximately 15% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12% and international procedures growing approximately 27%. Full year 2015 procedure growth was approximately 14% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 11% and international procedures growing approximately 26%. In the U.S., fourth quarter procedure growth of approximately 12% was driven by continued strength in general surgery procedures with solid contribution coming from mature procedures despite already high levels of market penetration. We do not expect the strong 2015 growth in established U.S. urology and gynecology procedures to continue in 2016. In U.S. urology, fourth quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at similar rates as earlier in the year. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. In 2015, procedure growth in U.S. urology was approximately 12%, led by an approximate 11% growth in da Vinci prostatectomy. We expect U.S. da Vinci prostatectomy procedure volumes to return to a level more in-line with prostate cancer incidence rate going forward. In U.S. gynecology, fourth quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy partially offset by declines in benign procedures. During 2015, a larger proportion of da Vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists compared to 2014. For the year, growth in U.S. gynecology procedures was approximately 1%. In 2016, sustaining growth in U.S. gynecology maybe a challenge as we believe the total market for benign hysterectomies will continue to decline at a low single-digit rate. Fourth quarter growth in U.S. general surgery remains strong with robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures, being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. U.S. general surgery procedure growth was approximately 31% for the year with broad-based growth across several procedures, led by hernia repair, which generated the largest number of new general surgery procedures. Growth in colorectal resections was also stronger in 2015. In 2016, there remains a large opportunity in hernia repair and colorectal resections and driving adoption these markets remains among our top priorities. During the quarter a group of general surgeons, led by Dr. Vorst from St. Joseph Mercy Health System and Dr. Carbonell from the University of South Carolina School of Medicine published their perspective on advances in ventral and incisional hernia repair in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery. Within the paper, data comparing the robotic to open Rives-Stoppa technique for more complex hernias favored the robotic approach with the reduction in blood loss, shorter length of hospital stay, fewer surgical site infections and no difference in operative times or direct costs. The paper states that robotic approach "permits relatively easy access to the interior abdominal wall allowing the surgeon to perform the ideal repair for that patient. It also might allow for standardization of surgical technique in order to develop a reliable approach to hernia repair that can be offered to an increasing number of patients." Regarding our U.S. single site business, cholecystectomy volumes continued to decline during the fourth quarter, though mostly offset by a growth in multiport cholecystectomies. In addition, our single site gynecology procedure volumes declined in the fourth quarter. Taken together, single site procedures represented less than 5% of our fourth quarter U.S. procedure volume. Looking abroad during the fourth quarter, the approximate 27% international procedure growth was led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. For the full year, procedure growth was approximately 26%. Procedure growth in Europe remained steady throughout 2015. In Asia, procedure growth was led by broad-based adoption in China and South Korea and da Vinci prostatectomy adoption in Japan. During 2016, we expect several external factors to impact international procedure growth. In Japan, the Surgical Society has submitted for reimbursement of partial nephrectomies to the MHLW. Pending the MHLW's decision, this may serve as a tailwind to Japanese procedure growth. In China, we have placed 32 of the 38 da Vinci systems under the current authorization and sustaining strong procedure growth throughout 2016 may require additional authorizations from the government. During the quarter, the global evidence for the cost-effectiveness for the use of da Vinci surgery in gynecologic oncology continued to build. A new study from Copenhagen University Hospital by Dr. Hurley and colleagues modeled the clinical and economic impact of the adoption of da Vinci for malignant hysterectomies capturing the comprehensive cost of care associated with these interventions. The study compared 158 open hysterectomies to 202 da Vinci hysterectomies and found that da Vinci hysterectomies were 17% less expensive than open hysterectomies based on operating cost and 7% less expensive than open hysterectomies when the da Vinci system cost was included. The study found the cost savings associated with fewer complications and shorter hospitalization more than offset the incremental costs associated with the use of da Vinci technology in the operating room. 2015 was a robust year for clinical publications featuring da Vinci surgery with over 1,600 papers published during the year, bringing total clinical publications to over 10,000. This concludes my remarks. I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our financial outlook for 2016. Starting with procedures, as described in our announcement last week, 2015 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 14% to roughly 652,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2016, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 9% to 12%. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2016 as we have experienced in previous years with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. With respect to revenue, we expect 2016 capital sales to follow historical seasonal patterns, which we anticipate will become more pronounced with Q1 being sequentially lower than the recently completed Q4. System placements will likely continue to be lumpy, particularly in markets outside of the U.S. as some of these markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales in to some markets are constrained by government regulations. Turning to gross profit. We expect our 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 68% and 69.5% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix. Turning to operating expenses. As Gary mentioned, we will be increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic assisted surgery. We expect to grow 2016 operating expenses between 9% and 13% above 2015 levels. We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016, compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $20 million and $25 million in 2016. With regard to income tax, we expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and oUS profits. This forecast does reflect the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2016. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
David Roman: Thank you and good evening everybody. I wanted to start with just one strategic question and one follow up on the financial guidance that Calvin just provided. Maybe on the strategic side, I was hoping Gary you could go into your thoughts as it relates to the competitive landscape in robotics? We have heard over the past several months announcement from a couple of emerging competitors and there is an expected announcement from another competitor later in 2016. Can you maybe talk about how you envision the competitive landscape unfolding and some of the activities you maybe undertaking to prepare Intuitive for moving from a monopoly type market to one that has multiple players?
Gary Guthart: Sure. As we look at value and competition, at the end of the day, value is going to be driven by the ability of these products and services to drive great outcomes and compared or weighed against the price of those things. So we think about it as an ecosystem. We think the ecosystem is really important. So it's easy to think just about the robotic system because that's the most visible part, but there is the systems, the instruments and accessories, advanced instrumentation like stapling, imaging systems, fluorescence imaging, training technologies like stimulators and dual console, clinical validation training courses offered by academic surgeons that number in the dozens, that whole set of products and ecosystem, we think, is important. And so as competitors enter, they have to choose. Can they show that value in terms of outcomes and price and can they offer the set of ecosystem elements that they are going to be a useful? We have known for years and have anticipated for years. We didn't wake up yesterday and think competitors are coming, we better do something. So we have been thoughtful about what we need to do to create value for our customers. We have a range of products in the system side that has different price points for different feature content. We have different options that are available in terms of instrumentation price points. And so we think we are really well positioned. There are some other companies out there that will be capable. We expect that customers will explore what they are offering. We think we are well positioned when that exploration occurs.
David Roman: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just to go into the financial side for a second. Just trying to understand what you are saying on the margins for 2016. The gross margin range seems to imply that on an underlying basis, when you take of the benefit of the medical device tax you are seeing a deterioration from where you sort of exited the second half of 2015? What are the factors influencing that math? And then on the OpEx side, the 9% to 13% represents a pretty decent acceleration from what we saw this year. Can you maybe help put some of those investments into context? Where those dollars are going? And whether 2016 represents a new normal year of investment spending? Or there is something particular that you are after this year?
Calvin Darling: Sure, David. I will take you through some of the gross profit commentary and let Gary take you through some of the investments on the OpEx side. Like Gary said on the call, we are focused on reducing our cost of the new products and we have been managing our fixed cost very carefully. We are pleased with the progress we have been making throughout 2015. Our second half 2015 gross profit benefited from favorable product mix, essentially zero product charges and other favorable outcomes. In 2016, we do expect to deliver continued cost reductions on the newer products, including the Xi, stapler, vessel sealer and Xi endoscopes. At the same time, as compared to the second half of 2015, we would expect a higher proportion of 2016 sales to be of the newer products. We would expect a lower proportion of dual console systems sales, probably higher proportion of system sales involving trade-ins and probably some product charges. At some point, we would be more line with historical norms from the past. And while FX is not likely to be as strong a headwind as it was in 2015, it does appears as though it will have some negative impact on revenue and margins. And then lastly, I would say, from a competitive side, any pressure there or the impacts of that are unknown at this stage.
Gary Guthart: On the ultimately investment side, as I mentioned in the script, we think that there is significant opportunity to improve what surgeons can see during cases improving imaging through a variety of means technologically and we have been working on that for years and we will continue to do so. I think there is great potential there. On the instrumentation side, we are expanding our stapling line and our advanced energy lines. The reception has been quite good. Those are not single instruments. They are really families of instruments and we are filling out those families as we go. We feel good about it and think it's important we will continue to invest there and we think that there are opportunities in robotics in terms of both structure, things like SP and other things that can change different segments of the market that can allow us to enter other procedures that we are not currently in today or access other regions of the world that may have different needs. And so we will continue investing in those things.
David Roman: Okay. I appreciate all the detail. Thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question for the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Sorry, I want to come back to margins here for a second. The spread on margins and maybe Marshall or Calvin, so it's 68% to 69.50%, it's a wider spread of how you gave us the spread last year. So what defines the upper end and lower end of those ranges? And I guess secondarily, when I think about these product manufacturing improvements you are making, we seem to have a substantial impact on gross margins in the second half of the year. I guess I would presume those advantages or those costs would be a bigger tailwind in 2016 over 2015. Is that kind of a correct statement? Those two questions and I have a quick follow-up.
Marshall Mohr: To characterize the cost reductions, they had some impact in the second half of 2015. They will have a more significant impacted in 2016 and 2017. As Calvin had said, we will continue to focus on reducing the costs. I think the bigger improvement during 2015 had to do with the lack of product charges that we mentioned in Q1. And as we move forward, the range has really, the breadth of the range is really reflective of the items that Calvin gave you, which is that we expected to see a higher proportion of newer products, the extent of that we will see. We expect to see a lower proportion of dual consoles and a higher proportion of trade-ins. The mix of systems is always difficult to predict. And frankly geographic mix also has an implication here. And as I said in my script, there is a quite a bit of lumpiness to some of those geographic markets.
David Lewis: Okay. And then Gary just a quick strategic and margin question for you as well. So the expense to saw a couple years ago, you made a selective decision just to reinvest, This is a 50% increase in OpEx spending relative to 15%, 400 to 500 basis points above. Do you see this similarly as the opportunity to reinvest? And is the investments spend heavier on SG&A or R&D? And the follow-up is, on Sp as you mentioned, in light of what's happening with single site procedures, has that changes your thinking of the opportunity around Sp? Sorry for the couple of couple questions there. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Sure. Yes. In terms of the balance of investment, it really is targeted in a couple of areas. R&D is clearly one area that will get investment and then support for international markets and some of those things are more structural, not necessarily just sales folks but clinical trials and other things. So that's where the balance or the bulk of that increase is going to lay in. And we think we have technologies that are important and we think we have process that we can bring that's important and that will serve us well in the long-term and in the future. With regard to Sp, vis-à-vis single site, we think that Sp really enters and adds value in a different place than single site does. Single site tended to work on a little bit more limited workspace, a little bit more constrained set of procedures. Sp is both broader and more capable. Price points are a little bit different. So we think about Sp when we think transoral, transanal, colorectal, places where there is specimen removal. So we look at those things. We think about it. Sp is less oriented towards cosmetic benefits and more aimed towards being able to reach complex structures where you need to.
David Lewis: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we question for the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Tao Levy: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. So maybe we can start with U.S. system utilization. When you do the math, you are reaching peak levels here in the U.S. in terms of averages. And so what's the dynamic currently in the marketplace whereby hospitals could potentially accelerate the addition of new systems in order to meet your procedure growth expectations that you have laid out?
Gary Guthart: Yes. To make sure I understand the question right, I think as we look at utilization patterns, one thing is important to remember around the world, but in the U.S. as well, is there is not a single customer profile that fits them all. So the average does not cover all the endpoints. And so we definitely see some integrated delivery networks who are very interested in optimizing procedures per system per year and just trying to drive that up to get better capital utilization and we will help them do that. We see other health systems that maybe in the exact same market, who were really interested in driving convenience for patients and for their surgeons and are willing to invest in capital once they get the minimum hurdle rate for procedure use or utilization. And so we see both. Predicting which of those strategies is going to dominate into the year is always a little bit hard. And at the end of the day, we really focus the organization on great utilization and great support, whichever strategy our customer wants to take us down.
Tao Levy: Okay. And just my follow-up, you have talked a couple of times about investing more and more into imaging and aside from Firefly, we haven't seen anything very significant come out of other companies. So maybe you could highlight a couple of the interesting projects within imaging that we should be paying attention to? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Sure. I think, the first statement is, I beg to differ, but I look at the imaging platform that we brought out with Xi and it's a fundamentally different technology basis, distal chip imaging. That gives us room to do some things from usability, reach and workflow point of view that were very hard to do otherwise. And so we continue down that pathway. So for example, in Xi, you can move the scope arm-to-arm, There is not a dedicated robot to hold one endoscope. So that gives you the idea of port hopping, the ability to look around the abdomen differently. The other thing that distal chip imaging gets you is the ability to articulate your endoscope which is a part of the Sp product line is endoscopic articulation. We continue to invest in that technology and expand our leadership position there because I think that both you can get better image quality and more flexibility and better price points by doing that technology. So that's one set of investments. The other set is, as you mentioned with Firefly, the ability to look and see things that you can't see easily with a white light. So the ability to look and see beneath tissue or to highlight tissue structure and there are a set of technologies there that are useful and we are investing in, but those are longer term. They take a while to develop and as we get further down the pipeline we will share with you where we are.
Tao Levy: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ben Andrew: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. On the initial Sp use, Gary, that you talked about and you listed a few applications there, should we assume that's where we will see some initial clinical work? And when might we see results from those, either published or discussed? Is that later this year, next year that maybe leads to next steps of commercializing the product?
Gary Guthart: Right. Yes. In terms of first question, those are places where we are intended to explore. So colorectal and in transoral. We will also explore other places in time but those are our initial experience. We expect to have our initial experiences. In terms of timelines, I am not ready yet to tell you when in the year it will happen. We are still in conversations with regulatory bodies about pathway and so as we get some clarity there, then we will describe to you later in the year.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And on that same main, if you look out three or four years, can the Sp platform be a material percentage of the company's volumes? Or is this something that probably remains a niche given the price point and we shouldn't really think differently about the distribution of 5% or 10%, if you will?
Gary Guthart: I think that it offers surgeons a different way to think about getting into the body and a different approach. It can deliver a lot of capability in a small package parallel into the body and it can move about the body quite easily in terms of multi-quadrant access. So I think it's hard to predict long-term. I think, for sure, near-term there are initiatives that I think it matters. Whether those initiatives grow into bigger opportunities, I think remains to be seen. Having said that, the history of Intuitive and the history of technology is that as you bring raw technology into the hands of experts and they start to use and then develop it a way leads to way and I believe that. I think that we will see things that develop as surgeons get deep with it. How big that gets, impossible to predict right now.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then lastly for me. Thank you for taking the question, by the way. The range of procedure guidance is a little wide to start the year obviously. And let's just try to isolate one effect if we can, China. So if we don't see another authorization for system sales, is that a material impact within the range? Is that a percentage point or two in terms of a potential swing? Or how should we look at, for example China specifically?
Calvin Darling: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ben. When it comes to procedure guidance, our focus is going to continue to be on driving growth in general surgery in our international markets, including China. When you look at the breadth of the range to your question, there is far bigger impact than just the system authorization in China when it comes to the mature procedures in the U.S. and the rates of growth that we may see there that benefited us in 2015 and certainly across a much wider range of markets.
Ben Andrew: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
J.P. McKim: Hi everyone. This is actually J.P., in for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get back to the margin profile for next year and ask it in a more simple way. So if you exclude the 70 basis points that you gain through the med tax credit, given the guidance you gave for OpEx next year, would we be expecting the adjusted EBIT margins to actually be down year-over-year?
Calvin Darling: Yes. I think there are a lot of layered assumptions that go into the model and we don't have specific guidance as it relates to that. Revenue would be one of factors certainly underlying the overall assumptions. So I think what we tried to do is lay out a lot of factors that would be impacting the gross margin as well as the investments we are making on the expense side.
J.P. McKim: Got it. And if I could ask one on the recent clearance to the integrated table motion. How is that sale going to be? And how are guys going to get revenue from that? Is that going to be sales from Trumpf Medical and you guys would get a piece of the revenue? Or how will that work?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I would say, Trumpf will sell the table in an independent transaction to the hospital. What we get out of it is, we sell a software upgrade package for the table that allows it to operate it in an integrated fashion.
Calvin Darling: Yes. I think for us the key here is we are working to make the operation more efficient, right. This will make the ability for surgeons to reposition the patient without having to withdraw the robot arms, redock during a procedure, make it more efficient and therefore it benefits certain groups of procedures and hopefully drive adoption. I think that's really the key benefit from our perspective.
J.P. McKim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We do question the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Hopkins: Thanks and good afternoon. So I wanted to ask a question about 2016 revenue growth to start. Can you give us a sense as to where you see incremental opportunities for acceleration? So what are the areas where you see or product categories where you see the potential for accelerating revenue growth or entirely new growth drivers in 2016 versus what you experienced in 2015? Obviously we are well aware what the major growth drivers are, I am curious about the things that potentially are available to you in 2016 that weren't available in 2015.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. As you know, we look at 2016 in a couple places. I think that we have opportunities in oUS markets in various places that are important to us. Now there are some structural things that we have to overcome in and invest in and sometimes they are reimbursement and sometimes there are other parts of market access and we will do that. But I think the opportunity there is quite good. I think in terms of other verticals we are working on a 30 millimeter stapler, the 30-millimeter stapler is really targeted at thoracic procedures. Xi system design, part of it's design intent was to facilitate thoracic procedures and we are in early days there. So as time goes on, I don't think that's something that's going to leap out of the gate in the beginning part of the year, but things we are investing in from a product and support point of view that should build momentum over the next multiple quarters.
Bob Hopkins: And then Marshall, to follow-up on two quick things. On the revenue per procedure number and you highlighted, that's been very stable within a range but it feels like the cadence of new products will pickup as we move forward there. Can we expect that line item to start moving back up towards the old highs as we go forward here? And then the other quick thing I wanted to ask of you is, I appreciate the comment that 70% of revenues now come from disposables. Can you give us a rough sense as to what the relative profitability of that disposable stream is versus the capital side of the business?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. So first, talking about the range of I&A revenue per procedure, we would hope that we would be able to add to that number through increases in the advanced instrumentation including stabling and vessel sealing. As I said, that's been somewhat muted or offset by the effects of foreign-exchange over the last few quarters but there are other factors that could change that. I don't know what the historical high you are speaking about was, but I do think that there is room for it to grow going forward.
Bob Hopkins: It was about $2,000, I think.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. And then remember, that number has in it stocking orders and timing of other things. So longer-term, as you have a bigger and bigger install base, the relative value of stocking orders is going to go down and that has nothing to do with sort of the pure economics of the exchange. The other question was around recurring revenue and remember it's not just instruments, it is also service.
Calvin Darling: Yes. That's about 50% is instruments and accessories of revenue and 20% would be the service element to get to the 70% total recurring.
Marshall Mohr: And the margins on instruments and accessories are better than systems. And so as we get a quarter where we have a higher systems, then the margins are going to be lower.
Calvin Darling: And that trend is likely to be durable, the I&A and service will be higher margin than systems.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brandon Henry: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So Intuitive has now shown two years of strong U.S. urology growth. Can you discuss the reason for this outperformance in urology and how sustainable you think this strong performance is in 2016?
Gary Guthart: Yes. Brandon, thanks for the question. A year ago, you saw a turnaround in the volumes of da Vinci prostatectomy in the U.S. kind of at the midpoint of the year and the back half of the year started to see some growth and that's sustained throughout 2015. And the rate of growth has been certainly above what we believe the incidence rates of prostrate cancer to be in the country. And also within U.S. urology is growth in partial nephrectomy as well which has been pretty consistent and sustained given the profile of what da Vinci technology brings to that procedure from both clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness perspective. As we look at 2016, our baseline assumption is that the high levels of growth that we have seen over the last six quarters are likely to begin returning more towards the incidence rates of the disease.
Brandon Henry: Okay. And then one quick question on Sp. Can you talk about why you decided to develop Sp as essentially an add-on to Xi platform and not as it's own standalone platform? And then maybe also talk about your expectations for Sp instrumentation and launch? Do you anticipate having a vessel sealer and a stapler at launch that will work with Sp? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Yes. On the reason to make it compatible with Xi, I think is really a straightforward thing which is, a lot of the components are shared in terms of surgeon's console and imaging systems. We want customer experience to be seamless for our customers. We think there are surgeons who will go back and forth between Sp and Xi and what that means is that you want the user experience to be common. We also make it easier for hospital departments to acquire capital. If they already have a dual console or an Xi and they want to just add Sp card capability that makes the capital hurdle for them lower. And so it strengthens the Xi ecosystem and I think that is a good idea and it is well received. So that has made sense for us. We haven't yet announced what our instrument kit will be for Sp and when we get to that point, we will let you know.
Brandon Henry: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one on Sp and then I had one on the rotating bed. On Sp, Gary did you say that you are moving into clinical testing or some sort of limited launch by the end of this year? Does that mean that's your official launch at the end of 2016?
Gary Guthart: We don't expect material revenues in 2016. We are planning on clinical experiences in 2016.
Richard Newitter: Okay. Got it. And then on Sp, on the approval process, I know you said that it's in discussion with the FDA right now. There is a competitor of yours that has a device that they are saying that they think they can get approval for their device based on larger buckets or broader definitions of categories like urological procedures or general abdominal procedures. Can you help us understand if this is something that you have heard the FDA say to you as well? Or is it more nuanced than that and you need to go much more specific by individual procedures?
Gary Guthart: Yes. So the issue of broad claim language versus narrower claim language actually was a part of the discussion at the FDA workshop and I can refer you to those minutes and you will see pretty much what the exchange has been. The issue I would not view that as something that's architecture dependent or only offered to a certain company. That has to do -- and FDA is going to respond to these kind of products in like manner as far as I can tell and so that comes down to -- FDA asked for a certain amount of data based on the kind of things you want to talk to your customer about. And if you just want to talk about broad things and not specific things, then they asked for one set of data and the more specific you get, the more data they ask for around that set of specifics. So in general, it's a matching of data requirements with claims. And so they are describing to you a strategy around what they think they can do from a data requirement point of view. I think the playing field will be leveled here and to the extent that customers need a certain amount of information, then it's just going to be for all of us to go create that data and deliver it.
Richard Newitter: Got it. And just lastly on the bed. Can you help us understand what procedures, if any or certain types of surgeons that might have been on the sidelines for whom this product might push them over the fence and really drive adoption into procedures that otherwise might have been slower to adopt? Is there any specific procedures that could really open up? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Yes. General surgeons routinely use that motion to do two things, to use gravity as a retractor. So it's an extra hand using gravity and for the anesthesiologist who manage the patient in terms of positioning with regard to other vital signs and things like that. So in procedures where you are trying to manage bowel for example, it is really helpful to have table motion and that is clearly something that jumps out. However once we have had it, we have now been CE marked in Europe and we have had a trial in different specialties, I think it's appeal is broad. So we thought about it upfront initially around general surgery. I think its appeal will be broader than that.
Richard Newitter: Thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Gary Guthart: Rick, you will be our last questioner.
Rick Wise: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it, Gary. Maybe just to start with you Gary, you said several times in the course of your prepared remarks and then the Q&A that robotics is in its infancy. Just a big picture for a second, are you emphasizing it because perhaps this next wave of pipeline products that you have talked about and maybe some you haven't talked about are getting you more confident or excited about the potential for another growth reacceleration or an inflection point in the adoption of robotic surgery. I appreciate the number of systems placed relative to hospitals is small but just wondered if there was anything more there.
Gary Guthart: Sure. I think a couple of things that excites me and leads me to believe there is a lot of opportunity, couple. One of them is that I think in the architectures we are in today in the markets for which we have clearances, there is still a lot of procedures that are being done open and have opportunity to be done minimally invasively with our products. And I think that comes down to execution and delivery of some of things we have in the pipeline. Having said that, I think that as you just stand back and look out over the next decade and ask, do we think that robotic assisted surgery can impact more procedures or more types of procedures than they are being impacted today, I think the answer to that is, absolutely yes. Some things are things like Sp, products that look different. Sp won't be the last set of products that look different. We think there are opportunities for other products and technologies that can really make a difference in surgeons delivering great care. And so we are excited about it. And we are investing in it and I think ask just about any surgeon, do you think that the use of computation analytics and robotics is going to improve your practice over time or become less important, the answered is pretty uniform that those kinds of technologies should help them if they are well delivered and well executed.
Rick Wise: Got you. Two last quick ones I will ask at the same time. Estimating accessories growth, I think for the first time in at least five quarters, maybe longer, certainty since 2012 annually did grow faster than procedures. Is there something that we should read into that with implications on next couple of years? Or is it just stocking, given the flattish revenues per procedure? And the second one I will throw at you at the same time, the bed approval. You launched it in Europe in 2015. Just maybe get your early experience there. Did it drive utilization or procedures or Xi or capital sales? Any color there would be welcome. Thanks. I appreciate it.
Calvin Darling: Yes. On the revenue per procedure, I don't think that's much more than what we said. There is a lot of factors that impact that particular metric. It has been running at a pretty tight range, $1,830 to $1,840. It did tick over to a growth this last quarter as we saw utilization of advanced instruments kind of more than offset some of the headwinds mostly from exchange. But again, I think a lot of those factors could vary in the future in terms of procedure mix, customer efficiency, buying pattern, foreign exchange. So it's really a lot of factors there.
Gary Guthart: On Xi, the surgeon feedback has been outstanding. Too soon to tell in terms of number of sites and duration as to what the changes in trends are, but we will be watching. Thanks, Rick. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during the conference call, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. I hope the following comments from Dr. Solomon, a general surgeon from Orlando, Florida gives you some sense of the impact our products have in surgery. "The advanced technologies and improved dexterity of the da Vinci Xi system have allowed me to perform complex minimally invasive operations with a statistically measurable improvement in outcomes. Our patients are clearly and reproducibly benefiting from less pain, a shorter length of hospital stay, less time off work and lower short and long-term complications." We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and we look forward to talking to you again in three months.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q3 2015 Earnings Release Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And also as a reminder, today’s teleconference is being recorded. And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Director of Finance, Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead sir
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer and Patrick Clingan, Senior Director of Finance and sales operations. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 5th, 2015, and 10-Q, filed on July 22nd, 2015. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com, on the audio archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third-quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights; Marshall will provide a review of our third-quarter financial results; Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights and I will provide our updated financial outlook for 2015. And finally we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us on the call today. Overall, company performance in the quarter was solid with robust procedure growth, solid capital performance and improved operating margins. Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the third quarter accelerated to 15% compared with Q3 2014. Procedure performance mirrored our experience in the first half of the year with strength in hernia repair, colon and rectal resections, solid growth in prostatectomy, and stable trends in hysterectomy. Internationally growth trends in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter. Growth in Europe, China and Korea was multi-disciplinary with particular strength in neurology. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. Turning to capital sales, we placed 117 systems in the quarter compared to 111 in the third quarter of 2014. Capital placements in The United States accounted for most of the growth in system placements year-over-year. Customers are preferring our most capable products and Xi systems and dual console configurations represented a larger proportion of placements in the quarter relative to a year ago. In Japan, procedure growth was solid and driven by growth in neurology. As we’ve said on prior calls, the growth of the market in Japan will be paced by continued progress on reimbursement.  Clinical investigators are submitting their partial nephrectomy data to MHLW for review, and ISI continues to work with key stakeholders in the reimbursement for additional procedures. While we have no assurance of additional procedure reimbursement at this time Japanese authorities will review reimbursement submission for partial nephrectomy for inclusion in 2016 national coverage. Conversations regarding reimbursement for other procedures are ongoing, however inclusion of other procedures and full reimbursement guidelines in 2016 are unlikely. Turning to operating performance, our product operations teams have been focused on reducing cost for our new products and we have been managing our fixed expenses carefully. This quarter was another step in the right direction on gross margin, helped by product mix and some costs coming in at the lower end of their expected ranges. We will continue to focus on improvements in direct product cost over the next several quarters. As we look at long term financial position of our products we anticipate making targeted capital investments over the next few quarter and programs that we believe will facilitate better long term product and operating margins. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call. In summary, our operating performance for the third quarter is as follows. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the third quarter of last year. We placed 117 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 111 in the third quarter of 2014. Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $590 million, up 10% from the prior year, and up 14% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $298 million, up 10% over prior year. We generated pro forma operating profit of $240 million in the quarter compared with $197 million in the third quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $199 million compared to $145 million in Q3 of 2014. We are deeply committed to advancing our technologies and offerings to benefit surgeons, their patients and hospitals. We have launched integrated table motion for Xi in Europe this October and have submitted our U.S. 510(k) application. Table motion allow surgeons to interactively use gravity for retraction and eases patient management during da Vinci Xi surgical cases. As many of you saw at the American College of Surgeons meeting earlier this month, initial customer feedback has been strong. We also submitted our 510(k) for our single site instrument kit for Xi in the third quarter with the intent of bringing our single-incision tools to the Xi platform. In addition, we submitted a 510(k) application for a 30 millimetre stapler for Xi in the third quarter. This instrument has particular utility in thoracic surgery and includes a multi staple sizes including green, blue, white and grey reloads. Regarding our next generation single-port technology, our technical teams continue to meet their development milestones for da Vinci Sp, having completed the build of our first 10 Xi compatible systems, five of which were slated for human clinical use. We anticipate increased clinical evaluations of da Vinci Sp in 2016 particularly in transoral and transabdominal applications. Lastly, da Vinci systems are sophisticated network computing systems. The availability of these computational resources allows for both real time analytics that can provide surgeons relevant information for example the smart plant feature implemented in our stapler as well as anonymized utilization data that administration can use to help optimize robotic surgery programs. We are developing increased computational capability in both real time and program level applications along with the field force of work flow experts; this analytic capability allows us to aid our customers both during surgery and in optimizing their robotic surgery programs. As we’ve discussed on prior calls for 2015 we remain focused on expanding the application of da Vinci and general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair filling out our product line for da Vinci Xi and launching in key markets globally, developing our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia, advancing our technologies to improve surgery and lowering our direct product cost. I’ll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review our financial performance.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP, and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We've posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. Pro forma third quarter revenue was $590 million, an increase of 10% compared with $534 million for the third quarter of 2014, and an increase of 1% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the third quarter of 2014 excludes net revenue associated with the offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for Xi product. All trade out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. Third quarter 2015 procedures of approximately 162,000 grew approximately 15% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and were approximately equal to the second quarter of 2015. Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument, and accessory revenue grew 10% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and was approximately equal to the second quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth, partially offset by foreign exchange and customer buying patterns. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure. This metric has now been trending in a tight range between $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure over the past four quarters with recent quarters reflecting higher sales of new instruments and the impact of foreign exchange. Pro forma system revenue of $174 million increased 13% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales, and higher average system selling prices. The decrease relative to the second quarter reflects a higher number of operating leases partially offset by higher average systems sales prices.  117 systems were placed in the third quarter compared with 111 systems in the third quarter of 2014 and 118 systems last quarter. 77% of the systems placed this quarter were Xis compared with 53% in the third quarter of 2014, and 64% in the second quarter of 2015. We expect the mix of Xi to Si product to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Globally, our average systems price of $1.6 million increased compared with $1.45 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $1.5 million last quarter. Our third quarter 2015 ASP was our highest to date, reflecting an unusually high mix of dual consoles, including a high number of shipments to academic centers. We shipped 29 dual console Xis in the third quarter of 2015 compared with 13 last year and 18 last quarter. We expect to return to our historical mix of dual consoles and therefore expect our future ASP to be lower than this quarter. ASPs fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on geographic and product mix trade-in volume and changes in foreign exchange rates. Hospitals financed approximately 25% of the systems placed in the third quarter, up from 21% last quarter. We directly financed 20 systems; including placing the most operating leases 13 since we began our direct leasing program in the second quarter of 2014. As of the end of the quarter there were 36 systems out in the field under operating leases. Revenue from operating leases was less than 2 million in the third quarter. We expect the impacts of operating leases from our system if we exclude the impacts of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. The number of systems placed under operating leases will vary quarter-to-quarter. Service revenue of $170 million increased 8% year-over-year and increased approximately 4% compared with the second quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect the increase in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows; third quarter pro forma revenue outside of the U.S. of $151 million decreased 1% compared with $153 million for the third quarter of 2014, and decreased 10% compared with $168 million last quarter. The decrease compared with the previous year reflects lower system sales into China and the impact of foreign exchange partially offset by higher recurring revenue driven by approximately 28% higher procedure volume. The decrease compared with the last quarter was driven by lower system unit sales and timing of customer instrument and accessory sales. Outside the U.S., we placed 37 systems in the third quarter compared with 50 in the third quarter of 2014 and 46 systems last quarter o-US system placements included 9 systems into Japan compared with seven last year and 13 last quarters. 19 systems in Europe compared with 25 last year and 22 last quarter and no systems into China this quarter compared with 10 last year and none last quarter. System placements will continue to fluctuate quarter to quarter. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, the pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2015 was 69.3% compared with 67.2% for the third quarter of 2014 and 68% for the second quarter of 2015. Compared with both the second quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2014 the higher third quarter of 2015 gross margin reflects higher systems ASPs, improved efficiencies, lower inventory charges among other factors. The increase in gross margins relative to the third quarter of 2014 also reflects charges to cost and sales related to the Si staple recall in 2014. In 2014, we recorded pre tax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we have refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $14 million in the first half of the year. There were no charges in the third quarter of 2015. Charges made related to this agreement are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. At the end of the third quarter, $30 million remained accrued on our balance sheet as a significant portion of the estimated cost have been paid. Pro forma operating cost, which excludes the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense, and the amortization of purchased IP, increased 4% compared with the third quarter of 2014 and were less 1% less than last quarter. The year-over-year increase in pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.2% for the third quarter of 2014 and 25.6% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 included tax benefits of $29 million, or $0.77 per share related to a recent favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of o-US and U.S. income, and will not reflect a federal research and development credit, unless such credit is reinstated. Our third quarter 2015 pro forma income was $199 million or $5.24 per share compared with $145 million or $3.92 per share for the third quarter of 2014 and $173 million or $4.57 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the prior period tax benefits our third quarter 2015 pro forma net income was $170 million or $4.47 per share. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $590 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared with $550 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $586 million for the second quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015, compared with $124 million or $3.35 per share for the third quarter of 2014 and $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.1 billion, up from $2.9 billion as of June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter we repurchased approximately 70,000 shares for $36 million and average purchase price of $509 per share. This brings our total stock repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan: Thanks Marshall. As mentioned earlier, total third quarter year-over-year procedures grew approximately 15% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12% and international procedures growing approximately 28%. In the U.S. third quarter procedure growth were approximately 12% accelerated modestly from first half growth of approximately 10% driven by an uptick in the growth of general surgery procedures with solid contribution coming from mature procedures despite already high levels of market penetration, remains uncertain how sustainable, the year to-date growth in these mature procedures will be in future periods. In urology trends observed during the first half of the year continued through the third quarter. Growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at similar rate as the first half of 2015 with da Vinci prostatectomy again exceeding our expectation. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. In gynecology, third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy partially offset by declines in benign procedures. Similar to the first half of the year, increased proportion of total hysterectomy procedures have been performed by gynecologic oncologists. Third quarter growth in general surgery increased compared to the first half of the year with robust growth in hernia repair and an uptick in colorectal procedures, being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. Hernia repair continued to drive the majority of growth in general surgery procedures during the quarter. Earlier this month at the American College of Surgeons meeting several presentations highlighted the emerging role of da Vinci surgery in ventral and inguinal hernia repair. Surgeons commented on the advantages of da Vinci surgery which include precise dissection, improved visualization, secure closure of the primary defect, application casing of the abdominal wall, suture fixation of mesh and a reduction in postoperative pain for patients. Specific ventral hernia repair Doctor Ballacer from the Banner Health Network compared 180 da Vinci hernia repairs to over 60,000 lap and open hernia repairs from the ACS National Surgery Quality Improvement Program database and found that reduction in hospital length of stay and complication saved approximately $550 per case compared laparoscopy and over $700 per case compared to open surgery. We are encouraged by these early clinical and economic validations around the use of da Vinci surgery in hernia repair. Regarding our Single-Site cholecystectomy business as we've stated over the past four quarters, our total cholecystectomy procedures decline through the rate -- though the rate of decline moderated in the third quarter. As growth in multiport cholecystectomies offset much of the decline in Single-Site cholecystectomy, as our belief that customer are finding added value in a more complex patient population, therefore gravitating to the traditional da Vinci multiport approach. Firefly technology was used in approximately 40% of da Vinci cholecystectomies in the quarter. Looking abroad during the third quarter, the approximate 28% international procedure growth was led by global adoption of da Vinic prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies, colorectal resections. Procedure growth in Europe remains steady through the first nine months of the year, while the acceleration in procedure growth in Asia that began during the first half of the year continued into the third quarter. During the quarter the global evidence supporting the cost effectiveness of da Vinic prostatectomy in international markets continue to build. Our recent economic analysis from the Peter Maccullum Cancer Centre in Australia published in BJU International reviewed nearly 6,000 Prostatectomies from the Victorian Admitted Episode Dataset. Their analysis found da Vinci Prostatectomy to be cost equivalent open Prostatectomy where 140 da Vinic procedures per year were performed on the system well below the global third quarter annualized average of approximately 190 procedures per system. During the study period from 2010 to 2013, the rate of open Prostatectomies decline from approximately 73% to 47% among publish hospital in Victoria due to an increase in the adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy. This concludes my remarks and I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures, on our last call we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth between 11% and 13% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. We are now increasing our procedure estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth of between 13% and 14%. Turning to gross profit, our outlook for gross profit margin has again modestly improved compared to last quarter. We expect our fourth quarter 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 67.5% to 68.5 % of revenue. Note that this range is a bit lower than our third quarter gross margin as Q3 benefited from favorable product mix and other factors which we expect to return to more typical patterns in Q4. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix, system's production volume and foreign exchange rates. Turning to operating expenses, consistent with our last call, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses towards the lower end of a range of between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. Also consistent with our last call we expect our 2015 non-cash stock compensation expense to come in towards the lower end of 170 million to 180 million range, roughly flat compared to 169 million in 2014. We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $16 million and $18 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, for Q4 we expect our pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pre-tax income consistent with our previous estimate. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ben Andrew: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess two things for us. If you look at the legacy U.S. procedures, Gary, we talked in August about some of the hospital systems looking more carefully at cost benefit analysis. Do you think that's supporting the complex dVH and dVP and are you getting more evidence that that's the case?
Gary Guthart: Yes. We've seen, I can speak to anecdotes. Anecdotally, the dVPs and some of the more complex procedures we've seen have been well supported by analysis done at the IDN level. They are getting more sophisticated in those analyses and I think they are getting more confident in them.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then, as far as the kind of international procedure growth, that was an exceptional acceleration. How durable is that as we look at 2016 with Europe kind of steady growth, U.S. obviously a little bit above plan, but that Asian piece, it really sort of sticks out?
Gary Guthart: Yes. It depends on the country. So, if you go country by country in Asia I think Korea has been building nicely. I don't see radical changes one way or the other. Japan we've talked about, I think that there's a lot of interest and a lot of organic activity, but major penetration is going to require reimbursement. China, we saw a lot of acceleration. And the pacing there will be in part driven by capital placements and as you know well, there's a quota system in China, so there are some systems remaining on the quota that can be placed. There's a point at which you need a new quota to keep going. So we can get some growth in the existing installed base, although to really accelerate quickly you need additional systems and that something that Calvin can take you through little later in the Q&A.
Ben Andrew: Sure. And just last thing is the China zero last quarter, zero this quarter, anything to read there as it kind of a bolus effect in the year end? And obviously the quota being the quota, but how do we think about that from a consistency perspective over time? Thanks.
Marshall Mohr: Yes. This is Marshall. There's a process behind it. The quota was provided year and a half ago, two years ago. There are 18 systems that remained on the quota, but there's a tender process that each of the hospitals have to undertake and the tender process is unpredictable in terms of when it will complete. It turns out that they've been completing in boluses, as you suggested. But the fact that none were completed in the last – no systems were shipped in the last two quarters, I don't necessarily believe is indicative of whether we'll ship more or less in the next couple of quarters. So, we'll see how the tenders play out and we'll see what we wind up with.
Ben Andrew: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
David Roman: Thank you and good afternoon everybody. I wanted just to start with the overall procedure volume environment, and understandably some of your comments, Patrick regarding the sustainability of some of the mature procedures may make sense. But if I look at the overall procedure volumes in the quarter, they were flat sequentially. I can't remember when in the third quarter you did not see a sequential decline, whether that was related to seasonality or some of the other factors that were influencing your business. So could you maybe just talk about what's going on in the overall environment and whether what we are seeing now is the impact of sun-setting some of the concerns that surfaced to couple of years ago, and maybe what maybe materialized in the third quarter that might have made for the outsized performance?
Gary Guthart: I'll speak to a couple of things, and Patrick, you can jump in. At the dVP level in the U.S. we really think that's the flow back into treatment of some folks who had set out in watchful waiting and then had disease progression. How long that persist is a little bit hard to predict based on some of the changes in PSA diagnostics. On the hysterectomy market we're seeing rotation of patients away from some of the lower volume surgeons in general and into higher volume and dedicated surgeons, so, GYN oncologists. That appears to be particular durable. I think that that trend makes sense and I think the activity is likely to continue. We're a large part of the dVH market and so I think the macro trend will go as the macro dVH market grows in the United States.
Patrick Clingan: The one thing to bear in mind is that for the past handful of years the number of benign hysterectomy in total has been declining, and so that will continue to counter balance the hysterectomy market.
Gary Guthart: On the upside I think we're in the beginnings of our experience in a lot of our markets. In Europe we're still in the meaty part of adoption, in many of the countries that were in. We're really excited about what can happen in Asia and the various markets that we talked about. And general surgery I think we're more at the beginning of some of the adoption that we see in colon, rectal, and hernia. So I think as you think about the future it’s a little bit of the puts and takes there of how fast do mature markets moderate and how quickly do our emerging markets grow.
David Roman: Okay. That's helpful. And then I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying explicitly about Japan for next year, obviously you have the dVP reimbursing. You talked about the society submitting on partial nephrectomy. What are the next steps in gaining additional reimbursement in Japan and how will we – how will that be disseminated?
Gary Guthart: Yes. There are multiple conversations from multiple stakeholders in Japan. Surgical societies play a role as well as government societies, in deciding what data is required and kind of in what sequence they want to address those different procedures, so from thoracic surgery to general surgery, things in the colon and others are - and gynecology, are of interest to Japanese surgeons and are in active discussion. To get into the national reimbursement, there are a couple of different pathways, wherein one of them called Senshin Iryo B for the process that we're in for partial nephrectomy. The government has asked to see that data and is going to review it. So we're not guaranteed what and when, but it’s part of the formal process. Other ones are not yet in that formal process. The government can choose to send it down a different reimbursement process. If that happens and we have some assurance that that is likely then we'll report that out to you. So, I think in terms of the near term and national coverage partial nephrectomy is the one to keep your eye on. I am not generally upset about progress. I think that there is a fair amount of interest. I think the conversations are active and it just continuing to push forward.
David Roman: And then maybe lastly Gary, as you kind of reflect on the business and look at the progress that you've made over the past call it, 18 months, you kind of put all the moving parts together with macro and one thing you’re designated as the “unintended consequence” of the Affordable Care Act or economic pressures in Europe or the state of your business. How would you just compare your view of the forward outlook today versus how you might have felt a year ago and your level of confidence?
Gary Guthart: I think that we're seeing a lot of validation for our products in the hands of our customers. I am pleased with the response from general surgeons, the level of engagement they have with the company, the interest and satisfaction they have with the products and their interest in demand for new and different things that I think we can provide. In European markets we've been investing in both capability of our own organization and getting closer to those customers. Again, I think customer demand is really strong and that looks -- that bodes really well for us. I think we can do better in terms of some of our own team and processes and we're working on it. I think that the company is growing and is focused on those efforts and I expect to see greater capability in the next several quarters.
David Roman: Okay. Thank you for all the detail.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Robert Hopkins: Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really good quarter. Two things, first I just wanted to start out for Marshall on the OpEx growth in the quarter. It was one thing that kind of surprised us. It looks like the operating expense growth in Q3 was a lot lower than we would have thought. So I was just wondering if you could kind of highlight that and it sounds like things will kind of pick back up in Q4. But is 7% to 8% still the right way to think about OpEx growth longer term and just again what happened in Q3 with the lower growth in OpEx?
Marshall Mohr: Well, certainly for rest of this year, Calvin given you guidance in the lower end of the 7% to 110% range and more like to 7%, but I think that we're focused on controlling cost and watching it carefully. There are some costs that kind of happen – when they happened and that includes a prototypes in the engineering group and some of those didn't happened this quarter and will happen next quarter and so that's why you get some of the fluctuation between quarters, but overall I think we're managing to the bottom line.
Robert Hopkins: Okay. And then just back on, Gary, back on Japan. I just want to be clear on the message there, because on the Q2 call you talked about partial nephrectomy, but then also four additional procedures. And it sounds like you're not as optimistic on those four additional procedures. So, I was wondering if you give some color on what's happened there and kind of we look to Japan as a source of real incremental procedure volume growth in 2016 or is that not the case given what you're articulating here?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I think in terms of partial nephrectomy, that's moving forward with a formal process into review for the national coverage. The conversations and the work being done on other procedures is on going, but its not yet at that level of rigor for the 2016 review and as a result I don't think its likely that they will be included in the 2016 book. We're not ready yet to give you the 2016 procedure guidance and we're working through that and rolling that up and that something we'll talk about in general in the next call. And you can anticipate that additional reimbursements accelerate in Japan and lack of it will put more pressure on procedures and they'll be part of the conversation as we go through our forecasting.
Robert Hopkins: And then any quick update on Sp in terms of timing, I heard the comments you may have a call here, but just what is the year where you think you could start to generate revenues from Sp?
Gary Guthart: Yes. We're making good progress in terms of our technology and customer valuations of the product in lab are encouraging, quite exciting. In terms of when we expect real revenue? We're not ready to tell you exactly where the revenue launch will be. We're definitely looking forward to human clinical interactions in 2016 and we'll color that up more as we go forward in future calls.
Robert Hopkins: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Rick Wise: Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. Let me start with hernia. Gary, anecdotally talking to general surgeons about Xi adoption, it sounds like a lot of the folks we have talked to start with a ventral procedure because of the suturing benefits and then seem to move quickly to inguinal as they get comfortable. Are you seeing that kind of progression, maybe to what extent, and is this process what's driving the solid hernia adoption?
Gary Guthart: We see different pathways actually, as you know as you talk to different general surgeons, I wouldn't characterize the one that you've described as the most common or the only path that folks take. It's certainly a path. No doubt that's ventral hernia is something that benefits from precise control, great visualization suturing, the ability to close the primary defect directly with suture as well as supporting [Indiscernible]. So there are some advantages there. As general surgeons get comfortable then they start to explore other things that they can do with the tool and sometimes it goes ventral, then inguinal, sometime the reverse and from there it can take them into more complex cases or cases where there is an acute called cholecystectomy that they might want to try. So there are different pathways that can happen. I wouldn't characterize one as the only.
Rick Wise: Okay. And coming back to procedures one more time, I feel like I have to ask. If I am looking at the numbers correctly, procedures, you've had a really strong year, procedure growth through the nine months, up 14%, in the third quarter, up 15%. And yet, Marshall, you're guiding us to -- if I'm understanding all these numbers correctly, 13% to 14% for the year, which suggests a softer fourth quarter against a similar comp to the third quarter. I think you grew 10% or so in both the third and fourth quarters last year. Can you help us just understand your thinking? And just given the mature procedures seem to be stable to improving and the growing stuff is still growing, what do we need to understand about the fourth quarter?
Calvin Darling: Yes, Rick. This is Calvin. And absolutely overall we're pleased with our procedure growth trends and this is actually the third quarter in a row that we've increased our guidance for procedures and the revise procedure growth assumptions generally reflect the continuation of the trends that we've seen through three quarters with growth coming from U.S general surgery and international procedures as I described. In our updated view 13% to 14%, it's lower than 15% in Q3, we're certainly at 14% on a year to-date basis. And the fact is in Q4, the comps get more difficult for those mature categories the dVPs in the United States and other mature categories whereas as Patrick described, I think maintaining the rate that you saw in the first nine months will become more challenging in the fourth quarter.
Rick Wise: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Thanks. First one, maybe a bit of a subtlety, but Gary, in your comments you talked more about the network effect and then in the press you commented on the technology ecosystem, can you maybe just elaborate on that a little bit. Are you directing additional resources to software and informatics, you need a customer is asking for more?
Gary Guthart: We have over the last few years increased our capabilities in real time software and kind of guidance tools for the surgeon as well as kind of offline Informatics. So that's not an immediate thing, it's actually been a rising trend. When you think about the ecosystems sort of stepping back as a whole, one of these products is the robot itself, the imaging system, sometimes with molecules like Firefly, instrumentation everything from needle drivers to staplers and vessel sealers, training technologies like stimulators and dual console. And then there is another piece which is Informatics. Informatics has been power force. At the surgeon level what data can you give me in real time that helps surgeon make a decision, at the institutional level it comes down to what kind of instruments you're using, how long are you on the system, what is that look like relative to national norms. And they've been interested in that data and we've been supplying that data now for over a year and those conversations been really healthy and I think it will only grow.
Tycho Peterson: And then I guess that's helping them to figure out the cost side of the equation as well?
Gary Guthart: It let them understand the couple of things, it let's than model their cost really carefully and really get the value right. The big thing in any of these conversations is total cost to treat, not price and so that helps them really understand total cost to treat. And its -- we found it to be an extremely productive and rich conversation with customer base. So, they like that. And it also gives them some sense of variation amongst different procedures and different surgeons, so they get a sense of how much variability they see within their institutions.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then on margins, you talked about reengineering some of the newer products, I know last quarter you talk little bit about longer term gross margins. Should we expect to see an impact from some of the reengineering programs in next couple of quarters, how do we think about the potential there?
Gary Guthart: So, yes, we've talked about the facts, when we introduced new products the margins are lower than mature products and lower than they'll be ultimately once that products been around for while both because we are able to drag down the cost of venders through volume as well as be able to redesign the products and we've undertaken some redesigns as well as increasing volume. I think what we've said before is that those efforts are well underway. We're happy with where they are going. They won't drive a lot of benefit this quarter, more of the benefit will be in 2016 and even more in 2017.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then you had more operating leases this quarter, can you maybe just talk about that and your willingness to use that as a lever to place more system placements in particular maybe outside U.S.?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I think what we are trying to do is to be flexible with our customers and our customers they are looking for flexibility and once we get a system installed obviously it drive procedures and instrument and accessory volumes. So, it’s a win, win, win all the way around. We did 13 this quarter. We have 36 outstanding operating leases outstanding. We're also doing capital leases. We have a number of capital leases out there. I think on the operating lease side, some of these have turned into purchases where the customers ultimately bought the product and so it again it feels like a real win situation for us to leverage our balance sheet and provide our customer flexibility to get into robotics.
Gary Guthart: They have been generally satisfied with it and we have, too.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Great. And then just lastly on hernia, are you comfortable with kind of the sustainability of the trends here for both ventral and inguinal?
Gary Guthart: I think on both sides there are sub-segments in those markets and so getting to total available market and those is little bit hard to forecast. There are definitely segments in both where we think there is good long term sustainable value. How big those segments become, I think its going to be hard to predict, we just going to have to work through it.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Tao Levy: Great. Thanks. So first question, I was wondering if maybe you can explain if there is any difference between the Xi Single-Site instruments and what’s available with the Si? And I guess, again, I scratched my head as to why someone would want to use a Xi Single-Site and just -- for chole.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Fair question. So, in terms of functionally they are functionally equivalent. So there are some small technical differences, but from in terms of what our surgeon can do, they are pretty similar. Xi has opposite couple of advantages having to do with the way the arms work. But I think for the most part you can think of them as equivalent. The reason people have a interest in them or certain number of hospitals have really room in their program for a single robotic system, if they want that mix to include Single-Site and they want to be able to operate the Xi technology, this gives them that option. So for those one system sites that let them do the full portfolio of the things they want to do.
Tao Levy: In terms of utilization of Firefly in chole, I think you mentioned about 40%. What about in other areas, like colorectal surgeries? Are you seeing any adoption of Firefly in those areas?
Gary Guthart: I will look to Patrick. I don't have the numbers at my finger tips in terms of colorectal perfusion.
Patrick Clingan: Yes. We have been seeing just use of the technology across the broad section of procedures and it’s ramped nicely over time.
Tao Levy: So just following up on that in my last question, at the ACS conference the company talked a lot about imaging being one of the biggest areas of investment for the company. So maybe if you could expand on that a little bit. What areas are you guys working on that is going to really improve patient outcomes specifically around imaging and the benefits that bring either the patients or surgeon comfort?
Gary Guthart: As we spoken before there are few things that I think are coming together that can really benefit surgeons. One of them is that sensor technology has been advancing rapidly around the world having to do with technology development for other things like cell phones. We can take advantage of that for application in surgical applications by developing sensors and products that are specific to what surgeons want to do and see, that's one dimension. The other dimension is to use other types of imaging modality, sometimes other frequency bands, sometimes molecules to allow surgeons to see things that are not visible with the naked eye. So highlight structures or highlight anatomical organisms that a surgeon wants to see during the surgery. And that since Firefly is really a platform idea not just a single molecule. And so overtime we think there are things that we can bring to market that will allow surgeons to see more and to customize their vision for the typical A procedure they want to be in.
Tao Levy: Is this five years out or two years over…
Gary Guthart: Some of them are long conference and some of them are a little thinner, so it’s really a mixture there and now ready to go into detail with you on this call is to each of the sequences but the investments we’ve made in this distal chip imaging, the step into Xi is a set of investments that we think gives us a long runway in terms of the variety of endoscopes we can deliver and the kinds of technologies we can deliver on that platform.
Tao Levy: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question in queue that will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Gary, just two quick questions, I guess the first is we think it’s pretty early to be getting excited about the competitive systems that no one on earth has seen it to put it mildly. But if you were to comment on one element of the high level I wonder and that’s the theme emerging from some of these your competitors one day is that they are talking about a smaller capital footprint which seems to be lower priced systems and I guess, do you see lower priced capital systems be more important going forward or can you continue to price the value and keep system ASPs high and a quick follow up.
Gary Guthart: I think on that first one really that’s a question that’s going to be determined by the customer and we understand that technology pretty well and have been thoughtful about it in terms of what we’ve developed. As you refer to in your question and I completely agree it’s about value not price and the question is what are the outcomes that are going to be derived by these kinds of systems and what’s the price point at which you can offer them. We have a wide range from Xi down to Si-es and Si research and that range is very large and what we find is that the majority of our customers buy capability. I think in this last quarter you can look at what the Xi to Si exchange, what that mix flows. We explore and we think about where there are other positions and price points that make sense. Certainly we hear the same kinds of customer commentary that you hear and others hear. And I think the real question is not which is shown on the shop floor, it’s what do these systems do in surgery, and that’s going to come down to what can they deliver, what kind of outcome can they deliver and that’s how we think about it.
David Lewis: Okay. Very helpful and then just a follow up on Tycho’s questions on margins. So if I take commentary from you and Marshall last couple of quarters and there is two data points that come out, it feels like gross margins above 68% and EBIT margins about 40% are going to be challenging, but then based on this quarter, it’s very clear you certainly have the ability to surpass into those two margin objectives. So Gary I think about 68% growth and 40% margin, I mean do these goal post reflect the reality and investments you are going to have to make the next several years or things about product mix or any system to reflect conservative outlook.
Gary Guthart: Yes I’m not quite sure I understood the question. I think just stepping in, I’ll tell you what we care about and where we are heading. I think that in these technologies there as we said before, there are complex mixtures of robotics and imaging and instrumentation and there is a certain amount of investment that’s required to put them in position that they are cost effective for the company and that gives us the opportunity to have them be cost effective for the customer. Those are good things to invest in. There is a point at which we believe we are early in the adoption of robotic surgery globally. And so, some of that gross margin is around the cost and some of it is around price. And what we want to be able to do is lower the price -- the cost point to us and that gives us flexibility with regard to the price point and so that’s what -- and that’s what we are focused on. Where we’ll go long term will depend a lot on we think both what we can do in terms of our supply chain and our design and where we think the customer value inflation is. But in the quarter the two points that you are referencing were more a result of product mix and alignment of positives that as I said in my script we don’t expect to recur.
David Lewis: Okay. Thank you very much.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. The next question in queue that will come from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Marshall, maybe just a continuation of the last question on margins. Can you give us just broad strokes kind of view the puts and the takes that we should be thinking of going forward even into next year on the margin side and then also the gross margin that is and then if you could just tell us or remind us how you guys view operating leverage materializing in the business model going forward?
Marshall Mohr: From a margin perspective there are a number of different influences. One is a product mix and the products the margins on I&A are greater than they are on systems. So to the extent that we have systems doing well or not doing well the network swing in the margin and also a geographic mix where we sell in the United States and dollars obviously we sell to our distributors at a discount to that we sell to in certain markets in foreign currencies and depending on foreign exchange that can have some impact on the amount of revenue that have. And then we have expanding opportunities at in our newer product, and those newer products happen to have lower margins. And so to the extent that we are successful in let’s say stapling and vessel sealing, it’s a positives for the company because you are taking greater share of wallet, but in terms of the gross margin percentage it will push down the gross margin percentage because the margins on those products are not as high as our mature products. So there is a number of different things that can affect gross margin. As far as leverage, we manage the company wisely. We try to improve margin, we have a number of programs like we said in place to reduce the cost of products, but we are also as Gary said, we are new in a lot of markets and we will expand, we will sacrifice a point of margin for expansion of market. The way we think about it is you have opportunities for scale and leverage in things like instruments and accessories to some degree and imaging and then mature procedures, the commercial part. But you have opportunities for investment and that’s in new products, cost reductions and new geographies. And we are balancing those two. So we think about both.
Richard Newitter: Great, and then just one last one. Si-e sales looked like they were zero this quarter, first time since, I think, you launched that product. Gary, can you just comment on what you are seeing in the marketplace as far as demand goes for the lower price point in the context of more complex and the systems like the Xi that you're launching and the steam that might be building behind that? What does this mean, if anything, for demand trends for Si-e or the lower -- the low end of the spectrum?
Gary Guthart: We are happy to provide the customer a system that meets their needs as to where they want to go and partly due to robotics programs. And I think the results speak for themselves. I think that Xi is being well adopted I think as we finish the product set and complete the product set that has made it more attractive to those who may be waiting for that completion. We still sell Si refurbs and Si-e and I think the difference between an Si-e and a four [ph] arm is value people I see -- I think that while there are a lot of procedures you can do through arm people really enjoy that or value that fourth arm and so you see fewer Si-es I think it’s simple as that.
Richard Newitter: Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Operator, we have time for just one more question here, please.
Operator: Thank you sir and that will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Vijay Kumar: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe one on the margins here. I know that you sort of mentioned mix right and when you think about mix you had a higher proportion of Xi and if I remember correctly on the last call you said Xi you are still scaling up margins was lower but Xi was higher, but then offsetting that you had a higher proportion of system sales coming in from the U.S. I’m just trying to think how those two trade off and how they benefit your gross margins?
Gary Guthart: Yes I think this quarter specifically we benefitted from the product mix and that there was a high proportion of the dual console Xi and when you look at the product cost side the extra surgeon console us the mature technology with the lower cost on that and then you get the extra price to run through margin. So that helped us out as Marshall said there were negligible inventory charges in the quarter and other costs, other charges to cost of sales were pretty minor. So lot of things lined up pretty well for us in the fourth quarter -- in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter we think it was probably a more typical pattern in terms of the product mix and some of the other costs and a seasonally stronger capital quarter we have more system sales those that carry a little margins than the recurring revenue side and we’ll have more definite comments about 16 on the next call.
Vijay Kumar: Great. And one follow up. Marshall, on that cap allocation sort of just wondering sort of what your priorities are and buyback was a little anaemic in the quarter. I was just wondering sort of what the moving parts were?
Marshall Mohr: Yes there is no change in our philosophy. We will continue to purchase shares when at the right opportunity. Keep in mind that the stock has been depressed over the last 30, 40 days and yet that’s a period in which we cannot be in the market because it’s a blackout period for the company. And so anyway we’ll continue that philosophy and you’ve seen us purchase, repurchase over $2.5 billion worth of stock over the last couple of years and we think at rare prices.
Vijay Kumar: That was helpful. Thanks guys.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Vijay. That was our last question. As we’ve said previously while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on helping surgeons increase patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. The following quote by Dr. Parekh, an experienced neurologist at the University of Miami sheds light on how our customers view our systems. The latest version of the da Vinci system Xi allows us to offer more minimally invasive surgical options to more patients. Hard-to-reach tumors or those encompassing more than one organ can potentially now be approached with this more agile and visually enhanced device. We’ve built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the volatility of things that truly make a difference. This concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support on the zest for ordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using the AT&Ts executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Quarter Two 2015 Earnings Release Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. Note that Patrick Clingan, who has participated on these calls in recent quarters, will not be with us on the call today due to minor illness. We expect him back in the office next week. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 5th, 2015, and 10-Q, filed on April 22nd, 2015. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com, on the audio archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second-quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights; Marshall will provide a review of our second-quarter financial results; then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2015. And finally we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us on the call today. In the quarter, growth in procedures was healthy, maintaining the rate of growth we experienced in the first quarter and showing solid performance in several specialties and geographies. Our capital performance improved in the quarter, as did our margins. Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the second quarter was just under 14% compared with Q2 of 2014. Utilization trends present last quarter continued, with strength in hernia repair, solid growth in colon and rectal resections, continued recovery in prostatectomy, and stable trends in hysterectomy. Growth in the use of our products was broad-based and included the U.S., Europe, and key markets in Asia. Procedures grew strongly in China, and growth was solid in Japan and Korea. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. Turning to capital sales, we placed 118 systems in the quarter compared to 96 in the second quarter of 2014. The United States and Japan accounted for most of the growth in system placements year-over-year. We see interest across our product line, from our multi-quadrant Xi system to our Si system, with customers choosing the system that best fits their program's needs. In Japan, clearance of the Xi system unlocked some system demand and we sold 13 systems in the quarter compared with five a year earlier. Procedure growth in Japan remains healthy, given the current state of reimbursement. As we've said on prior calls, the growth of the market in Japan will be paced by continued progress on reimbursement. Clinical investigators have submitted their partial nephrectomy data to MHLW for review, and ISI continues to work with key stakeholders in the reimbursement for additional procedures. We have no assurance of additional procedure reimbursement at this time. Turning to margins, our operating teams are focused on reducing product costs for our new products and we're managing our fixed expenses carefully. This quarter was a step in the right direction on gross margin, though an early one. We will continue to focus on improvements over the next several quarters. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call. In summary, our operating performance for the second quarter is as follows. Procedures grew just under 14% over the second quarter of last year. We placed 118 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 96 in the second quarter of 2014. Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $586 million, up 16% from the prior year, and up 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $297 million, up 13% over prior year. We generated pro forma operating profit of $228 million in the quarter compared with $196 million in the second quarter of 2014. And pro forma net income was $173 million compared to $140 million in Q2 of 2014. In product development, we are rounding out our Xi system offering by launching additional EndoWrist instruments, integrating table motion with Xi, and developing Single-Site for Xi. In Europe in the second quarter, surgeons have performed the first clinical cases using integrated table motion with Xi with enthusiastic feedback. We recently submitted our 510(k) for software that enables table motion with Xi. We anticipate filing our 510(k) for Xi Single-Site in the second half of the year. We have also broadened the roll-out of our white reload for our da Vinci Xi Stapler. Feedback on its utility has been positive. Additional Xi EndoWrist instruments have been released in the quarter, continuing to round out our instrument offering for Xi. For da Vinci Sp, our dedicated single point of entry architecture, development is progressing with system integration and laboratory testing in progress. Stepping back and looking at the business at the midway point of the year, we're focused on expanding the application of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; filling out our product line for da Vinci Xi and launching in key markets globally; developing our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; improving our gross margins; and advancing our technologies to improve surgery. I will now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review our financial performance.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. I will be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP, and investment impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We've posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. Pro forma second quarter revenue was $586 million, an increase of 16% compared with $507 million for the second quarter of 2014, and an increase of 10% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the second quarter of 2014 excludes net revenue associated with offers made in 2014 to trade out Si product for Xi product. All trade out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. Second quarter procedures of approximately 162,000 grew nearly 14% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and approximately 8% compared with the first quarter of 2015. Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma, instrument, and accessory revenue grew 13% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and increased 7% compared with the first quarter 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth and customer buying patterns, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,830 per procedure, approximately the same as the second quarter of 2014 and similar to the approximately $1,840 last quarter. Pro forma system revenue of $176 million increased 27% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and increased 25% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase compared with the first quarter primarily reflects increased unit sales. 118 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 96 systems in the second quarter of 2014, and 99 systems last quarter. 64% of the systems placed in the second quarter were Xis compared with 52% in the second quarter of 2014, and 76% in the first quarter of 2015. We sold more Sis in the quarter than the previous quarter, reflecting seven Si system sales under a contract with the Department of Defense, and eight Si system sales in Japan. We expect the mix of Xi to Si product to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Service revenue of $113 million increased 6% year-over-year and decreased $1 million compared with the first quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase reflects the increase in our installed base. The decrease compared with the first quarter reflects the timing of service contract renewals and changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our installed base. Globally, our system ASP of $1,500,000 was approximately the same as the second quarter of last year, and increased relative to the first quarter ASP of $1,480,000. Relative to the second quarter of 2014, higher ASPs were primarily associated with higher mix of Xis, offset by the impact of the strengthened dollar. The increase in ASPs relative to last quarter reflects geographic mix and lower trade-in activity. ASPs will fluctuate on a geographic and product mix, trade-in volume, and changes in foreign exchange rates. Hospitals financed approximately 21% of the systems placed in the second quarter, up from 14% last quarter. We directly financed 12 systems, of which five were structured as operating leases. Several customers bought out previously leased systems in the quarter. Although revenue associated with the buyouts are included in total revenue, we've excluded this revenue from the computation of system ASPs. We have also excluded these buyouts from the system placement number. In the U.S., we placed 72 systems in the second quarter, compared with 61 systems in the second quarter of 2014 and 63 systems in the first quarter of 2015. As previously noted, second quarter system placements in the U.S. included seven systems sold under our Department of Defense contract. In general, the increase in system placements relative to the prior year reflect growth in procedures and market acceptance of the Xi system. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows; second quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. of $168 million grew 25% compared with $135 million for the second quarter of 2014, and grew 12% compared with $150 million last quarter. The increase compared with the previous year reflects higher Japan system revenue, higher instrument and accessory revenue reflecting procedure growth, partially offset by foreign exchange. The increase compared with last quarter reflects higher Japan systems placements, geographic mix of system placements, and procedure growth. Outside the U.S., we placed 46 systems in the second quarter compared with 35 in the second quarter of 2014 and 36 systems last quarter. o-US system placements reflect 13 systems into Japan this quarter compared with five systems in the second quarter of 2014, and one last quarter. We obtained Xi approval in Japan in late March, and five of the systems sold this quarter were Xi systems. European system placements grew to 22 systems this quarter compared with 19 last year and 18 last quarter. We placed no systems into China this quarter compared with one in the second quarter of 2014 and eight last quarter. As we have indicated in the past, and consistent with our history, system placements in our o-US markets will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, pro forma gross margin in the second quarter of 2015 was 68% compared with 69.2% for the second quarter of 2014 and 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015. The decline in gross margins relative to the second quarter of 2014 is primarily attributable to foreign exchange and a higher mix of newer products, including Xi and stapling. The sequential improvement in gross margin is primarily attributable to the completion of activities that resulted in one-time charges in the first quarter and cost of sales efficiency gains. In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we have refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $7 million in each of the first and second quarters. These charges are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process. Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense, and amortization of purchased IP, increased 10% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and increased 4% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase of pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 29.8% for the second quarter of 2014 and 28.9% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 benefited from approximately $8 million, or the equivalent of $0.21 per share of discrete items, including the release of reserves specific to tax years where we recently completed audits. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and o-US income, and will not reflect a federal research and development credit, unless such credit is reinstated. Our pro forma net income was $173 million or $4.57 per share compared with $140 million or $3.73 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $512 million for the second quarter of 2014 and $532 million for the first quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015, compared with $104 million or $2.77 per share for the second quarter of 2014 and $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015.  We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.9 billion, up from $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated by operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buyback. During the quarter we repurchased approximately 100,000 shares for $49 million at an average purchase price of $494 per share. And with that I would like to turn it over to Calvin who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights and provide 2015 financial guidance.
Calvin Darling: Thanks Marshall. Let me begin with the review of our procedure results. As mentioned earlier, total second quarter year-over-year procedures grew just below 14% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 10% and international procedures growing approximately 27%. In the U.S. trends observed during the first quarter largely continued through the second quarter. In urology growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at a similar rate as the first quarter. We continue to believe that our Prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader U.S. prostate surgery market.  In U.S. gynecology, procedures were flat year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy, offset by declines in benign procedures. In recent quarters an increasing proportion of total hysterectomy procedures have been performed by gynecologic oncologists.  During the second quarter general surgery remained the primary contributor to U.S. growth. With robust growth in hernia repair and solid contribution from colorectal procedures, being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. During the first half of 2015, ventral and inguinal hernia repair contributed the majority of the increase in the U.S. general surgery procedures. The contribution to first half U.S. growth for mature procedures in highly penetrated markets such as da Vinci Prostatectomy and da Vinci malignant and complex hysterectomy has exceeded our expectations. In the second half of 2015 growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy is likely to slow as we anniversary into higher prior year growth rates. Looking aboard during the second quarter, international procedure growth was led by a modest acceleration in the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. During the first half of 2015 growth in international da Vinci Prostatectomy was approximately 20%. Let me take a few moments to provide a bit more color around China. Over the past year we've sold 20 systems under tenders from among 38 civilian hospitals authorized by the government’s required da Vinci system. Procedure adoption has been broad based in urologic, gynecologic, general and thoracic procedures. While we are encouraged by these developments, future system placements are dependent on completion of the Central purchasing tender under the current authorization which is said to expire at the end of 2015. It is not certain whether the tender process will be completed or when future governmental authorizations and approvals may enable system placements in 2016 and beyond. Procedure growth rates are likely to be governed by the timing of additional system placements.  Moving on to clinical and economic validation. A recent publication from Saarland University by Professor Stöckle and team evaluated the cost effectiveness of da Vinci Prostatectomy compared to open Prostatectomy from a German payor perspective in a 1,400 patient study, partially supported by Intuitive. From a clinical perspective the robotic patient population showed fewer positive surgical margins and required fewer intraoperative transfusions with the reduction in hospitalization of approximately six days. In the economic analysis the study showed that the robotic patients were roughly €3,000 per patient less expensive as measured by the period from date of surgery to two years post operation. The authors concluded that the improved clinical outcomes led to the reduction in post-operative cost.  In the quarter there was considerable interest in colorectal clinical data with the initial outcomes reported from the ROLARR study. In addition, several other notable studies were published during the quarter. Let me take a moment to highlight two studies from large scale state-wide general surgery registries published in Surgical Endoscopy. The first study was published by Dr. Cleary and team from Saint Joseph Mercy Health System in Michigan. After reviewing over 2,700 minimally invasive colorectal surgeries from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative registry, the authors found that conversion rates were lower with robotic compared to laparoscopic procedures for rectal resections and hospital length of stay were shorter with robotic procedures compared to conventional and hand assisted laparoscopic colon procedures. The second study was published by Dr. Altieri and colleagues from Stony Brook University in a broad based study of nearly 170,000 minimally invasive general surgeries from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System, the authors found that robotic assisted procedures had lower rates of complications and hospital length of stay compared to laparoscopy across several general surgeries, with the lower rate of complications for colectomies.  They concluded “robotic approaches may facilitate safer adoption of minimally invasive approaches in areas where penetrance of conventional laparoscopy is low such as in colorectal surgery.”  This concludes my procedures and clinical commentary I will not be providing you with our update financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures, on our last call we estimated full year 2015 procedure growth of 8% to 11% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. We are now increasing our procedure estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth within a range of 11% to 13%. Turning to gross profit, our outlook for gross profit margin has modestly improved compared to last quarter. We expect our second half 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 67% to 68% of revenue. Note that this range is a bit lower than our second quarter gross margin as Q2 benefited from favorable product and regional system mix and Q3 and Q4 will likely face stronger foreign exchange headwinds. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product and regional mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates.  Turning to operating expenses, consistent with our last call, we continue to expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses towards the lower end of a range of between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. We now expect our 2015 non-cash stock compensation expense to come in towards the lower end of the $170 million and $180 million range forecast on our last call. Fairly flat compared to $169 million in 2014. We expect other income, and just comprise mostly of interest income to total between $16 million and $18 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, for the reminder of the year we continue to expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pre-tax income depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will first go to line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.
Robert Hopkins: Hi, thanks. Can you hear me okay?
Gary Guthart: Can.
Marshall Mohr: Can.
Robert Hopkins: Congratulations on a good quarter. Wanted to ask two quick questions. First on the gross margin side, I appreciate the specific guidance for the near-term and the back half. But Gary and Marshall, I was wondering if I could just get your views on a little bit longer term. Because gross margin is definitely a major issue for investors as they consider your Company and the stock. So is the back-half level that you're talking about here, 67% to 68%, as you think about the long-term, is that a level that you view as sustainable when you think about all the different puts and takes? Would just love a comment on long-term gross margin. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: We don’t -- as we look at long-term, we don’t see huge changes form that range. There are lot of puts and takes that make it hard to call. So as we get scale along some of the newer products, we get some benefits in terms of cost and cost reduction. There are regional variances so there is mix changes in regions in terms of regional pricing. There are some things that will make it go up and down.  Longer term we will benefit from some cost advantages, but also depending on the changes in the marketplace and the scale of some of our customers, there are other pressures. So we think where we are today that's a pretty good number to think about.
Robert Hopkins: Okay. And then as a follow-up, two other quick things. You've said a -- it sounds like another good quarter on the hernia side. I was just wondering, now that we're a good, solid couple of quarters in, any kind of commentary from you on -- your views on the sustainability of hernia growth over time, now that you are learning a little bit more. And I also just wanted to understand the specifics around your comments on Sp, and when we should be thinking about a formal launch of that as we look forward.
Gary Guthart: Sure. So on the hernia side, as you mentioned we are seeing good early growth. I recognize that hernia is both more than one kind of procedure, abdominal hernia, or ventral hernia and inguinal hernia and even within those there is variations in both technique and patient population. So clearly right now there is a mixture of sustained use by our customers and people who are learning and trialing the technology. What that mix looks like in the near-term is actually very hard to determine. We do see some early evidence of strong clinical benefit in some of the categories and segments and we think that's long-term durable. Our calling right now how big those total available markets are going to be is still premature. So we have some basic estimates we are working them down. As the quarters go by here we will able to increase our certainty of what those long-terms look like. With regards to Sp, we are not predicting the ship date at this time. We are on track in our technical developments. We are in conversations with several surgeon groups as well as regulators about where both long-term value can be and what regulatory pathways are and as those firm up we will share them with you in the future.
Robert Hopkins: Great. But that’s still a 2016 event, right?
Gary Guthart: We have not anchored on when we are launching.
Robert Hopkins: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will move to line of Tao Levy with Wedbush.
Tao Levy: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. 
Gary Guthart: Hey, Tao. 
Tao Levy: Hi. So maybe the first question, we think about Japan and next April on the reimbursement and I know you mentioned that you've submitted sort of the kidney data to the regulatory authorities there recently. Are there any other clinical data that either required or that you’re going to be submitting between now and I guess reimbursement decision time?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. So technically, by the way, the submissions are done by the clinical investigators not by Intuitive. We don’t see another clinical data submission between now and April. On the other hand, the pathway that partial nephrectomy went through is something called [indiscernible] uro. That is not the only pathway that have a conversation with the government.  So the one dataset that we see going in at that time is partial nephrectomy. But there are other conversations ongoing that don’t necessarily have the same pathway. And with nothing has been assured, we can't anchor you on any particular pathway. But we are having multiple conversations.
Tao Levy: Okay, perfect. Just to reiterate that, just because there are no other studies, it doesn’t mean that you can potentially get reimbursement in other procedures. 
Gary Guthart: Right. There are other methods besides just this one. Right.
Calvin Darling : Yeah. We are not anchored on that April 2016 timeframe either. I mean these other methodologies could occur anytime. 
Tao Levy: Okay.
Gary Guthart: Having said that they are uncertain and they take real work and…
Tao Levy: I understand that. So, my next question, if you think of the instruments that you've recently gotten approved, some of the more advanced disposables -- whether it's stapling and you've got now on the Xi, the energy -- or I guess you had that last year. But as you think about penetration of the applicable type of procedures where those types of instruments are commonly used laparoscopically, what type of penetration should we be thinking about today?
Gary Guthart: So the stapling products that we have in the market today are primarily focused on colorectal surgery and we are seeing really nice adoption in that procedure. That's what they were designed for. Staplers are typically used in those procedures and the adoption of Intuitive’s product in that case has been good. So we've been pleased with that. Things like vessel sealing are used more broadly and so we see increasing penetration of our vessel sealer in a variety of procedures from general surgery to gynecology and others. So they’ve been good products for us. I think they are meeting customers’ needs and we've seen growth.
Tao Levy: But in terms of the percent of times that the surgeon would use an assistant port, for example, for a stapler or a sealer while doing a da Vinci procedure, are there any metrics around that that you've looked at?
Gary Guthart: So we do track how often they use ours. I don’t think we've gotten to a place of disclosing what the breakouts are for each of those subunits. 
Tao Levy: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. We will go to line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Gary, I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on some of the developments for the back half of the year, in particular, around the interoperable table motion for Xi. Just trying to understand does this open up more complex procedures. How do you think about the opportunity set? And then similarly with Single-Site for Xi, how do we think about the initial rollout?
Gary Guthart: Sure. With regard to table motion, just the value of it, why do it, the value of integrated intraoperative table is that it allows the surgeon to position the patient using gravity. It’s something that they do frequently. It also allows the anesthesiologist an easier interaction to help manage the patient.  And the power of the integration we've done with our partner has been that it allows it to be done quickly and efficiently. So it’s fast. So the real value here is to speed up procedures. It allows them to do it seamlessly. And so we don’t think it’s so much opening a different market as it is making it easier on lower barriers.  The feedback too, they’ve been now used in dozens of cases in Europe where it has CE Mark. Feedback has been really good and the implementation done by the team is very, very good. So that looks good and we are encouraged. We've submitted the 510 (k) just recently, answer FDA’s questions as they come and work through that. It really is rounding out. It’s one of the features that rounds out the Xi platform. Intraoperative table motion is a strong beneficiary for general surgery procedures where folks are wanting to move around the abdomen, helps a lot in that setting. And so the fact that they can do that dynamically is powerful. Turning to Single-Site on Xi, Single-Site is already available, of course, as you know on the Si. There is nothing that's a technological limitation from putting it on Xi. It’s really been doing the work and getting the clearances.  What that will enable is the mid-sized hospital that owns one platform; they may have an Si now. They are doing Single-Site and they want to upgrade to an Xi, that’s completes the set for them so that they don’t have to step away from something on their Si system when they move to Xi. And so that's really the opportunity for us there and we are meeting our technical milestones and working through the set of validations that will be required to get clearance. So we are excited about it.
Tycho Peterson: Great. All right. And then a question on ROLARR, now that we've seen the data, I'm just wondering how the discussions with surgeons has evolved. Has this opened up some doors for you, potentially showing equivalency with laparoscopic? And yes, just wondering how you are marketing that to your physician base.
Gary Guthart: The conversation has generally been positive. As you know ROLLAR is really studies a little subgroup, right? So the trial design is such that it’s comparing advanced laparoscopists, highly laparoscopists to new robotic surgeons in rectal cancer. What's not said in that study is that the dominant treatment modality in rectal cancer is open surgery. So to show good data upfront as they presented, showing equivalence and leading towards some potential benefits even in that early stage in the small subgroup that is minimally invasively treated today, I think that's generally been seen as a positive. And so I don’t think it’s been ground shaking in either direction. But I think it’s generally been well received by our customer base. 
Tycho Peterson: And then just last one going back to the original question on the margins, on Sp in particular, I think part of your reason -- the original delay occurred was to get the engineering right and the manufacturing right. Are you able to just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about the margin profile of Sp when it comes out? Shouldn't it be additive to the overall base you are talking about?
Gary Guthart: Yes, as we think about Sp and margins, in total really we're looking for those procedures where we can really show significant outcome value. And I think there are some really interesting potentials out there. Sp is a fundamentally different way to deliver the instrumentation relative to multiport. We have some experience in single port with Single-Site, but Sp allows us some different opportunities. That said it's a little more complicated. Now, the engineering side has done a great job. The engineering team in terms of getting both the cost structure and the performance where we want it has been very good. What we want to do is match that up with potential clinical outcomes that really are strong beneficiaries of our approach. That's really what the clinical side of work has been, and I'm feeling positive on it. I think that the design is really enabling.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew: Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. If you think about the improvement we've seen versus the earlier guidance, primarily coming from gross margin and I know, Gary, you guys have been investing aggressively in Europe and overseas for quite some time now. Can we see some of that taper, and see more of the upside flowing through the operating margin over the next year or two?
Gary Guthart: On the time horizon, it depends a lot on which part of the world you are in. I think that as we've talked about in Japan, we now have a direct team there starting to perform more effectively. I think as they're integrating, that looks really good. There are barriers and other things that have to be overcome structurally. And how quickly those resolve I think will determine the pace of the commercial business, and we've talked about it already; things like reimbursement. In Europe, I think we're seeing a nice performance in several countries. The barriers are a little bit different, depending on which country it is. Not every country is working at the same pace. But we're seeing some of the return on the investments in Europe, and we expect both better performance out of Europe in future quarters, and some continued investment.
Marshall Mohr: But I think you were headed towards -- is there additional leverage? And I think that although those are providing return, we'll continuously be investing in overseas markets. As we've characterized before, there's a really large opportunity out there and we have other things we have to get done.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then just a quick check the box question. The procedure guidance, is that consistent o-US, U.S., versus what we've seen year-to-date?
Calvin Darling: Yeah, I mean I think in the commentary on the call, we talked about the second quarter really being a continuation of the first quarter trends. And I think that when you talk about the second half of the year, we are talking about a continuation of what we saw in the first half, both domestically and internationally. And the variance in the range really has more to do with just the magnitude of those key drivers that we went through.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then last for me today, please. Gary, if you think about pocket share or revenue per procedure in usage and I know it's potentially variable with Sp, but how does that evolve over a three to five-year window? Because you've got vessel sealing, you've got the stapler; those are relatively underpenetrated versus where they could go. You've been running kind of flattish, even with some erosion in procedure potential, if you will, in the number of instruments. You're running flattish on revenue per case. Where does that go? Are you just hoping to hold it steady? Or do you see a lot of rich targets out there to grab additional pocket share?
Gary Guthart: I think in the mid-term, there will be some trades here of some efficiency gains realized by hospitals and some increased penetration of advanced instrumentation. I think in the longer term, the efficiency gains will find a bottom and the advanced instrumentation will continue to grow.
Calvin Darling: And I think you look at where Q2 came in terms of revenue per procedure, at the $1,830 level. About what we would've expected, consistent with the last quarter and the last year. But there were some trade-offs. I think foreign exchange hit us harder and we did have some benefit from the newer products that we've talked about that largely offset it, so, a lot of moving parts. As we look into the second half, we'd probably assume something similar we've seen in the first half on instrument accessory revenue per procedure. But to offset the exchange, you're probably going to have to have some favorability in other areas.
Ben Andrew: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.
Matt Taylor: HI, thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask about some of the drivers here that could lead to system sales. I know you don't give guidance there. But could you talk about the importance of the movable table, the instruments, and those other factors that you've talked about in driving the sales and whether you may see some sequential uptick over the next couple quarters?
Gary Guthart: Yeah, just speaking to the main levers here of system purchase decisions, there's really three levers that we've talked about and remain in place. One of them is upgrade. For a customer who has a system and is thinking about upgrading from an S or an Si or one of the prior systems, they are really looking out and saying, does Xi bring to them either outcome benefit or new service lines relative to prior products? That's where table motion and Single-Site can make a difference, particularly for single system hospitals. And so we think as those product lines fill out, that will help that upgrade pipeline. There are people who just buy purely on capacity. They have used the existing capacity of their system. As procedures grow, they look to do additional procedures; they will buy a second system or so. And the last one is really capacity, again, but often -- is it in the right place. If you are a larger institution or an integrated delivery network, you may be interested in moving the capacity to a different region or a different part of your service network. Sometimes they do that by moving systems; sometimes they do that by buying systems. So, capital decisions are really predicated on those three pillars.
Matt Taylor: Great, thanks. And one follow-up. Just you have a lot of kind of runway here in the general surgery arena. But we've heard other physicians talking about ENT and neuro and cardio. Can you talk about how you are looking beyond even the big opportunities here in general to other areas on the horizon?
Gary Guthart: We're always out scanning, really from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head, to think about where is current surgery difficult or outcomes suboptimal, and in a place where our kinds of technologies can make a difference. We're already participating in ENT with our Si product. We think Sp will have some real value to add in the ENT space over time. There are other things, of course, in our radars as we go. I think that thoracic surgery is something that's going to matter in the future and something that our kind of technology can make a difference in, in terms of things like lung cancer, mediastinal cancers and so on. And so we're looking at those things. And we have, of course, as you might imagine other things further out that as we get closer to commercialization we'll talk about.
Matt Taylor: Great. Thanks for the time.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
David Lewis: Hey good afternoon.
Gary Guthart: Hi David.
Matt Taylor: Gary, just two questions. The first is on procedures. The real improvement this quarter was international procedures, I think got better by 7% or so. Can you give us any additional color on where specifically that procedure growth is happening? And you had made this commentary last years about these reinvestments overseas. It certainly seems that those investments are paying off. So maybe just more color on where those investments are happening, and what specific regions the procedures are strong. And I had a quick follow-up.
Gary Guthart: Okay. Let me give Calvin the floor to just give a little color on the distribution of procedure growth and then we'll get back to it.
Calvin Darling: Yeah, I think it went a little beyond just international. I think on the U.S. side, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we really had stronger than anticipated performance in the more mature procedures in the United States; I think continued strong growth in prostatectomy procedures. And then in gynecology, I think we anticipated somewhat of a pullback relative to Q1 -- or relative to the prior year, with a tougher comp. And really we were able to maintain the same -- similar level in that mature category. So, I think those exceeded our expectations and were part of the reason to raise the guidance. And then, as you say, international was driving it. I think Europe was in general tracking to trends and meeting our performance. The majority of our above-expectation growth was in Asia; as I mentioned, most notably China. We also had a very strong quarter in Korea.
David Lewis: And then, Gary, just a question on -- I know you get persistent questions on use of the balance sheet. But you've said historically that one of the drivers for using the balance sheet obviously is valuation, but the other driver really was just business visibility. And certainly as evidenced by this quarter, business visibility has markedly improved. So, why not use of cash for buyback? Why was the buyback not bigger last quarter? And how are you thinking about -- what's not a better use your cash than buying back your own stock, just given the improvement in visibility? Thank you.
Marshall Mohr: Yeah, David, this is Marshall. We philosophically really haven't changed how we approach decisions around cash and utilization of cash or buybacks. And we do have an intention to return excess cash to shareholders through stock buybacks. But as you know, we've executed those opportunistically based on market valuations. The stock market and our stock specifically has been volatile over time. And it creates opportunities for us to purchase stock at favorable prices. And, in fact, if you go back over the last two and a half years, we've repurchased more than 2 million shares at an average price of under $420 a share. So, we're philosophically aligned with what you just said, and that's how we've executed it.
Gary Guthart: David, you said that visibility has improved. Performance certainly improved this quarter on the -- in terms of the how we manage our business and internally and procedures we have strong visibility; the procedures a little less so. But capital remains highly volatile, and just because of the way capital purchase cycles in different economies work.
Operator: Thank you. We'll move on to the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.
David Roman: Thank you and good evening everybody. I wanted just to start with maybe Gary -- you are giving us just some reflection about what has transpired over the past four quarters. Because as I look at your business, this quarter really seems to represent a coming together of a lot of the key drivers, whether it's system placements, procedure volumes, global expansion, et cetera. Whereas in the past few quarters we've seen some of these things I think move in your favor, but not all of them. So, is there anything that you saw change in the external environment over the course of the second quarter, or in your own business that really led to a positive coalescence of the key underlying fundamentals here?
Gary Guthart: I didn't see anything that looked really environmentally driven. As Calvin mentioned earlier -- I think moving with market trends tend to be things like prostatectomy and malignant hysterectomy, a little bit more mature, where those are probably more likely indicators of the total market behavior, rather than something specific to Intuitive. With regard to the major drivers that you've been talking about, really I think we've been working on them, in terms of new product launches, investments in Europe, investments in Asia, developing our team, and working on costs and margins. It's really been, roll up your sleeves and do the hard work. And we've had -- as you've said, some of those have come together a little earlier than others. I think one quarter is great. It doesn't make a trend, and our job is to keep doing it.
David Roman: Okay. And as you think about the go-forward from here and understandably I think it's clear why you're not giving total revenue guidance. But what are the factors that you think could lead you to a point to conclude that what you're seeing this quarter turns into a trend? I understand results would be one of those things. But if you look at factors that you monitor, are we at turning port where robotic surgery growth is back on track versus some of the challenges you've faced over the past couple of years? Or are there nagging factors that you think still need to be addressed?
Gary Guthart: I think there are always things to be worked on, and we've talked about several of them. I think with regard to visibility and predictability of the financials of the business, I think that's really, as I said before, predominantly predicated on capital. I think there are some interesting things going in the market. I do think that market acceptance of robotic surgery is increasing. I think some of the debates of where it adds value are starting to be resolved. We see a different tone in some of the surgical conversations more broadly and I think that's a real positive. So, we feel good about that. Having said that, I think that working through reimbursement pathways, working through regulatory pathways, and building really capable organizations takes time. And that's what we're focused on, and that will be the biggest predictor of our long-term performance.
David Roman: And maybe lastly, we've started to hear some discussion in the marketplace about potential competition for robotic surgery. Can you maybe just talk about either, A, what you're seeing; and, B, any actions that you're undertaking to position the business well should any new competitors potentially emerge in the next, call it, I don't know, six, 12, 18 months, et cetera?
Gary Guthart: We've been unwavering in our commitment to bringing value to surgery and our belief that we can. And, as such, we have really believed that increased competition is inevitable. It's validating in that it has other people putting their investments where they think it will bring value. And I think that actually increases the presence of robotic surgery in surgical societies and in the industry broadly. In terms of our competitive position, clearly we've anticipated the increase in competitors over the years and we've not been idle during that time. So, we've been thoughtful and have I think made some investments that will make our position long-term sustainable.
David Roman: Okay, great. Appreciate all that perspective.
Gary Guthart: Thank you. I think we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to line of Rich Newitter, Leerink Partners.
Ravi Misra: Hi, good afternoon, this is Ravi in for Rich. He's on the road today. Thank you for taking the question. Got a question on the Japan sales mix; more Sis than Xis. I understand it's early for the Xi launch, but curious as in terms of what you see it would take -- what you envision that it would take in Japan for Xi to inflect more quickly. And then another one, staying o-US; I think you made a comment a little bit earlier regarding China, where you see procedure growth rates sort of system placement driving growth seems to be a little bit of the opposite of the U.S., where procedures appear to be driving systems. At what point does the former turn into the latter? And any sort of -- I mean, are there certain number of systems or penetration that you look at when evaluating that opportunity? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I'll let Marshall take the first one on Japan, and I'll take the--
Marshall Mohr: Sure. So, in Japan what we said was that we had a split of eight Sis and five Xis. Now remember, Xi was just introduced -- or just approved, I should say, just approved in late March, so you've really had the opportunity to sell it in a three-month cycle. Selling cycles in Japan are much longer than that. In fact, they take multiple quarters to get systems done. That's why you see Sis getting done in the quarter, because the process for which the budget was established by the hospital and the purchase process takes a long time. And so this is just completion of deals that were already in flight months before this. And it will take time for Xi. And all of that should be caveated with the point that right now we have one reimbursement in terms of prostatectomy. We're hopeful to get other reimbursements. But until such time that occurs, system purchases are going to be spotty at best.
Gary Guthart: With regard to China, while we're pleased with the procedure growth and it has been strong, you're absolutely right, in early markets where there aren't a lot of systems placed, then system placements drive procedure growth. And in mature markets -- or more mature markets like the United States, where you have more capacity than procedure growth, turns around and drives the systems. You were asking, what's the pivot or the inflection point there? It really comes down to accessibility, vis-a-vis the patient population you are trying to treat. So, how many systems are in the neighborhood of the patients who can benefit from them? And so that's really how you have to back into it: start with the patient population that can benefit from them, and work your way backwards into systems. It's a regional model. We try to do that, but it's not always trivial because of data accessible.
Gary Guthart: Well, thank you. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on helping surgeons increase patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking to you again in three months.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Intuitive Surgical First Quarter Earnings Release Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will an opportunity for your questions, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Senior Director of Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical, Calvin Darling. Please go ahead, sir.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to Intuitive Surgical's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Director of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call maybe deemed to contain forward-looking statements [Audio Gap] including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 5, 2015. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at www.intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results. Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights. Then I'll provide our updated financial outlook for 2015. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us on the call today. In the first, we experienced solid growth in procedures, modest system sales growth and increase pressure on product margins. Starting with procedures, year-over-year growth in the first quarter was approximately 13%. Growth was led by general surgery, particularly hernia repair and colon and rectal resections. Early response by surgeons to the use of da Vinci and early datasets in these procedures are very encouraging. Urology also continued to show growth, maintaining growth rate seen in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year performance in gynecology grew modestly over Q1 of 2014. Procedure outperformance was broad based and included U.S., Europe and key markets in Asia. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. Looking at trends in capital sales for the year, we placed 99 systems in the quarter compared to 87 in the first quarter of 2014. da Vinci Xi continues to draw significant interest from our customers. Sales in Europe are historically lumpy and Q1 sales were lower than Q4 due primarily to seasonality. System placements and distributor markets were solid in the quarter. In Japan da Vinci Xi was cleared for sale at the end of Q1. We placed one Si system in Japan in Q1 as customers waited to evaluate Xi. We have remained focused on supporting Japanese customers and pursuing reimbursement and continue to make progress in daily collection and analysis. Turning to costs, margins decreased relative to prior quarters as a result of three main drivers. First, manufacturing cost as a percentage of revenue for our new system and advanced instruments remained higher than our more matured products. As these new products make up a greater percentage of our sales, our aggregated product margins have declined. Second, service costs for our Xi Imaging system have remained higher than we would like, as we work new technologies into our supply chain. We are addressing both manufacturing and service costs, and we will pursue the reduction diligently over the next several quarters. Finally the strength of the dollar was a negative in margins. In the first quarter, financial and operational hedges have offset some of the impact of exchange rates, although, we expect the impact of exchange rates to increase through the year. Marshall will take you through this and other financial performance in greater detail later in the call. In summary, our operating performance for the first quarter is as follows. Procedures grew 13% over the first quarter of last year. We placed 99 da Vinci Surgical Systems up from 87 in the first quarter of 2014. Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $532 million, up 9% from prior year and up 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased to $277 million, up 8% over prior year. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $185 million in the quarter compared with $189 million in the first quarter of 2014 and pro forma net income was $135 million compared to $139 in Q4 -- in Q1 of 2014. In product development, we are rounding out our Xi system offering by launching additional EndoWrist Instruments, developing Single-Site for our Xi system and integrating table motion on to the Xi platform. We expect to submit our 510(k) for software that enables table motion with our Xi system in the third quarter and the 510(k) for Xi Single-Site Instruments in the second half of the year. For da Vinci Sp, our dedicated single point of entry architecture, development remains on track with system integration and laboratory testing in process. I will now turn the call over to Marshall who will review our financial performance.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi training program, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP, and investment impairment. We are providing pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I'll also summarizer our GAAP results later in my script. We've posted reconciliation of our pro forma result to our GAAP results on our website. Pro forma first quarter revenue was $532 million, an increase of 9%, compared with $490 million for the first quarter of 2014, and down 11% from last quarter. On a constant currency basis, pro forma first quarter revenue increased 11% over the prior year. First quarter 2014 pro forma revenue includes revenue for systems where we subsequently offer a trade out -- to trade out Si product for Xi product. This trade out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. Revenue highlights are as follows, pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 8% compared with the first quarter of 2014 and declined 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth, partially offset by lower instrument and accessory revenue per procedure. The decrease from prior quarter primarily reflects procedure seasonality. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure, compared with $1,930 in the first quarter of 2014 and $1,820 last quarter. The decrease prior -- relative to the prior year reflects the impact of foreign exchange, lower Si Vessel Sealer generators and Firefly kits, lower instrument usage per case as surgeons become more efficient in their instrument usage, partially offset by increasing stocking orders. The increase relative to the previous quarter primarily reflects increase stocking order and customer buying pattern, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Pro forma system revenue of $141 million increased 9%, compared with the first quarter of 2014 and decreased 33% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase relative to the prior year reflects increase unit sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The decrease in systems revenue compared with the fourth quarter primarily reflects seasonality of system sales than lower system sales in Japan as customers’ anticipated Xi approval. 99 systems replaced in the first quarter compared with 87 systems in the first quarter of 2015 to 137 systems last quarter. 76% of the systems placed in the first quarter were Xi, compared with 71% in the fourth quarter. Xi was launched in April of 2014. Globally, our system ASP of $1,480,000 was approximately the same as the first quarter of last year and decreased relative to last quarter ASP of $1,550,000. Relative to the first quarter 2014, system ASPs were higher due to the introduction of Xi, which was offset by geographic mix, a higher Si trading credit mix in foreign exchange. The decrease in ASPs relative to last quarter reflects higher trading credits and foreign exchange, partially offset by an increased mix of Xi product, including Xi dual-consoles. Hospital financed approximately 14% of the systems placed in the first quarter, down from 15% last quarter. We directly financed 11 systems of which 9 were structured as operating leases. Through the first quarter of 2015, we've entered into 23 operating leases. In the U.S., we placed 63 systems in the first quarter, compared with 45 systems in the first quarter of 2014 and 71 systems in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase compared with the prior years reflects market acceptance of the Xi and procedure growth. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter reflects seasonality and system sales. Outside of the U.S., we placed 36 systems in the first quarter compared with 42 in the first quarter of 2014 and 66 systems last quarter. The reduction in year-over-year system placements includes a reduction in Japan system placement, one system this quarter compared with 19 systems last quarter as customers anticipated the Xi approval. We received Xi approval in Japan in late March. Europe systems placements grew from 14 systems in 2014 to $18 systems in the first quarter of 2015. We also placed eight systems in China this year, compared with zero in the first quarter of 2014. The reduction in systems placements relative to the prior quarter reflects seasonality. International revenue results were as follows. First quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. was $150 million, compared with $155 million for the first quarter of 2014 than $197 million last quarter. The decrease compared with the previous year reflects lower Japan system revenue of over $30 million and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher instrument and accessory revenue, reflecting procedure growth and higher system placements in the Europe and rest of world markets. Our lower sequential international revenue primarily reflects seasonality. Firs quarter 2015 o-US procedure volume was approximately 22% higher than the first quarter of 2014 and 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Procedure growth was led by DDP that also reflected strong growth in gynecology and general surgery. Before moving onto the remainder of the P&L, I’d like to outline the impact of the strengthening of the dollar has had on our results. We generally hedge a portion of our expected revenue for six months period at the beginning of January and July. In addition, we purchase system components from suppliers in euros and pay our sales force in local currencies, providing for national hedges. The pre-tax impact of currency movement, net of hedges relative to the fourth quarter was less than a $1 million. However, relative to the first quarter of 2014, currency movement had the impact of lowering our revenue to 9% versus 11% on a constant currency basis. Note that approximately 17% of our first quarter 2015 revenue was transacted in other than U.S. dollar, primarily in euro and yen. And natural hedges only partially offset the impact of currency movements on revenues. The impact of the past year’s currency changes will have a more pronounced impact going forward, particularly after our January as hedges expire in July. Moving to the remainder of the P&L, pro forma gross margins for the first quarter of 2015 was 65.6%, compared with 70.2% in the first quarter of 2014 and 67.1% for the fourth quarter of 2014. Our lower margin percentage relative to prior quarters primarily reflects a high mix of Xi systems, which have a lower margin than our mature Si products, as well as costs associated with our direct and scope recalls. New products like Xi and stapling have lower gross margins earlier in their life cycle than our mature products. We believe our efforts to reduce the cost of these products will begin to deliver limited improvements in our gross margins by the end of this year and greater improvement in fiscal 2016. The costs associated with the direct and scope recall, product recalls are not expected to continue. In the first quarter of 2014, we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated costs of settling a number of product liability legal claims under a tolling agreement. In the second and fourth quarters of 2014, we recorded another $15 million of charges reflecting additional claims. In the first quarter of 2015, we refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded $7 million of additional reserves. We will continue to refine our estimates as we proceed through the negotiation process. Pro forma operating expenses, which excludes the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchases IP were up 6%, compared with the first quarter of 2014 and were down 1% compared with last quarter. Our first quarter 2015 pro forma operating expense compared to the first quarter of 2014 reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.9%, compared with an effective tax rate of 27% for all of 2014. The pro forma effective tax rate for 2014 benefited from the release of reserves specific to tax years where we have completed our IRS audit or jurisdictions where statute of limitations has now expired. In addition, the 2014 rate benefited from the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of o-US and U.S. income and will not reflect a federal research and development credit unless such credit is reinstated. Our pro forma net income was $135 million or $3.57 per share, compared with $139 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2014 and $184 million or $4.92 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $532 million for the first quarter of 2015, compared with $465 million for the first quarter of 2014 and $605 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015, compared with $44 million and a $1.13 per share for the first quarter of 2014 and $147 million or $3.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.7 billion, up from $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercise, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased 30,000 shares for $15 million at an average price of $495 per share. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan: Thanks, Marshall. As mentioned earlier, total first quarter year-over-year procedures grew approximately 13%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 11% and international procedures growing approximately 22%. The meaningful uptick in U.S. procedure growth rates during the first quarter was largely due to a return to more normal Q4 to Q1 transition relative to what we experienced during the first quarter of 2014. U.S. da Vinci Prostatectomy procedure growth experienced in the second half of 2014 continued through the first half of 2015. Given our high rate of penetration in the U.S. prostatectomy market, our dVP volumes are likely to attract overall U.S. prostatectomy volumes, which had improved over the past three quarters. Kidney cancer procedures continued to be a solid contributor to our U.S. urology procedure growth during the first quarter. In U.S. gynecology, modest growth returned in Q1 led by benign and malignant hysterectomies. We believe that the modest increase in da Vinci benign hysterectomy volume during the first quarter has more to do with the return to normal seasonality than change in the trajectory of the total market for benign hysterectomies. We continue to believe that our procedure volumes are likely to attract to the overall benign hysterectomy market estimated to be declining at a low-single-digit rate. Despite high levels of da Vinci penetration for malignant hysterectomy, growth remains consistent with cancer procedures. Moving onto U.S. general surgery. Adoption continues to be solid across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal and hernia adoption remains a source of strength, while cholecystectomies continued to decline in the quarter. During the quarter, there were positive developments supporting the adoption of da Vinci surgery in colorectal resections and hernia repair. The colorectal resections, return of our Si Stapler and launch of our Si Stapler were positively received by surgeons. With our stapler, surgeons are reporting that the improved articulation and stability of the platform enables use deep in the pelvis for rectal resections while improved dexterity is supporting involving technique of intracorporeal anastomosis and right hemicolectomies. For hernia, the momentum behind adoption of da Vinci surgery and ventral and inguinal hernia repair continues to build. At the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons annual meeting and the Global Symposium on Robotic-assisted and Minimally Invasive Hernia Repair, surgeons shared case series that showed da Vinci surgery contributed to improve clinical outcomes within their practice and may serve as a tool to expand minimally invasive surgery to a larger population of patients. A number of surgeons have reported that the material operating costs associated with their da Vinci procedures is similar to the cost of laparoscopic procedures, as da Vinci technique enables substitution of high cost instruments such as tacks and balloons. Looking abroad, first quarter international procedure growth was approximately 22% continue to be led by global adoption of dVP and other urologic procedures with solid early contributions from gynecology and general surgery. In Asia, dVP adoption in Japan remained the source of strength in the first quarter. The clinical trial to support a reimbursement submission for partial nephrectomy completed enrollment and we continue to explore reimbursement pathways for additional procedures. In China, strong initial utilization of the systems sold in the second half of 2014 contributed to international procedure growth. In Europe, dVP adoption continues to be the primary driver of procedure growth in the first quarter with solid contributions from gynecologic oncology and colorectal procedures. During the quarter Dr. Ind and colleagues from The Royal Marsden hospital within the United Kingdom National Health Service published on the impact da Vinci surgery has had on the gynecologic oncology service in the Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery. In a study of 196 radical hysterectomies, the rate of laparotomy decreased from 60% pre da Vinci to 26% following the adoption of da Vinci surgery. Clinical outcomes improved as complications and blood loss were reduced and length of stay decreased by two days and average cost per patient decreased by about 1400 pounds or about 1200 pounds when system depreciation was modeled, though the author noted that the hospital’s existing system had capacity not being consumed by their urologists. In a detailed cost analysis, da Vinci surgery was found to be least the expensive method reported at 7900 pounds versus 12500 pounds growth in surgery and 10,000 pounds for laparoscopic surgery with the da Vinci surgery cost remaining low at 8500 pounds when model depreciation was included. This is also similar to papers from the U.S., Canada and Sweden that report clinical advantages and cost effectiveness of da Vinci surgery for gynecologic oncology. During the quarter there were several large scale database studies published supporting the role of da Vinci surgery. Two studies of interest pertains benign hysterectomy and partial nephrectomy. The first study used premier database at nearly 300,000 benign hysterectomies from 156 hospitals that adopted da Vinci following FDA clearance for gynecologic surgery in 2005. Published by Luciano and colleagues from the hospital of central Connecticut which supported from Intuitive. The study determined that the rate of minimal invasive surgery increased from 40% to 67% from 2005 to 2010. The increase of minimally invasive surgery came from both the adoption of da Vinci surgery and the expansion of laparoscopy. The profile of the da Vinci patient cohort was similar to the open cohort with higher comorbidities, larger uteri and a greater rate of morbid obesity than the laparoscopic and vaginal cohorts. Despite this more complex patient mix, da Vinci surgery experienced a lower complication rate than open, lap or vaginal procedure. This oral complication rate was also true during the initial 25 case series of a new adopting surgeon compared to mature rates of laparo open surgery. Conversion rates were also lower in da Vinci surgery arm compared to the laparoscopic arm. While the da Vinci procedures took longer than the other three modalities, experienced surgeons were able to achieve similar operative times to laparoscopy. There have been earlier studies published from the premier database that compared da Vinci surgery to laparoscopic procedures within the narrower patient population that is a minimal to laparoscopy, but this study showed da Vinci patient populations were closer in profile orphan surgery patients and that Vinci surgery improved clinical outcomes. The second study analyze the kidney cancer from within the Medicare surveillance, epidemiology and end results database to assess whether access to da Vinci systems enabled greater adherence to surgical society guidelines for partial nephrectomy and that clinical and economic da Vinci surgery has had on kidney cancer populations. A team of health economists led by Dr. Chandra from Harbor stuied over 27,000 kidney cancer patients treated with partial and total nephrectomies from 1995 to 2010 and published and help prepares. The office found the communities that had access to a da Vinci system were consistently more likely to have a higher rate partial nephrectomies compared to total nephrectomies and then those communities that did not have da Vinci system with an average 52% increase in the rate of partial nephrectomy penetration. Patients in this communities experienced lower rates of mortality and renal failure, These improved outcomes such as 5-year net benefit in quality adjusted life years of about $100,000 per patient. The author has concluded that the benefits of da Vinci surgery outweighed the cost by a ratio of 5:1 from a payer and patient perspective Intuitive provided financial support to the study. This concludes my remarks. And thank you for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures. On our last call we estimated full year 2015 procedures growth of 7% to 10% above the approximately 570,000 procedures performed in 2014. Now based upon continued strength in U.S. general surgery procedures, particularly hernia repair, favorable dVP macro trends and solid international procedure growth we are increasing our estimate for 2015. We now anticipate full year 2015 procedure growth within the range of 8% to 11%. Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2015 pro forma gross profit margin was 68.4% of revenue and at today’s exchange rate, we expect the stronger U.S. dollar will reduce gross profit by about 200 basis points for the year. Excluding this exchange impact, we anticipate our full year 2015 gross profit margin will be roughly flat with 2014 on a constant currency basis. We expect gross margin to increase by quarter in 2015 as the positive impacts of our product cost reductions take effect. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter to quarter depending largely upon product mix, systems production volume and foreign exchange rates. Turning to operating expenses. On our last call, we forecasted to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. We now expect to grow our operating expenses towards the lower end of this range. We now expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2015, compared to $180 million to $185 million forecasted on our last call and $169 million in 2014. We continue to expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $14 million and $16 million in 2015. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income depending primarily upon the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Go ahead, please.
Tycho Peterson: Thanks guys. I just want to start with your view on sustainability of some of the trends you are seeing in hernia. How much do you think is trailing right now if you kind of go back and compare in contrast to early experience with coli. How do you think about the trajectory going forward on hernia specifically?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Thanks for the question. As I look at ventral hernia, I think that you are seeing pretty nice response, the early response from surgeons and the data looks, looks quite good. I think long term there that’s moving in a positive direction for us, how big that total market is, still little bit hard to estimate. But the early returns there look like surgeons are finding value pretty quickly. When you look at inguinal hernia, there are some sub segments in that. And so that one -- that picture is little more complicated or little more nuanced. There are clearly some cases that are more complex even because the disease is more advanced or because the patient has comorbidities in which da Vinci really is delivering value. We’re getting a lot of great feedback and there are some other procedures that are little simpler and a little different where it’s used maybe a little bit more optional. I think we’re going to have to let that play out. So I think on the renal side, there is clearly a segment that matters and there are some other segments that maybe less so and we won’t know for sure until we see few quarters pass.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then as follow-up, since it is the first call, since we saw the United policy. Can you maybe just talk around preauthorization and what your discussions with docs are like and how you see that playing out both with United and other private payers?
Gary Guthart: Really speaking to the -- too soon to make any commentary really in the second quarters. Speaking to the first quarter, it really -- that said of preauthorizations and conversation is the continuation of a trend. We didn’t feel the nature of those conversations really change with our customers. We are attracting it in Q2 and that’s something that we can give you more detail on our next call.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then just one last one on dVP, are you seeing any kind of bounce back around watchful waiting as some of the older patients drop out?
Gary Guthart: One of the underlying drivers we think for return of some strength in dVP. In the U.S. is that we’re seeing some patients come back into surgical options as falling out of watchful waiting. And you see some patients being diagnosed later as a result of less PSA screening. So it’s little bit of both of those things, I think, are contributing to growth. You’ve seen that stability now for a few quarters in a row. It seems to be evident.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Go ahead please.
Bob Hopkins: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask a financial question of Marshall on the gross margin side because there are more of the things that stuck out to me in the quarter. I think in the last quarterly call, you suggested that the gross margin for 2015 excluding stock option would be kind of similar to the low 67 levels that you saw exiting 2014. And I know you gave some updated guidance here but I was just curious if you could talk about for 2015, what’s your new guidance implies relative to the old guidance of the low 67s for the full year?
Marshall Mohr: So to be clear, going from last quarter, you’re right, it was at 67.1 and this quarter we undershot that debt. Couple of factors there, one is foreign exchange changed since the time that we gave our original estimates back in January and that has a negative impact on us. Second thing is as we had some -- in the quarter we had some higher mix of Xi systems. And in Xi systems as we’ve said before it has lower margins than our Si systems. And then finally we had some of the product recall costs that we don’t expect to continue but they reduced our margin this quarter. As we go forward into the year, what our guidance is really predicting is that we are working hard towards reduction of cost associated with our newer products. And it will start to see some benefit from that. Having said that, it takes time and the majority of the benefit from those efforts will really be realized in 2016.
Patrick Clingan: And just kind of running through the guidance one more time, Bob. So we kind of took a look at the full year 2014 gross profit margin on a pro forma basis, it was 68.4%. Now when you kind of look at the exchange impact at today’s exchange rate, we think impact is roughly 200 basis points. It gets you back to a constant currency scenario. So excluding that, you get something like 66.4 as the full year rate as Marshall mentioned making improvements by quarter as the year goes on as we are implementing some of these cost reduction improvements.
Bob Hopkins: Okay. All right. So for the full year, you think you’d be somewhere around that 66.4 roughly. On the manufacturing cost for Xi, originally when you launched it, you told us it was lower margin product but then you said overtime you saw that the margin on Xi could get up and approach some of the Si levels. I’m just wondering if you can update us on how long you think that will take and then lastly for me is I was just wondering here if you can comment on different subject which is just your confidence in reimbursement for Japan in 2016. Any updates there would be appreciated? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Going back to the comments on Xi, what we’ve said in the past is that our margins on our newer products and we typically talked about Xi stapling and vessel sealing, we’re lower in -- we'll be lower in the early stages of introduction and that will work to reduce those cost every time. We have always provided the caveat that it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get to the same level as our mature products. They are highly complex products. And so -- and they have added features to them. And so we never committed that we would get back there. Having said that, I think that they had room to improve from where we are and we are working hard on those improvements.
Marshall Mohr: That’s right. Just turning to Japan, we continue to be in full conversation with multiple parties in Japan and supporting them as they pursue reimbursement. We’re generally pleased with the direction that the conversations are taking. We have not received assurance from the surgical societies or from the government that those methods will produce reimbursements in the 2016 timeframe, so that remains uncertain. Having said that I think, the work that’s been done in the pace of work been done is appropriate. And we feel like we’re doing the right thing.
Bob Hopkins: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ben Andrew: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Few things, first off, Gary, talk a little bit about your confidence and the procedure growth? And what dynamics push you towards the higher end of the newly raised range?
Gary Guthart: So you’re asking a kind of hypothetically what would we see happen that would move it toward the top end?
Ben Andrew: Yes.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. So I think, we’re seeing strengthened in the U.S. general surgeries. So we would expect that to continue to strength there is centered on hernia and colorectal. Colorectal recessions, the data looks really good. There is a lot of data that started to come out. We expect that that will be a big risk conversation but the early results we’re seeing particularly as a result -- as it relates to the large population of patients were getting open surgeries looks great. I think that hernia would continue on its growth rate. It’s on the fast growth rate. I think as surgeons find value as those publications come out. I think that would support the higher end. Urology has had some macro environment positives but we would have to see those continue to be at the high end. And then gynecology has stabilized in this quarter. Although we think as Patrick has described in his prepared remarks that hysterectomy, the fundamentals around hysterectomy are likely staying about the same environment and we think that we’re really just looking at Q1 over Q1 changes here. So to be on the high end, I think you have to see positive support there and a stabilization of the coli business. And just to kind to add -- sorry Ben, to add the other end of it, what would be the assumptions to get to the low end? Probably you would be assuming a higher degree of payer push back on some of the benign gynecologic procedures.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then Gary, just one other thing extending out there, what do you think the bottleneck is in general surgery penetration right now, is it Xi availability? Is its surgeon kind of training? And obviously, working hard on both of those but what do you think the bottle neck is?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I don’t think its so much of product availability problem. I think it’s you can do a lot of certainly the introductory work on Si systems. For sure, Xi makes a difference in much quadrant and so that’s something we’re working on. Part of it is excess to training although I think honestly more of it is going to be surgeon education, surgeon interacting with their peers and looking at the data and the potential benefits. So some of its just pure adoption dynamics, peer to peer interaction.
Ben Andrew: Okay. Great. And then maybe a quick one for Marshall, you gave us some good insights on the gross margin trajectory. Where do you think you exit ‘15 on a gross margin standpoint excluding currency impacts? Thank you.
Marshall Mohr: So I think, Calvin has given you a sort of the expectation for the year. And of course, given the commentary around that we believe that will be able to reduce cost as I expect that the latter part of the year will be better than the earlier part of the year.
Ben Andrew: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Chris Hammond: Hey guys. It’s actually Chris Hammond in for David here. Thank you for taking the questions. So my first question, I wanted to circle back to the gross margin conversation. And I understand that there are a number of puts and takes in the quarter whether that’s FX or recall cost and et cetera. But I was hoping that we could just kind of take a step back and talk about what your assessment is of the long-term trajectory for the gross margin of the business is. And primarily, I think that at least in my view, the biggest lever is probably around the ASP, both on instruments and for the systems. If I look at this over several years, they tend to be declining. And the argument that Xi is a greater percentage of mix. That seems to be the way of the future I guess, in where systems are going. So I just don’t understand how we can get back to where that all run rate was and any more color there will be very helpful?
Gary Guthart: So when you talk about the old run rate, I’m not sure which period you’re speaking about. I think that as we go forward, -- again not to sound like a broker record. But we’ll continue to look on cost associated with the newer products. I think that there are numerous dynamics on a long-term basis. So we haven’t put out any guidance beyond this year. And the numerous dynamics include over time. We’ll see some pressure on capital. We’ll defend what we have in terms of instrument and accessory and recurring revenue margins. We will and we’ll -- as we expand into products like stapling and vessel sealing will be taken a greater share of the overall wallet but likely at a lower margin. So there is things going for us and then they are saying several push back on it.
Chris Hammond: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just on the o-US side, I know there you talked about customers waiting in Japan ahead of the exciting approval but now that we’re moving past there. Is there any incremental call that you could talk about and what the customer reaction has been so far? Is there a more trailing period that has to go on or demo period that would make a more meaningful uptick in Japan, to be pushed out till little later in the year. Is that something that we might could expect in the second quarter?
Gary Guthart: The two dynamics going on with regard to the capital side in Japan. One of them is folks really coming into valuate Xi. The -- that's not in hospital that’s looking at the product and understanding its differences vis-à-vis Si. Now that’s happening now, the interest in it is quite high. What that looks like in terms of translating that interest into sales, we’ll see in the quarters. Our longer term in terms of building new programs, that really is going to be dependent on the reimbursement conversations that we’ve been having in this call and prior calls. 
Chris Hammond: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.
David Lewis: Good afternoon.
Gary Guthart: Hi, David.
David Lewis: Gary, just a couple of questions here. I guess, first off, on hiring. Looks like the hiring in this particular quarter was the strongest we’ve seen or the highest we’ve seen in two years. I wonder if you just could, A, if that’s accurate, but it’s not accurate, how should that we know that would be an embarrassing question? But just in terms of where the hiring is happening? Is this U.S. hiring? Is this OUS hiring? And specifically, if it’s U.S. which particular procedures is this hiring going to support?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Just functionally, where the adds remain, you’re right, it was 140 new employees added. We added in the quarter with 3,118 employees. I think majority of the add this quarter were in the product operations area, specifically in manufacturing, product developments and quality groups, and secondarily continuing to invest in our international organizations, including Japan and to a much lesser extent the U.S. commercial side.
David Lewis: Okay. Very helpful. And then, another question, I think, I asked a couple of quarter go was about the broader capital environments. I think the question in was based on what we’re seeing U.S. versus OUS. Have you reached the point where it’s more obvious that future capital growth or net placement growth is going to come outside the U.S. versus U.S. I think at the time, I think, Gary mentioned, it wasn’t clear, where we see -- as you take this four or two quarters and a couple of things this quarter, is it now beginning to become clear that net placement growth is really going to be materially driven outside the U.S. versus the U.S.? And this particular quarter, that placement growth was a little lighter. And was that just simply driven by Japan and China, specifically, was there any particular region you could call out that would explain the net placement differentials, so those two pieces would be great if you give some color on? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yeah. On the capital side, I think, there are a couple of things in the quarter that were a little more specific to us. On the U.S. side we see hospital systems, particularly corporate ownership optimizing their capital portfolio, it actually makes perfect sense. And so what they are doing is looking at where they want their systems both within hospitals and between hospitals that they own. We support them in doing that. And that’s, I think, will drive capacity consumption. And so on those bigger customers, they are doing that and we see that, that's not new for the quarter we’ve seen that for the last few, but I expect that trend to continue. For sure you saw a difference in Japan. I think a year ago in Japan, Marshall, the number was 19 down to 1. So that has to do with the things we had talked about prior about Japan both reimbursement and timing of Xi. I think that's the real question becomes, the answer of your question is going to come down to available capacity on systems and existing customers. How hard can they push capacity utilization before they need additional systems. We have a pretty good read on that for single hospitals. What changes the dynamic is our corporate-owned hospital groups, where they are willing to either move doctors, move patients or move systems to get higher utilization and that part is not yet clear where that will settle.
David Lewis: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Go ahead please.
Tao Levy: Great. Thanks. So quick question on the gross margin side, so you, I understand you brought in-house some manufacturing that you were outsourcing before? Does that -- did they have any impact -- sort of a negative near-term impact on the Xi manufacturing costs and you expect that to improve as you get better experience at some of that?
Gary Guthart: What, a couple of things there, one is, we’ve periodically both in-source and outsourced, I wouldn’t tag one particular thing as the general trend here. In terms of Xi cost reductions, the work that we are doing tends to be a fair number of little things. It’s not a one big activity that does the trick. It’s really optimizing both component manufacturing, looking at manufacturing yields in various parts of the line and working with suppliers who have better processes. So it’s a lot of little work and I wouldn’t tag it to one thing in particular. On the service side, some of it is really getting to utilization of our products and what service costs are both in terms of building out the field replaceable units in the field, so there’s some investments to make that happen, as well as optimizing kind of the ruggedness of some products in some environments. And so we are -- those -- that's the main focus on that product side. As Marshall said, we expect the instruments and accessory side to recover our margin quickly. We think the system side will be a little slower.
Tao Levy: Okay. And sort of on the hysterectomy front, any update on the uptake of Single-Site hysterectomy with the wristed articulation and also just to tag onto that and you said, year-over-year the comps were easy in hysterectomy? What about quarter-over-quarter anything there like might give you some comfort that hysterectomy might be a little bit better than you alluding to?
Marshall Mohr: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Tao. When you look at the Single-Site it's been the Wristed Needle Driver has been well received by the gynecologic surgery community. Reinstalling a risk on the single site platform enables them to do more of the reconstruction that they used to when they do a lot for da Vinci hysterectomy. So it’s been more received, it’s still early days and we’ll see where it goes from here, specific to -- sorry what was your other question?
Tao Levy: Looking at hysterectomy quarter-over-quarter instead of year-over-year with the comps?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. I think when you look at GYN space and some of the other benign procedures, this quarter looked a lot more like traditional Q4 to Q1 transitions relative to what we experienced in 2014.
Tao Levy: Okay. Great. And then just lastly, any reason why you're seeing lower Vessel Sealer usage, I would’ve assumed that would have gone up?
Gary Guthart: Just a point of clarity -- Calvin go ahead.
Calvin Darling: No. I think in general, we are seeing increased Vessel Sealer utilization in the field. What you're seeing less of there is initial orders of the Vessel Sealers and the generator products that are part of that initial sale. A bolus of hospitals had now made those investments and that had run through our accessory line. Also the -- that's right.
Gary Guthart: The generator is integrated into the Xi, so they have to do separate purchase.
Tao Levy: Okay. Perfect. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Larry Keusch: Good afternoon. Thanks. Garry or any of the team, I am wondering if you could speak a little bit to call as you -- you did indicate that that again you saw those procedures decline. I think in the past you sort of talked about surgeons making decisions on what procedures should be done in as coli falls to the bottom when you are looking at other general surgical procedures. So just wanted to see if you got any further insights into why that procedures set appears to be declining?
Gary Guthart: I think our commentary is similar to what we had talked about last quarter. Given the choice for competitive block time on one of our systems, if they can trade it off between a hernia procedure or colorectal procedure or prostatectomy, quality tends to be a lower priority. We see surgeons and patients who are delighted with the results and who are committed to it. And we see some folks who -- if they have a barrier else we’ll switch to a different approach and if there is a barrier having to do with machine access or so there is barrier with OR times or other approaches. So how big that market ultimately is and what it does as capacity settles out with remains to be same.
Larry Keusch: Okay. But you are not seeing any specific issues with the procedure itself, I take it?
Gary Guthart: No, we haven’t seen anything that would indicate that clinically there is something going on and that's changing folks’ view.
Larry Keusch: Okay. And then I am wondering Gary if you could talk a little bit about China, which is just a market that you started to speak to in the last couple quarters. Maybe help us understand sort of where we are within that market, what needs to happen to further develop it and maybe how we should think about the potential adoption of this technology over there?
Gary Guthart: Sure. Clearly, we are in early innings here in China. The response we are seeing both in terms of capital and then the utilization really has to do with the release of a government quota a few quarters ago and now the replacement of those systems is there meeting that quota. Capital sales are still paced in terms of the civilian market through a quote system and so that’ll be a limiting step on growth over time. Having said that once they are placed the utilization is coming up and the level of excitement and interest on the part of surgeons is high. We are currently partnered with the distributor in China. I think that as we look at long-term and years not quarters, clearly there is an opportunity there. And there will be some build-out of organizational strength required on both sides for that market to really reach its full potential and it’s something of course that we’re thinking about.
Larry Keusch: And then lastly there for Marshall or Calvin, Calvin, in your guidance you indicated on operating expense. If I got this correctly that you now anticipate those expenses to grow at the lower end of the 7% to 10% range. It wasn’t clear to me why those expenses now are anticipated to go slower than they had been a quarter ago.
Calvin Darling: Yes. I mean, there is certain element of timing in terms of new hires and programs. But I think it really the exchange impact that we’ve been talking about in terms of its impact on revenue and margin as an effect of reducing the expenses in U.S. dollar terms and it’s largely that that you’re seeing.
Larry Keusch: But no holding back on number?
Calvin Darling: No.
Larry Keusch: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Imron Zafar with Jefferies. Go ahead please.
Imron Zafar: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about where penetrations stands in some of the developed market like Western Europe and maybe Korea, in dVP. And I guess also dVH just in terms of where penetration is and what the -- how much runways lies ahead in terms of growth opportunity going forward?
Gary Guthart: We think about as you look out at Europe, take it country by country, generally we’re at healthy penetration but below half in most of the big markets in Europe. So Germany, Italy, France are probably highest in Nordics and then in U.K. So we think there is a significant room both in dVP and partial nephrectomy. Hysterectomy will really be anchored on hysterectomy for malignant conditions. I think we’re just in the beginnings of hysterectomy for malignant conditions in Europe. We are seeing some nice really uptake and some nice really work, but you’re probably still on single digits for the most part.
Marshall Mohr: And like the Nordic countries and growing quickly in the U.K.?
Gary Guthart: Korea is a similar I think picture. dVP again in the double digits probably not quite half, and likewise really early days in dVH for malignant conditions or partial nephrectomy in between those two.
Calvin Darling: Yeah. And one thing that was interesting, Imron. Last year for 2014, we did about 60,000 prostatectomies in the United States. If you look at the international market all-in, it was 65,000 with a lot of room to grow as was described.
Imron Zafar: And then lastly, I was wondering if you had any more updates on the Sp in terms of timing, where you are vis-à-vis instrumentation and things like that?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. So we recall -- we are working through two things. One is making computational platform and the software compatible with Xi and we are on track doing that. And the second thing is being getting the supply chain and costs in line for the instrumentation on the technical side and that’s also on track. As those things come together then we start doing laboratory testing, some in-house customer evaluation and the beginnings of laboratory testing and the building of those dossiers, which is really what’s set for the back half of the year. So far, we are pleased with where we are.
Imron Zafar: Okay. And not to beat the gross margin, that was even more but the Sp launch plan that is all factored into your commentary about potential improvement gross margin next year?
Gary Guthart: We haven’t tagged a launch date on Sp, nor we tag pricing yet. So we’re really -- the commentary is really ex-Sp without income.
Imron Zafar: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Swann. Go ahead, please.
Richard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just to follow-up on that last question on the gross margin in Sp. When Sp does actually come to market, is that something where we should maybe expect kind of an incremental gross margin drag and so you get up to kind of economies of scale on that?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. Generally speaking, just sort of some context on system gross margins, this systems when they come out relative to industrial products are very low volume compared to anything you used to in your day-to-day life compare to cars or cell phones or anything like that. These are really low volumes. So part of the reason that you go through the process of optimization over a couple of years is that it takes that long to get through the volume. The volume changes that you need to make and also to do some of the manufacturing optimization. It’s not possible to do it on variable volumes at a time. So it is generally expected that you’ll have a margin hit, when one of the new pieces of capital come in. And so we would expect some now. We’ll manage that both with the work, pre-work we do and how we price when Sp comes out but a little premature for that in the forecast.
Richard Newitter: Okay. And then just one more on gross margin. You’re saying, all else equal, improvement in 2016, is that improvement off of the 2015 level that you kind of alluded to in that 66.4% range, is that the right kind of benchmark to think of improvement also?
Gary Guthart: Yes. That’s exactly what the guidance was.
Richard Newitter: Okay. Thank you. And then Gary just one last one. Now that we are a few quarters into the Xi launch, I was just wondering where you are seeing Xi being used in the field, are you surprised by kind of the types of procedure that’s being used in? Or is there anything worth calling out or telling us with respect to kind of where it’s been used and maybe when expected to be used in? Are certain types of physicians gravitating towards it for the certain types of procedure?
Gary Guthart: In the places that we designed it for, I think we are really feeling like it’s meeting our expectations. It looks really good. Our multi-quadrant surgery, colorectal surgery -- we expected it to set up really well for thoracic surgery and it is. If we’ve been surprised, it’s being positive surprises. We’ve seen urologists appreciate what it can do. Folks doing ventral hernia find the flexibility of its setup is helpful for them. And GYN oncologists find the range of motion helpful. So that has been a pleasant surprise is their interest in using it and the benefit that it brings them. Well, thank you. That was our last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during this conference call, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma through products that our surgeons use. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at www.intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results. Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights. Then I'll provide our financial outlook for 2015. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart : Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2014 has been a year of transition for Intuitive with macro economic uncertainty at the start of the year giving way to improving performance as the year progressed. At the outset, we focused on driving adoption of our platform in general surgery. And launching key new products and in increasing our organizational capability and performance in international markets, particularly Europe and Japan. The organization has responded well in the year with solid procedure performance and a strong launch of our newest generation da Vinci platform. General surgery and international procedures has become the growth engine for the business.  Starting with review of procedures. Year-over-year growth was approximately 9%, led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci outside of the United States and the strengthening urology offset by flat annual performance in gynecology. General surgery growth was approximately 33% for the year comprised of strong growth in da Vinci colorectal surgery, hernia repair and in other general surgery procedures offset by slowing da Vinci Single Site use in cholecystectomy. While Single Site cholecystectomy procedures were up in 2014, they were down in the fourth quarter.  Outside of the United States, procedure growth remains robust, rising approximately 20% over procedures in 2013 based on strength in Europe and Asia. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. Looking at trends in capital sales for the year, capital placements increase in sequential quarters, helped by the launch of da Vinci Xi in the second quarter of 2014. Outside of the United States, our capital business was solid with international system strength in Europe and Asia outside of Japan. System sales weakened in Japan over 2013 as customers wait for both Xi clearance and additional reimbursement. Sales elsewhere particularly China grew over 2013.  Our product launches were significant in 2014. In the second quarter, we launched our fourth generation platform in da Vinci Xi surgical system. We launched Xi in the United States in April followed by CE Mark in June, availability in France, Austria and Switzerland in October and Korea in December. The Xi system enhances our product generation systems by improving multi- quadrant access to the body, introducing the ability to move the endoscope between robotic arms, increasing range of motion and reach with slimmer arms and enhancing ease of use and setup. Customer reception of the Xi has been strong with interest in use by multiple specialties including colorectal surgeons, urologists, thoracic surgeons and gynecologic oncologists. Our systems are optimized for different procedures by dozens of instruments and accessories. In 2014, we added to the initial set of instruments and accessories available for the Xi at launch by introducing the Xi Vessel Sealer Q2, Xi Firefly in Q3 and Xi Stapler in Q1 of 2015. In 2015, we plan to submit a 510 (k) for software that allows for coordinated table motion with the Xi and 510 (k) for a Xi compatible version of our Single Site instrument. This filling out of the Xi product suite will increase the applicability of the platform to institutions interested in owning a single da Vinci system.  Turning to instruments. We launched our Wristed Needle Driver instrument for use with Single Site surgery in Q4 of 2014. Surgeons performing single incision hysterectomy with da Vinci Single Site is particularly interested in the Wristed Needle Driver and initial uptick has been strong. Single site hysterectomy with Wristed Needle Driver is still in its early days and projecting its long-term impact on the hysterectomy market is premature. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we issued a field action for our da Vinci Xi Si Stapler that for we observed three intraoperative instrument failures. In each case these procedures were completed successfully minimally invasively. Our team has identified the root causes of failure and has requalified the stapler. As of this first quarter of 2015, the Si end of the stapler is back in production, and first case has been completed. Our Xi Stapler was also launched in the quarter with first case is completed this month.  Looking back at the full year 2014, our operating performance was as follows. Worldwide procedures grew approximately 9%. We shipped 431surgical systems in the year, down from 546 in 2013. Total revenue was $2.1 billion, down 6% from 2013. Recurring revenue grew to $1.57 billion, up 5% and comprising 70% of total revenue. We generated $819 million in operating profit before non cash stock option expense, down 21% from last year. Pro forma net income was $607 million, down 24% from 2013. And we reduced our shares outstanding by repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average price of $398 per share during 2014.  Turning to operating performance in the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 10% over the fourth quarter of last year. We sold 137 da Vinci Surgical Systems, down from 138 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Total revenue for the quarter was $605 million, up 5% from prior year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $281 million, up 5%. We generated an operating profit of $237 million in the quarter before non cash of stock compensation expense, down 8% from the fourth quarter of last year and pro forma net income was $184 million, down 5% from Q4 of 2013. In 2014, we made significant investments in our organization including growing our direct commercialization in Japan. We anticipate growing our organization in specific areas through 2015 with particular emphasis on Asia, Europe and in operations. Looking to 2015, our priorities are as follows. First, we will focus on the expanded use of da Vinci in general surgery particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair. Second, we'll work to complete our launch and new product introduction of da Vinci Xi in key markets globally. Third, we will develop our organizational capabilities and markets in Europe and Asia. And finally, we plan to build Xi compatible Da Vinci SP prototypes and initiate customer valuations. I'll now turn the call over to Marshall who will take you through our financial highlights. 
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our first quarter 2014 revenue in procedures were consistent with our press release issued on January 13. Fourth quarter revenues were $605 million, up 5% compared with $576 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, and up 10% from last quarter. Procedures for the fourth quarter grew approximately 10% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, and approximately 9% compared with last quarter. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi training program, legal claim accruals, stock based compensation, amortization of purchased IP, and investment impairment. We are providing pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I'll also summarizer our GAAP results later in my script. We've posted reconciliation of our pro forma result to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion. Procedure highlights will be covered Patrick. Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue grew 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 and 3% compared with the third quarter of 2014. The increase is relative to prior quarter reflect procedure growth, partially offset by customer buying pattern and the impact of the field action for our da Vinci Si Stapler. We've resolved the issue underlying the stapler and began shipping it again early in the first quarter of 2015. We also began shipment of our Xi Stapler early this quarter.  Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders were approximately $1,830 per procedure compared with $1,930 for both the fourth quarter of 2013 and last quarter. The decrease from the prior year as well as the prior quarter reflects the timing of customer orders and the field action for our da Vinci SI Stapler. Pro forma system revenue of $211 million increased 3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, and increased 37% compared with the third quarter of 2014. The increase in systems revenue compared with the third quarter primarily reflects higher system sales in Europe and U.S. 137 systems replaced in the third quarter, excluding two Xi's traded for Sis under our trade up program, compared with 138 systems in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 111 systems last quarter. 97 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were Xis compared with 59 in the third quarter and 50 in the second quarter. Globally, our system ASP of $1,550,000 increased relative to the ASP for the fourth quarter of last year of $1,460,000 and relative to last quarter of $1,450,000. The increase in ASP is relative to last year reflects product mix with the current quarter included a high mix of Xi's in the fourth quarter of 2013 included a high mix of SIs. The increase in ASP is relative to the last quarter reflect a higher proportion of Xi system, a higher proportion of dual console systems in a positive geographic mix.  Hospital finance approximately 15% of the systems placed in the fourth quarter, down from 27% last quarter. We directly financed 12 systems of which 5 were structured as operating leases. Through the fourth quarter of 2014, we've entered into 14 operating leases. In the U.S., we placed 71 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 72 systems in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 61 systems in the third quarter of 2014. Outside the U.S., we sold 66 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 66 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 48 systems last quarter. Year-over-year system placement reflects growth in Europe, 39 systems this quarter compared with 28 systems last year. And a reduction in Japan's systems, 6 systems this quarter compared with 21 systems last year. Quarter-over-quarter system placement growth reflects higher system placements in Europe and other world market. Fourth quarter system sales included 9 into Italy, 7 into Turkey and 5 into the Nordic countries.  International revenue results were as follows. Fourth quarter pro forma revenue outside the U.S. was $197 million or approximately same as the fourth quarter of 2013 revenue of $195 million, and up 29% compared with $153 million last quarter. Our higher sequential international revenue was driven by increased procedures and higher system sales in a seasonally stronger quarter. Fourth quarter 2014, oU.S. procedure volume was approximately 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013 and 14% higher than the third quarter of this year. Procedure volume was led -- growth was led by DVP but also reflect a strong growth in GYN and general surgery.  Moving on to the remainder of the P&L., pro forma gross margins in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 67.1%, compared with 70.7% for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 67.2% for the third quarter of 2014. Our lower margin percentage relative to prior quarter primarily reflects a high mix of Xi system. In the first quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated costs of settling a number of product liability and legal claims against the company. During the second quarter and the fourth quarter, we recorded additional charges of $10 million and $5 million reflecting additional claims. These claims related to the alleged complications from surgeries performed for certain versions of Monopolor Cautery Scissor or MCS instrument that included in MCS tip cover accessory that was the subject of market withdrawal in 2012. And surgeries that were performed with MCS instruments that were the subject of recall in 2013. Our estimate of the anticipated cost to settling these claims is based on negotiations with attorneys for patients who have participated in the mediation process that the company has established in conjunction with the tolling agreement. We will continue to refine our estimate as we proceed through the negotiation process.  Pro forma operating which exclude the reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP were up 9% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 and were up 2% compared with last quarter. Our fourth quarter 2014 pro forma operating expense compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. The increase compared to last quarter was driven by higher incentive compensation and severance cost.  Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.5% compared with 25.8% for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 27.2% last quarter. The pro forma effective tax rate for 2014 benefited from the release of reserves specific to tax years where we have completed our IRS audit for jurisdiction with the statute of limitation have now expired. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2014 rate benefited from the reinstatement of the Federal Research and Development Credit. We anticipate our pro forma effective rate for 2015 will reflect the more normal range of 28% to 30%. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in mix of U.S. and oU.S. income and will not reflect a Federal, Research and Development Credit unless such credit is reinstated. Our pro forma net income was $184 million or $4.92 per share compared with $193 million or $4.98 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $145 million or $3.91 per share for the third quarter of 2014. Excluding one time tax benefits, our fourth quarter 2014 pro forma net income would have been $159 million or $4.25 per share.  As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I'll now summarize our GAAP results.  GAAP revenue was $605 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $576 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $550 million for the third quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $147 million or $3.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $166 million or $4.28 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $124 million or $3.35 per share for the third quarter of 2014. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.5 billion, up from $2.3 billion as of September 30, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations. During the year we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $1 billion at an average purchase price of $398 per share. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan : Thanks, Marshall. As mentioned earlier, total Q4 year-over-year procedures grew approximately 10% with U.S. procedures growing approximately 8% and international procedures growing approximately 21%. In U.S. urology the uptick in DVP procedure experienced in Q3 continued in Q4.  Given our high-rated penetration in the U.S. prostatectomy market, our DVP volumes are likely to attract overall U.S. prostatectomy volume. Coupled with continued growth in kidney procedures, our overall U.S. urology procedure showed modest growth in 2014. In U.S. gynecology, Q4 results were similar to prior quarters in 2014 with low single digit procedure decline. dVHb volume appears consistent with expected total market benign hysterectomy procedure decline partially offset by growth in cancer procedures. Single site hysterectomy continued to display rapid early growth, off a small base.  Moving onto U.S. general surgery. Adoption continues to be solid across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal and hernia adoption remains a source of strength, while cholecystectomy is declined modestly in the quarter. Over the course of 2014, we've seen shift in focus from cholecystectomy to hernia repair by our general surgeons and sales force. Despite the decline in cholecystectomy this quarter, we continue to hear positive feedback from segments of the patient and surgeon population that see value in the single incision approach of our Single Site technology, or the real time imaging of billary anatomy with our Firefly technology among advantages associated with robotic surgery. Looking more deeply at hernia repair. We are encouraged by robust procedure growth coupled with positive feedback about the clinical outcomes being generated with da Vinci surgery during these early stages of adoption. However, hernia repair is a broad term and the benefits associated with robotic and minimally invasive surgery varies across patient subsets. For ventral hernia, surgeon feedback around the ease of suturing and enhanced vision associated with robotic surgery enables a minimally invasive closure of the primary defect that is similar to open surgery. Relative laparoscopies, da Vinci surgeons have commented on increased inter abdominal surgical dexterity for dissection and suturing has post operative pain and similar or lower material operating cost. For inguinal hernia discussions continue among surgeons about the role of minimally invasive surgery for some procedures. However, da Vinci surgeons have reported to ask that for certain inguinal hernias, there are advantages in transabdominal defect closure and reduction in post operative pain. Defining the subset of hernia repair where robotic surgery is expected to thrive this difficult, particularly in its early days that we are encouraged by our physician commentaries.  Looking abroad, international Q4 procedure growth of approximately 21% continues to be led by global adoption of DVP and other urologic procedures with solid early contributions from gynecology and general surgery.  In Japan, we have seen continued adoption of DVP. Clinical trials to support our reimbursement submissions for partial nephrectomy and gastrectomy have begun enrollment. And we continue discussion with key opinion leading surgeons and surgical society of leadership on other procedures of interest. Recently a population based study of the first year DVP adoption in Japan was completed by researchers from the University of Tokyo and the Cleveland Clinic that included more than 10,000 patients. Published in Cancer Science, the study found that DVP despite being within the first year of broad adoption was associated with the lower complication rate, lower transfusion rate, shorter hospitalization, longer anesthesia time and higher cost compared to open surgery and minimally invasive alternative. There is little detail around how cost was calculated in the study but they appear correlated to anesthesia time. We know from prior studies that with experience both cost and operating room time decline, the offer sound a favorable clinical outcomes with robotic surgery noteworthy during these early phases of the introduction of our technology, offsetting the longer anesthesia time. In Europe, in addition to strong capital sales, we are encouraged by continued clinical developments. While DVP adoption is driving the majority of procedure growth, initial developments in colorectal surgery may establish the foundation for future adoption. Under the leadership of key opinion leading surgeons, the European Academy of Robotic Colorectal Surgeons was launched in December. Through a network of hospitals and surgeons, this group is providing standardized training and proctoring to support the introduction of robotic colorectal surgery across Europe? While there has been cost study published that compare robotic surgery within patient and surgeon population amenable to laparoscopy, additional cost studies with appropriate competitors will publish this quarter.  I'll quickly review one from the University of Pittsburgh published in the journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons to compare robotic to laparoscopic and open benign hysterectomy among surgeons who most commonly perform open surgery. The study review nearly 5,000 benign hysterectomies performed by 237 surgeons across 10 hospitals from 2011 to 2013, including a 119 surgeon that predominantly performed open hysterectomies. Using actual cost data during the hospital stay, the authors found that when open surgeon perform robotic and laparoscopic procedures, the costs were similar on an operating cost basis, including an add on cost for robotic maintenance and deprecation resulted in higher cost for robotic surgeries. But the authors noted a bias in its analysis due to the exclusion of similar costs associated with laparoscopic procedure. In conclusion, the authors stated, although laparoscopic hysterectomy had the lowest cost overall, robotics maybe no more costly than laparoscopic hysterectomy when performed by surgeons who predominantly perform open hysterectomy.  This concludes my remarks. And thank you for time. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our financial outlook for 2015. Starting with procedures. As described in on our announcement last week, 2014 total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 9% to roughly 570,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2015, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 7% to 10%. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2015 as we've experienced in previous year. With Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset.  With respect to revenue guidance, consistent with last year we will not be providing specific revenue guidance. We do expect 2015 capital sales to follow the historical seasonal patterns with key one being sequentially lower than the recently completed Q4. We will face foreign exchange headwinds in 2015 based upon the impacts of the stronger U.S. dollar.  Turning to gross profit. We expect our 2015 pro forma gross profit margin to be fairly consistent with Q4, 2014 based upon the anticipated proportion of Xi stapler and other new products with lower gross profit margins in our product mix and the foreign exchange headwinds I mentioned earlier, partially offset by cost reduction realized during the year. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon product mix and systems production volume.  Turning to operating expenses. We expect to grow pro forma 2015 operating expenses between 7% and 10% above 2014 levels. As we have stated previously, we believe it is fundamentally early days for computer assisted surgery and we will continue to make investments to pursue significant growth opportunities. We expect our non cash stock compensation expense to range between $180 million and $185 million in 2015, compared to $169 million in 2014. We expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $14 million and $16 million in 2015. With regard to income tax. As Marshall described, we expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 28% and 30% of pretax income depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast is consistent with our 2014 pro forma tax rate excluding the impact of tax reserve releases in 2014 and does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015. Our share count for calculating diluted EPS in Q4, 2014 was approximately 37.3 million shares. We estimate our Q1, 2015 diluted share count to range between 37.4 and 37.6 million shares.  That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We take our first question from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead, sir.
Ben Andrew: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, can you talk a little about the investment plans in terms of dollars, breaking down international versus U.S.? Are you adding people in the field in the U.S. in 2015? And, if so, to what extent and then maybe talk a little bit more about the specific investments overseas that you are making. 
Gary Guthart: Sure. With regard to sales headcount, in U.S. we'll have -- I'd anticipate modest growth in U.S. headcount not a ton. oU.S. in terms of commercial organization will be a greater source of investment. Some of it is in field headcount; some of it is clinical trial effort and dollars, some in economies and economists. So a bit of mix. 
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then Marshall on the gross margin side, you gave us some good thoughts there in terms of the guidance. How much is FOREX impacting that and when should you get to a volume on Xi, Xi instrument where we would start to see a normalization of gross margin? 
Marshall Mohr: So will FX about little over 20% of or revenues are FX based and if you trickle that all the way down to would that impact is on the bottom line because we do have costs that are also FX based. You get down to where the impact is less than 3%. As far as the gross margin goes, we will be ramping Xi obviously production given the volumes we did last quarter. And we will continue to try up to worked down cost overall of Xi. And that's typical with all new products but I am not sure of that you should count on it getting to the fit on par with Xi. It is a more advanced, it is equipment with higher complexity.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then you talked about the revenue per case on instrumentation being down because of the product withdrawal, should we see a bounce bank in Q1 and could it overshoot a bit even as you obviously got lower volumes but then flow through the years, so we could see a more traditional sort of stocking of instrumentation as you rollout staplers and roll these other products out? 
Marshall Mohr: Yes. I think that the bigger impact in quarter frankly wasn't the field state for action; it was actually a customer buying pattern. We saw fewer stocking orders being filled associated with system shipment and then the distributor buying pattern are also -- if you remember last year first quarter, we had a higher amount of sold through distributors than Q2 was down I believe. So anyway the pattern really drove more of that change than did the field action. Having said that, we would think just like we commented in Q2 that we would see more normalization over time of the instrument and accessory for our procedure. 
Patrick Clingan : Yes, and Ben, kind of looking forward at the IMA revenue procedure, you are looking kind of full year 2014, it was 1,880 per procedure. And as we discussed earlier, revenue, the IMA revenue based in foreign currency is definitely going to be facing headwinds based on the stronger U.S. dollar and will weigh on the overall metric and as you saw in 2014, the IMA revenue for procedure will vary from quarter - to -quarter largely based on this timing kind of factors. In regards to procedure mix, we don't necessarily see that moving the dial either up or down on that. Although there are swing items in relation to the metric. One would be our relative success with the stapler and Vessel Sealer utilization and where our revenue procedures higher on where these advanced instruments are used and conversely a higher proportion of Single Site cases would weigh on the metric. 
Operator: Next we will go to the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. 
Bob Hopkins: Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. So Gary, just to start out, I am sorry if I missed this, but could you walk through your assumptions for buyback in 2015? If you are not assuming a buyback, I am curious as to why and what the other priorities might be for your cash.
Gary Guthart : We are not declaring anything at this time. When we think about uses of cash we really think about a couple of things One of them is use to invest in those things that we talked about, the ability to improve our presence in oU.S. market, some investment in both operational efficiency and new innovations. And the ability to respond to opportunity as it comes technologically or otherwise. Where we see opportunity to return our cash to shareholders, we've demonstrated that we will and we keep our eyes open on a routine basis for those opportunities. 
Bob Hopkins: Are there better M&A opportunities out there than you have seen in the past?
Gary Guthart : We have been thoughtful and persistent for years now. And so we - I wouldn't comment it strongly one way or another, only that we are thoughtful and engaged in those investigations all the time, nothing is really change in our rhythm or pattern in the last eight quarters. 
Bob Hopkins: And then lastly I wanted to ask for a real update on Sp. I know the timelines have moved around there. Can you just highlight exactly what your expectations are for rollout and approval milestones as we think about the course of 2015 and into 2016?
Gary Guthart : So where we are -- what we are trying to achieve on Sp, Sp is our dedicated single port platform. As we've talked about last year, our intent is to bring some of the functionality and features there. We had brought forward in Xi and have been well received by both our customers and by folks who review our products into the Sp, we are doing that now. That feels pretty good to me; I think it is the right set of decisions to make. We will develop those products and assemble them in the front half of the year and start getting customer feedback on them into the back half of the year. We are working with regulatory bodies about what submissions might look like. We don't have timeline to share with you on what our submissions will be and as those firm up, we will communicate them with you. 
Bob Hopkins: Okay and then maybe just sneak one more in on Japan just really quickly. I am trying to gauge your confidence on the topic of Japan and whether or not you're confident at this point in suggesting that by the time we get to 2016, we will see increases that can drive better procedure volume growth at that time. It is really a question of gauging your confidence based on what you know today.
Gary Guthart : We are actively involved. I can't give you a number or binary decision on it. We have several conversations going on and real work in several different procedure categories. There are lots of people who have high interest in Japan and in our products. Lot of our existing customers and future customers. And we are working on it diligently. There are several milestones that have to be met. Both on the path we are on and some alternative pathways. That our real decisions on the part of government decision makers as to where they want to go and how they want to proceed. And it would be premature to try forecast for you what those decisions would be. 
Operator: And next we will go to the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. 
Tao Levy : Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to ask a little bit if you can maybe expand on what you said in the prepared remarks regarding the early uptake in hysterectomy of the Wristed Single-Site instruments. Certainly, what type of procedures, what type of patients, which surgeons are starting to adopt it, and is it cannibalizing multi-arm hysterectomies? Anything like that would be helpful.
Gary Guthart : Sure. The primary procedure that the Wristed Needle Driver, Single Site Wristed Needle Driver being used for is benign hysterectomy and it is being pursued for patients who have interest in single incision. We see a mixture of existing robotic surgeons and those who have not approached da Vinci systems before so it is both folks who are currently engaged with us as customers and those who have not prior engaged, we see a mixture of both of those. Product is performing well; really demand has been really good. And what we really want to watch and track is what happens on reorders and how people really experience it as we go forward. We see a little bit of both in the early stages. A little bit of switching multi port procedures into Single Site and a little bit of approaching patients that otherwise would not have been done necessarily multi port robotically. So we are seeing both of those things. And we will take some quarters I think to shake out where people ultimately find that optimization. I am not too stressed about, a little bit of cannibalization here. I think that goes with the territory and we will support surgeons taking the approach they think is most appropriate. 
Tao Levy : Okay, that's helpful. The question on the price of the Si-e, I noticed in your latest presentation that's now -- has an ASP of around -- or at least last year -- of around $600,000, and the prior year, it was closer to $1 million. In terms of the pricing of that system, what is the objective? In the past, you have talked about sort of outpatient surgery being a potential opportunity if the pricing structure was correct for kind of the hospitals. Is that part of that or there's just pricing pressure, you are trying to prevent competition from coming in at a lower price?
Gary Guthart : Well, we have as you know we have a range of options, so at the low end and I don't -- I would not read that chart is saying that the ASP of Si-e is that number. I'll just showing you kind of where the low end is and that is looking at D featured Sis, the lower feature content Si-es and including things like Firefly and so on so you take those things out that moves to you low in the range. With regard to, do we think that there is possibility in other types of care, other sites of care; I think the answer that is yes. So you think about both -- there is kind of duration of care when you talk about things like outpatient, but there is both duration and location. How longer they are in the hospital and where is it being performed. And we see increases in both. Increases in shorter duration stay and increase in robotic surgery and different locations. And so Si and Si-e some of those lower prices packages are designed to give an option to some of the customers who are interesting in exploring in that space. And so we've seen some interested, I don't think it's been a wild interest, unabashed interest but we have seen some interest and we have seen some uptick. And you just see that reflected in some sales and placement numbers that we shared with you. 
Tao Levy : And just lastly, just a quick clarification, the Xi Single-Site instruments that you're talking about, that's different than the Sp?
Gary Guthart : That is different, right. So the -- exactly the Single Site instruments are the one that go through curved cannulas. They work on the same patient site platform as a Xi, the ones that we are developing now and they are kind of an instrument and accessory kit rather than a new patient site system. Sp is a dedicated single port patient site, different mechanism, different robot system that delivers it. And those are at different price points. And they have different capabilities. And as Sp progresses we will share more of what that product looks like and some of those distinctions with our customers and with you as we go.
Operator: And the next we will go to the line of Amit Hazan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan: Thanks, good afternoon. Can you hear me, okay guys? Okay, good. Maybe let me just start with the chole side, and obviously the slowdown is quite pronounced if you think about it from 2013 to where we are in Q4 of 2014. So I know there is not one driver there. I just maybe want to get some color on the different buckets of impact, and most importantly kind of the trend line now indicates really declines are going to be in the works for next year. And just help us try to assess where the bottom might be to that category.
Gary Guthart : Let me frame for you how we are thinking about it and I'll let Patrick take you through a little bit more of the analytics of it. We look at Single Site we think there are things that are important for a procedure long term. And that it is that it is repeatable and teachable, safe and efficacious. And we think it is. There is a patient population that cares about it. And in Single Site we think that's true. And then the economics work and we think the economics works for that population. Then the question becomes one of how big is that population and what's access like and that's really what we've seen here is plenty of really gross and Patrick, I'll let you taking it from there.
Patrick Clingan : Yes, Amit. And what -- when we look at where systems have I guess are pressured for access based on their volumes and we are seeing declines -- the first procedure that tends to get squeezed is a cholecystectomy. In the surgeons for which we are seeing a combination of chole and hernia where choles are declining, we are seeing total growth in the volume of procedures these surgeons are performing which is encouraging because they are finding where it fits best in their practice. But over time based on the underlying advantage of the technologies what we are hearing from surgeons, we are hearing from patients who get a single incision outcome, and given some of the underlying patient demographics and the population who gets a cholecystectomy, we are encouraged there is something here that will be a part of over the long run.
Amit Hazan: All right. And then if I can shift over to revenue per procedure again, just I think at this point I want to try to better understand the patterns of stocking order, just given kind of the volatility or variability we saw in 2014. I think specifically what I would like to understand better is the reason it has been more volatile in the last few quarters, kind of maybe asking the impact beyond the simple math of how many systems you sell in a given quarter and the stocking associated with it, but why is that more volatile? Why are you not able to control that a little bit on a -- better on a quarter-to-quarter basis?
Patrick Clingan : Yes. We kind of saw similar thing in Q2 with the revenue per procedure was a bit lower than norms, and here in Q4 you had a kind of bounce bank in Q3 and we are recalling out in each of the quarter really is this timing of customer orders. In this last quarter it was timing of various types of orders including stocking orders associated with new systems sales. Fewer of those coming through in the quarter than they may have been according to historical norms. You have timing of orders within international distributors and just general timing of orders. So as I mentioned earlier not so much to do with things like procedure mix. And so is there a pattern? So this I think your question is there a pattern? I don't think there is. I think these things just tend to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and balance out over longer period of time.
Operator: And next we will go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
David Lewis: Good afternoon. Gary, just two quick questions. Going back to chole for a second, earlier in the year you reduced the price of the chole instrumentation, which actually seemed to have a successful impact on driving incremental growth. Why do you think that strategy didn't have more staying power and would you consider further cuts in chole to drive adoption of that procedure? Then kind of related, Gary, how do you think hernia and the market development around hernia is related and is there an opportunity to use a similar pricing strategy for hernia to drive adoption? And I had a quick follow-up.
Gary Guthart : Sure. So on the chole side on pricing we think that where we are right now on chole pricing with Single Site is really appropriate. If you look at a system that's getting average utilization, the consumable cost of that procedure in compare to multiple alternatives we think we are right in there in terms of being competitive and appropriate value for what Single Site can bring. So I think we are in a good spot there. I think the biggest thing and Patrick alluded to it and the biggest thing we are hearing back from our customers is that as they look at competition for time on the robot, they are making decisions about which case is get schedules and which ones are don't. And that's a near term problem, I think in the U.S. we saw an increase in procedure per system, so that turnaround in the year where we are building capacity in the beginning part of 2014. The field is now being consuming capacity on the robots in the U.S. I think hernia is driving that. And so part of that is this issue of which one does a surgeon and an institution find greater value and at the moment they have to make that decision. And I think that's been a primary driver is that competition. And we will see over time if that capacity grows out and we have a broader set of options for them to choose from, whether that modulates, we will have to watch over the next few quarters and see how these two play together. The economics of hernia are interesting and a little bit different. The laparoscopic hernia repair uses a different mix of instrument than chole's do. It is more expensive mix using one of our systems instead of laparoscopic allows for trade up some more expensive laparoscopic instruments. And so our economic value there is well supportive where we are in currently. I think that looks very good. Here the thing is that not all hernias aren't exchanged between laparoscopy and da Vinci, a lot of them are still unopened, surprising numbers are still unopened and the economics also look good there. So hernias economics -- the reports we are hearing back are pretty solid and we are feeling like we are in the pretty good position. 
David Lewis: Great, Gary, very helpful. Just one quick question on Sp timing. It was encouraging to hear your conviction that the delay then for the system is moving according to plan, at least that's what I heard. Just trying to understand the timing here. You're going to lease this product to physicians in the first half. You're going to collect feedback from those physicians in the second half, so I am assuming that feedback is going to get incorporated into the device. Is it safe to assume there can't be a design lock, then, of the system until the end of 2015 or early 2016, or can you submit additional modules to the FDA before you have a design lock or am I just thinking about this the wrong way?
Gary Guthart : It is interesting question. I think the answer is that you are always moving to a point which you like to design to allow for submission and then further feedback and iteration right, a product design is fundamentally iterative, and when you make a decision to submit, it depends a lot on where you are, what you see and what kind of performance you are seeing in the product. So you ought to think about these as kind of sequential locks not a big one with capital well. I think from a technology development point of view I am quite pleased. I think we have a fantastic team. I think that they are bringing technologies forward that we expect and that are going to make a difference. Surgeon evaluations part of the process and so as those designs gets the point that it makes sense to get feedback, we will absolutely do it and I'll do that through multiple forums both in house and potential out of house and we will work through that. 
Operator: And next we will go to the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
David Roman: Thank you and good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted just to start with international, and if I look at the past two quarters, I think the third quarter you benefited from a pretty significant order in China. Then Q4 saw a nice step up in Europe. Can you maybe just sort of talk about the sustainability of this uplift outside the United States, and to what extent this is tied to some of the discretionary spending investments you have made over the course of the year versus either macroeconomic factors or other things we need to consider?
Gary Guthart : When we -- when you look at just kind of stepping back, we look at out different opportunities outside of the United States. I think that there are interesting and durable long -term opportunities oU.S. Having said that, they can be really lumpy and one of the reasons that we've seen the kind of capital lumpiness that you just described is because there are different market access requirements in different countries. For example, what approvals look like in China is totally different than what they look like in Japan. And different again from what they might look like in different parts of Europe. So long term, we are very positive and it is the motivation for the investments we made. Short term, expect lumpiness, it can require quotas or approvals or data submission and in each countries it is a little bit different. 
David Roman: Okay and maybe just a follow-up on the U.S. and specifically the impact of the Xi system. Could you maybe give us some feedback now that we are kind of three quarters into the launch on whether this type of -- this launch is playing out similarly to past ones, meaning that people really want to do colorectal, for example, and need the Xi to do it, or that people are getting the Xi and now they're building colorectal programs? How is the whole picture on some of those more advanced categories coming together, now that we are kind of nine months into the introduction of the system?
Gary Guthart : I think, first thing the Xi launch has exceeded our expectations in terms of mix just because in prior launches we had few different instruments and accessories that had to be brought to the market concurrently with the system launch. And now we have things like Firefly and stapling and vessels sealers, a little more complex instrument set. And so those have been launched in the market in the staggering way based on conversation with regulators and other pragmatic constraints. So it was unclear as to when different folks would step into acquire that system and we are pleased with the rate at which Xi has been adopted in U.S. and in Europe for that matter. So that part has been really good. You think about colorectal just to go back to your assertion, colorectal was growing pretty nicely on the Si base already, so there have been interest and pursued of colorectal, so there is a group of surgeons who are both interested and skilled and moving forward and Xi allows them to keep going. So in a sense it is -- that's virtual cycle. You have some folks who have experienced, Xi gives them a little greater capability as they stepped in and start to use it, they are trying to explore that greater capability and that drives further growth and so we have seen that. We have been also pleasantly surprised by feedback from some more of our longer term customers in urology and general oncology who also found better thing in Xi that perhaps exceeded what we thought they might in the very beginning.
David Roman: That's helpful. If I could just sneak one more in here, Gary, you began the call, I think, with describing 2014 as a year of transition and macroeconomic headwinds, uncertainty about the Affordable Care Act. How would you describe the environment as we exit 2014 and as you've talked to customers in 2015, either on the capital side or the procedure volume side on a 12 month basis?
Gary Guthart : Yes. I think at the C-suite levels we are seeing their ability to forecast their business start improve and that they have still have to make priorities. It is not like -- it is a windfall on all fronts but they are able to project a little bit better than they were before, they've got a year of the Affordable Care Act under their belt and that gives them some confidence to start making some decisions. That said, there are still capital priority discussion and other things within this institutions and those kinds of conversations continue. On the clinical side, I think the conversation is much the way it has been for the last couple of years. I think folks are looking at outcomes and the cost they are probably pay for those outcomes and where they find values then they are willing to invest and pursuing. And so in that sense we've been pleased with the growth of general surgery in the year. It is strengthened nicely as we have gone and so that's kind of how we've seen it. 
Operator: And next we will go to the line of Rich Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. 
Richard Newitter: Hi, thank you for taking the questions. Gary, I was wondering just with respect to your comments on chole regarding the time availability factor that might be contributing to the pullback and it sounds like it's a little bit of cannibalization into hernia, but what are you seeing in accounts where maybe Xi has been placed for a few months now? What are you seeing with respect to the trend of chole utilization? Is that alleviating some of the time constraint issues?
Gary Guthart : With regard to Xi systems? 
Richard Newitter: Yes, so maybe where you had choles being done and a Xi was placed, which presumably, assuming it's not a first robotic placement might alleviate some of the time availability issues.
Gary Guthart : Yes. So it's actually good question. I don't have the answer at my finger tips. 
Richard Newitter: Okay, fair enough. Then if I could on the procedure volume guidance, maybe Calvin, 7% to 10%, that's your range. Is it fair to assume the various momentum factors behind your different procedure categories in the fourth quarter, those are essentially how we should be thinking about the composition of growth comprising that 7% to 10% or is it just a continuation of the trends we saw in 4Q and carry those over to 2015 to model that growth rate?
Calvin Darling : Yes. I mean just kind of at high level view assumptions going into the 7% to 10% guidance range. We are anticipating similar U.S. gynecology and urology macro trends that we saw in 2014, continuing on into 2015 and we absolutely expect that the U.S. general surgery and international will continue to drive procedure growth in 2015 as they did in 2014. Particular swing items that could move you towards the lower end or the higher end of the range would be changes in those macro trends in gynecology and urology. Those are large sets of procedures and as we saw in this last couple of years, those things can definitely move to dial growth rates in early stage U.S. general surgery procedures, how they-- trajectory they follow, it is going to be important to international growth side of things and as was discussed a little earlier just how successful we are with Wristed Needle Driver contribution and how that may impact the benign hysterectomy. 
Operator: And we will next go to the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Please go ahead. 
Larry Keusch: Hi, good afternoon. Gary, can we circle back to Sp and help us think about the procedures that again you are targeting on that system and how we should think about that relative to the current Single-Site system that is out there?
Gary Guthart : Sure. Rather than thinking about procedures I guided to what is it do differently and because I think it is early and it has a lot of long-term possibility but predicting exactly which one is when is going to be hard. What do they differently? It delivers four computer assisted or robotically assisted instrument through a parallel access that can go fairly deep into the body through an entry point. And so when we think about that, that you think about accessing the throat or the head or neck area transorally. You think about trans- umbilical things that might be able to reach that are otherwise hard to reach with an architecture like Single Site or trans-anal procedures or transvaginal procedures now you can think a lot about and we think about what if these stages that surgeons can affect, positively impact with the technology like that or an opportunity like that. And they are fairly diverse and pretty interesting. And then you have to go all the way through some of the testing and evaluation that we were talking about during this year which is what can actually done and that what kind of efficiency and what kind of price points and that's where the heavy lifting is. So on a long term, I think it will open some interesting doors. Near term, we are not ready to call procedure side as -- 
Larry Keusch: Okay, and then just lastly, if you could maybe dissect a little bit about the procedures as you look through the year and talk a little bit about the seasonality that you saw actually in the benign procedures through the year. I am just curious if those -- if there are any observations that you can make relative to benign procedures --
Gary Guthart : It is a good question. I'll have Patrick to jump in.
Patrick Clingan : Hi, Larry. I think if you just look at the way in which the year played out, the first quarter tended to be a little bit weaker relative to the rest of the year, so from an extent you could say that there was more seasonality and some of those benign procedures over the course of the year, that said at the beginning of the year there were also a lot of disruption with the implementation the Affordable Care Act. So it is hard to necessarily pin it on seasonality. But to the extent that there was seasonality last year, just beware because we still have a significant component of our business in those benign procedures. 
Gary Guthart : That was the last question, thank you. As we've said while we focus on financial metrics such as revenue, profit and cash flow during this conference call. Our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcome and reducing surgical trauma. I hope you are following the assessment of latest system the da Vinci Xi by Dr. Harkins, a Texas general surgeon, gives you some sense of the impact our products have in surgery. Cole, despite my obvious interest in minimally invasive surgery, I had resisted adopting previous da Vinci platforms because of what I felt the limitations. The da Vinci Xi platform is a game changer for me. And I now feel that this technology will not just equal my standard laparoscopic abilities but actually allow me to reach new levels in providing surgical care to my patients. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. I thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And I look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, again that does conclude our teleconference call for this afternoon. Again, thank you very much for your participation. And you may now disconnect.

Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us on the call today. In this third quarter our customers have continued to advance minimally invasive surgery through the use of their da Vinci surgical systems. Total da Vinci procedures grew nearly 10% over prior year led by multifaceted growth in general surgery and growth in urology in Europe and Asia. Capital placements in the quarter were solid, totaling 111 systems with strong performance outside of the United States. Our newest system da Vinci Xi is receiving favorable reviews and interest from our customers. Looking more closely at the United States, growth in general surgery lead the way with procedure -- with the procedure category, our second largest behind gynecology. General surgery procedure growth was broad-based, including conol resection, rectal resection and hernia repair. Trends present in prior quarters in gynecology continued with stable trends in hysterectomy for malignant conditions combined with the slight decline in benign hysterectomy versus prior year. Urology grew in the U.S. in the quarter, with strength in prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy. Given the large proportion of da Vinci use in prostate cancer surgery, the increase in da Vinci prostatectomy likely reflects broader trends in patient care. Turning to systems in the United States, we placed 61 systems in the quarter, 8% of this systems were our newest product the da Vinci Xi Surgical System. In Europe, procedure growth returned to form, growth in Germany improved materially. Likewise, I'm pleased with our performance in France with multiple segments contributing. Growth in Italy, U.K. and the Nordic countries was also encouraging and broad-based. Capital sales in Europe were strong. We continue to see capital segmentation with interest in both our most featured product the da Vinci Xi System, as well as interest in refurbished systems acquired by price sensitive customers. In Asia, the urology category leads continues to lead in volume, while procedure growth was driven by both urology and general surgery. As you know from last quarter, we are in the midst of a transition of our commercial business from our distribution partner in Japan to a direct team. We are building our direct sales organization, as well as building deeper marketing, service and support functions to better serve our Japanese customers. I'm encouraged by their progress. We continue to pursue additional reimbursement in Japan and surgeons have initiated prospective clinical trials to gather data for this purpose. The reimbursement process in Japan can be lengthy. We will report on our progress as we gain greater clarity. Turning to the capital sales in Asia, as we've said in the past, timing of placements can be lumpy and Q3 is no exception. We placed 19 systems in the region, 10 of which were to customers in China. Given the role of governments and reimbursements and approvals, the timing of system placements remains hard to predict. Taken together, our non-GAAP pro forma operating performance for the third quarter is as follows, procedures grew nearly 10% over the third quarter of 2013. We placed 111 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 101 during the third quarter of last year. Pro forma total revenue was $534 million, up 7% from last year. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue was $272 million, up 14% over Q3 of 2013. Total pro forma recurring revenue grew to $380 million, up 12% from prior year and comprising 71% of total pro forma revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $197 million, down 14% from the third quarter of last year and representing 37% of Q3 revenue. Pro forma net income was $145 million, down 45% over last year, and cash and investments in the quarter grew by $219 million. Our new products continued to gain acceptance with customers. Starting with systems, da Vinci Xi has been well-received. It is being used in a wide range of procedures, including urology, gynecology, general surgery and thoracic surgery. Positive customer feedback highlights the flexibility and efficiency of set-up, the ability of the system to work over a large workspace in the body, the ability of the endoscope to move to any port and the integration and convenience of the imaging system, including Firefly. Urologist, colorectal surgeons and general surgeons have been the main proponents for Xi System purchases to date. Also, we received regulatory clearance for da Vinci Xi in Korea earlier this month. With regard to our dedicated single-port platform da Vinci Sp, we continue to make progress and design for manufacturability and compatibility with Xi. I believe Sp will have strong applicability for procedures in which a single small entry point to the body and parallel delivery of instrument is important. A good example is head and neck surgery. We anticipate initiating clinical use of our Xi compatible Sp in the latter half of 2015 likely in support of regulatory submissions. We are planning a measured role out of Sp as we receive necessary clearances and optimize our supply chain and now do not expect 510(k) clearance for our Xi compatible Sp in 2015. Turning to instruments, we initiated a soft use of our da Vinci Si Stapler in the quarter after three reports of malfunction. Our investigation has identifying -- identified the underlying causes of the malfunctions and our team has developed potential solutions. We are making good progress in validating these solutions and we will update our customers and you once these validations are complete. Finally, we have received 510(k) regulatory clearance and initiated first cases for our Single-Site Wristed Needle Driver, an important addition to our product line for use in single-incision surgery with the Si platform. The Wristed Needle Driver is the first instrument of its kind, a fully articulating single-port surgery instrument that returns to the surgeon in a wrist capability in a single-incision format. Gynecologist performing single-incision hysterectomy are expressing a high level of interest and excitement about the Wristed Needle Driver. Surgeons performing initial cases with the Wristed Needle Driver have integrated it seamlessly into their cases, bringing a wrist to Single-Site platform for da Vinci Si further enhances Si’s capability and ease-of-use for surgeons pursuing single-incision technique and provide a capable and cost-effective platform for our customers. In summary, we are passionately pursuing the long-term opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and are focused on the following. First, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery using da Vinci systems worldwide. Building da Vinci capability and supporting its use in general surgery. Disciplined execution in our new product launches and finally continuing to invest in our capabilities in key international markets. I will now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. I’ll be describing our results on a non-GAAP pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and investment impairments. We’re providing pro forma information in addition to GAAP information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later. We’ve posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion. Pro forma third quarter revenue was $534 million, up 7% compared with $499 million for the third quarter of 2013 and up 5% from last quarter. Procedure growth for the third quarter rounded up to approximately 10%. Compared with the third quarter of 2013, it was seasonally slower by approximately 1% compared with the last quarter. Procedure highlights will be discussed by Patrick. Pro forma revenue excludes the impact of offers made to customers to trade-in their recently purchased SI product for newly introduced Xi product. As discussed last quarter with the introduction of da Vinci Xi surgical system, we offered certain customers in the U.S. and Europe, the ability to trade-in their recently purchased da Vinci SI surgical systems for da Vinci Xi surgical system. These trade-in offers also provided these customers the opportunity to exchange certain da Vinci Si instruments and accessories for da Vinci Xi instruments and accessories. As a result of these offers, we reserved $26 million of U.S. revenue in the first quarter and reserved $6 million of European revenue in the second quarter. As these customers accepted or declined their trade-in offers, we refined our estimates of the revenue reserves. In the third quarter, we recognized $16 million of revenue, reflecting eight trade-outs completed and a refinement of the number of customers that we expect to accept our offer. Pro forma results exclude the impact of this program. As of September 30th, we had $4 million of reserves for three trade-ins that we expect to occur in the fourth quarter.  Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue of $272 million was up 14%, compared with the third quarter of 2013. It was up 4% compared with the second quarter of 2014. The increase relative to last year primarily reflects increased procedures, new-product revenue and increased stocking orders. The increase relative to last quarter primarily reflects customer buying patterns, new product revenue and increased stocking orders. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,930 per procedure, compared with $1,860 in the third quarter of 2013 and $1,830 last quarter. Pro forma systems revenue of $154 million decreased 3% compared with the third quarter of 2013, an increase of 11% compared with last quarter. We placed 111 systems in the third quarter, excluding the eight Xi-es traded for Si-es under our traded program. Compared with 101 systems placed last year and 96 last quarter, six of the systems placed -- just six of the system placements in the quarter and three of the placements in the second quarter of 2014 were structured as operating leases. The system average selling price for the third quarter was $1.45 million, which is lower than the $1.56 million recognized in the third quarter last year and $1.5 million recognized in the second quarter of this year. The decreases compared to prior quarters reflect a greater number of trade-ins and products sold to cost sensitive customers particularly in Europe. 59 or a little more than half of the 111 systems placed in the third quarter were da Vinci Xi models. 38 were Si models, seven were Si-es and seven were S models. Hospitals financed approximately 27% of systems placed in the third quarter, down from 37% last quarter. We directly financed 11, of which six were structured as operating leases and five as sales type leases. Through the third quarter of 2014, we have entered into nine operating leases. The amount of revenue that we recognized in any future quarter for these operating leases will be immaterial. In the U.S., we placed 61 systems in the third quarter compared with 65 systems last year and 61 systems last quarter. Outside the U.S., third quarter pro forma revenue was $153 million, up 15% compared with revenue of $133 million in the third quarter of last year and up 14% compared with revenue of $135 million last quarter. Our higher year-over-year U.S. revenue was driven by increased procedures and higher system sales. Our higher sequential OUS revenue primarily reflects higher system sales, partially offset by a seasonal decline in procedures. Third quarter 2014 procedure volume outside the U.S. was approximately 20% higher than the third quarter of 2013 and 4% lower than the second quarter of this year. The growth over the prior year reflects DVP growth in Europe and Japan. The decrease compared to last quarter primarily reflects third quarter seasonality in Europe, partially offset by increased procedures in Asia. We placed 50 systems outside of the U.S. in the third quarter, including 25 in the Europe and 7 into Japan, compared with 36 into outside the U.S. in the third quarter of 2013, which included 17 into Europe and 13 into Japan and 35 systems outside the U.S. last quarter, which included 19 into Europe and 5 into Japan. Third quarter system sales included 10 into China and 9 into Germany. The sales in the China were completed under tender offers following the Ministry of Health’s announcement in 2013 that 38 hospitals were eligible to import da Vinci systems through 2015. The Ministry of Health announcement does not represent a commitment to purchase and we do not expect additional systems to be sold under the tender in the fourth quarter. And there's no assurance that the remaining 28 hospitals will purchase systems. Sales in new markets and markets where we have limited reimbursements like Japan will be lumpy. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, pro forma gross margins were 67.2% in the third quarter of 2014, compared with 73.8% for the third quarter of 2013 and 69.2% for the second quarter of 2014. Our lower margin percentage reflects a higher mix of new product sales including the da Vinci Xi system, costs associated with our stapler or stop use and scope recall, costs related to purchase accounting for the buyout of our Japanese distributors market rights and service costs associated with product recalls in the Xi rollout. In the first quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated costs of settling a number of product liability legal claims against the company. During the second quarter, we recorded an additional $10 million charge reflecting additional claims. Our estimates remained unchanged in the third quarter and we paid out approximately $16 million associated with previously accrued amounts. Pro forma operating expenses which exclude reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of intangibles were $162 million for the third quarter of 2014, compared with $138 million for the third quarter of 2013 and $155 million for the second quarter of 2014. The increase in pro forma operating expense in the third quarter relative to the second quarter reflects costs associated with new product launches, cost for expanding our operations in Japan and Europe and increased incentive compensation. We expect operating expenses to ramp in the fourth quarter primarily associated with international expansion, particularly in Japan and Europe and new product launches. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 27.2% compared with 17% for the third quarter of 2013 and 29.8% last quarter. The tax rate for the third quarter of 2013 included the reversal of reserves where statutes of limitations had expired. The reduction in rate from the second quarter of 2014 reflects an increase of non-U.S. taxable income relative to U.S. taxable income. Our pro forma net income was $145 million or $3.92 per share, compared with $194 million or $4.94 per share for the third quarter of 2013 and $140 million or $3.73 per share for the second quarter of 2014. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $550 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared with $499 million for the third quarter of 2013 and $512 million for the second quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $124 million or $3.35 per share for the third quarter of 2014 compared with $157 million or $3.99 per share for the third quarter of 2013 and $104 million or $2.77 per share for the second quarter of 2014. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $2.3 billion, up from $2 billion as of June 30, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations. We've completed the repurchase of stock under our 1 billion accelerated stock repurchase program. Under the program, we purchased a total of 2.5 million shares at an average purchase price of $397.52 per share. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over procedure and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan: Thanks Marshall. As mentioned earlier, total Q3 year-over-year procedures grew nearly 10% with U.S. procedures growing 8% and international procedures growing 20%. U.S. procedure results were broadly similar to our commentary after Q2 with the exception of dVP which was better than expected. Given our high-rated penetration in the U.S. prostatectomy market. Our dVP volumes are likely to attract overall U.S. prostatectomy volume. In U.S. gynecology, Q3 results were similar to the first half of 2014 with low-single-digit procedure declines. dVHb volume appears consistent with expected total market benign hysterectomy procedure decline while the myomectomy negative year-over-year trend continued from the second quarter. Single site hysterectomy grew quickly off the small base. And we will monitor the adoption of our wristed single-site needle drivers impact on this procedure. Moving onto U.S. general surgery. Adoption continues to be solid across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal procedure adoption remains a source of strength. It is too early to precisely estimate the impact the stapler-stop shift action may have on our procedure growth. Though initial inspection suggests it may weight on colorectal procedure growth. Single Single-Site cholecystectomy continue to grow in Q3, though at a more modest rate relative to the first half of 2014. Hernia growth remains encouraging in this early phase of adoption. In addition, the robust procedure growth for hernia repair, we are hearing positive feedback from surgeons about the clinical outcomes being generated with their da Vinci Surgical Systems. During the quarter, one of the first studies comparing robotic and laparoscopic ventral hernia was published supporting the feedback we have been receiving. These results when combined with some of their early cost analysis that suggest robotics has a similar level of material operating costs as laparoscopic ventral hernia repair gives us belief that the current adoption is sustainable. Looking abroad, international procedure growth of 20% continues to be lead by global adoption of dVP and other urologic procedures with solid early contributions from gynecology and general surgery. Procedure growth rebounded in Europe after holidays weighed on Q2 growth rate. In Japan, we have observed a slight disruption to procedure growth in Q3 as we transition sales and service to our direct organization. We believe that this is temporary in nature and expect to stabilize as we move towards the direct selling model. Recently clinical trials to support our reimbursement submissions for partial nephrectomy and gastrectomy have begun enrollment. Though it is uncertain how quickly these trials will enroll and whether they will achieve the outcomes needed to support reimbursement. We continue to expect international procedure adoption to be a driver of procedure growth. And the opportunity for da Vinci surgery is substantial. As we said in the past, quarterly procedure growth rates may be lumpy as adoption is not uniform across countries and procedures. One of the challenges of evaluating clinical and economic advances in surgery is the diversity in patient and surgeon population. As da Vinci is used in more and different types of procedures, well-done studies evaluated in the clinical and economic efficacy, consider the impact of new technology and techniques on different segments of the patient population and surgeon population. They evaluate important pre-existing conditions in the patient population such as disease state, obesity, prior surgery and other comorbidities as well as appropriate near-term and long-term clinical outcomes. They also consider diversity and surgeon experience and practice patterns. As da Vinci is adopted in gynecology and general surgery, where a range of surgical approaches exist from open surgery to other forms of minimally invasive surgery, careful segmentation of patient surgeon population is important. A couple of colorectal studies published this quarter are good examples of using an appropriate set of patients and procedures. Unlike rectal resections, where open surgery remains the most common procedure, right colectomies are often performed laparoscopically. The studies of various types of right colectomy and broad patient populations have noted high rates of complications. We believe there is an opportunity for robotics to improve upon these outcomes. One study is a meta-analysis by Dr. Shu in studies and colleagues from the Shandong Cancer Hospital published in the World Journal of Surgical Oncology, which concludes “compared to laparoscopic right colectomy, robotic right colectomy was associated with reduced estimate of blood loss, produced post operative complications, longer operative times and a significantly faster recovery of bowel function.” The second study published in Surgical Endoscopy by Dr. Trusturi and colleagues, noted that intra-corporeal anastomosis in right colectomy is associated with improved clinical outcomes. It remains uncommon in laparoscopic procedures due to its technical difficulty. The study showed that cohort of patients undergoing robotic right colectomies with intra-corporeal anastomosis, recovered more quickly compared to laparoscopic cohorts with both intracorporeal and extracorporeal anastomosis. While there are over 8000 peer-reviewed clinical studies on robotic surgery, many of which support the value of our technology, we wanted to take a moment to highlight future clinical initiatives in which we are participating. We are working with surgical societies, including support of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, Clinical Outcomes Registry for cancer procedures, as well as a national registry for ventral hernia repair. In addition to supporting research, during the quarter we also expanded our support of Society Fellowship Trainings for both the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons. Turning back to research, we are supporting a number of multi-center clinical studies, including studies on rectal resection, single site cholecystectomy, thoracic resections and benign hysterectomies. We were also supporting national database reviews looking at outcomes from a population health perspective for rectal resection, thoracic resection, and benign hysterectomy. This concludes my remarks and I thank you for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2014 in pro forma terms. As Marshall mentioned, our GAAP financial results and pro forma reconciliations are available on our website. Starting with procedures, on our last call we estimated full year 2014 procedure growth of between 5% and 8%, above the approximately 523,000 procedures performed in 2013. Now based upon trends described earlier on the call, we are increasing our 2014 procedure growth guidance to a range of between 8% and 9%. Consistent with our recent calls, we will not be providing revenue guidance. Moving on to gross profit margin. Our Q3 2014 gross profit margin was 200 basis points lower than Q2. Certain charges to Q3 2014 cost of sales that Marshall described earlier on the call were non-recurring in nature. We estimate that these non-recurring items accounted for about three quarters of the sequential decline. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon product mix and systems production volume. Operating expenses. Last quarter we forecast full year operating expenses to grow between 10% and 13% above 2013 levels. Now based upon the timing of certain expenses, we expect to grow our operating expenses between 9% and 11% above 2013 levels. We expect 2014 non-cash stock compensation to be towards the lower end of the $170 million to $180 million range forecast on our previous call. We expect other income, excluding the impact of the Q2 impairment charge, to total between $12 million and 13 million. With regard to income tax, we expect our pro forma based tax rate for the balance of 2014 to fall within a range of between 27.5% and 29% of pretax income. Our current estimate is directionally lower than our expectations earlier in the year, driven by the geographic mix of our pretax income. Note that the pro forma tax rate tends to run above the GAAP tax rate, driven by the geographic mix of the pro forma items. Our Q3 2014 diluted share count decreased to 36.9 million shares, reflecting the full quarter impact of our accelerated share buyback completed in Q2. We estimate our Q4 diluted share count to range between 36.9 and 37.1 million shares. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: Thanks everybody and then for taking the questions. I want to start on procedure volumes, given Calvin’s outlook that you provided for the balance of the year. And I’m just hoping you could help us understand the balance of the year and the context where you done year-to-date. I guess specifically this guidance now implies 6% to 10% growth for the fourth quarter. Maybe you could just frame for us what’s happening to the assumption at the bottom end, then what’s happening in the assumptions at the high end, and why we would see -- why we wouldn’t see a continued trajectory from what we’re seeing year-to-date?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I can help you over there. As you mentioned, we are three quarter off the way through the year. Q3 rounded up to 10% as we described. And on a year-to-date basis, we are also rounding up to 9%. It has a lot to do with the numbers. You are three quarters away through the year, but the fact is in order to get a 10% procedure range, let’s say you would have to do an excess of 12% in the fourth quarter. And based upon the trajectories and the procedures that we’ve seen in our projections, it’s just not we’re expecting at this time.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And maybe on the topic of total revenue. And maybe Gary you could just sort of comment on the overall operating environment, I mean the data points thus far around the hospital CapEx continuum look to be coming together a little bit more favorably than where we were starting the year. And I think some of the concerns that if Europe don’t look to necessarily play themselves out as expected. So maybe you should help us understand what’s happening in the broader operating environment and what it will take for you to get more confident in the forward view?
Gary Guthart: Yes. As we look at the systems sales side, as we described before really, we can describe our environment and that is really driven by three things. One is interest in acquiring technologies for existing customers and Xi is being well received and so we are seeing some interesting trade-ins. The second piece has been adding capacity if there are existing, possible existing customer and that will have to do with what their procedure mix and procedure growth looks like. And the last one is starting new programs. And in terms of looking at global capital equipment environments, you are probably in a better position to comment on that than we. In general, we are hospital, finances looks stronger that gives them flexibility. Turning to Europe, what we have talked about before is really true, it’s not a smooth distribution of customers. There are those who are interested in the most highly featured products and there are those who are interested in real price sensitive offerings. And so we see a little bit of both in that marketplace. So one size doesn’t fit all.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: And then maybe very specifically to your business, we started the year I think what somebody would call a very turbulent set of events and you are talking about I think your language was intended consequences around the Affordable Care Act and some of the gyration and procedure volumes and what was happening at the hospital, particularly the evolution of your technology, that’s followed last year which was an adjustment period around utilization rates. Like where are we more broadly speaking just in the adoption of your technology and are we close to the point where you think we are back on a positive trajectory, positive sustainable trajectory?
Gary Guthart: Speaking first to procedures, I think the procedure performance speaks for itself. We are seeing early adoption in several general surgery procedure categories. I think that’s a positive. As that grows and matures, I think, we'll see whether it continues and how fast it accelerates in general reports on things like ventral hernia and colorectal surgery have been really strong and leave us encouraged. I think with regards to the early impact of Affordable Care Act, we saw some uncertainty with regard to hospital finances as to how that would impact them and that uncertainty put them into a pause mode as it related to us. As I think they get better clarity than that that allows them to plan a little bit and looking forward should smooth things out. What will actually be like as time plays out we’ll have to see.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Go ahead please.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Hey. Thanks. Gary, I’m just wondering if you can elaborate on the Sp delay, just a function have you guys doing more trial work? I’m just kind of wondering what the rationale there was?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. The biggest reason for us to move it out a little bit was actually some of the positive things we’ve learned from our Xi launch. We are seeing customer feedback on Xi, that is really strong and some things that they particularly appreciate and as we do our customer valuations on Sp and look to integrate those things, there is a few things that we’d like to bring over from one to the other and we made a decision to do so.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Okay. And then, Marshall, can you comment a little bit more on some of the drivers of the gross margin softness? I mean, I know you talked about the stapler stop using some of these other dynamics? Is there anyway to kind of quantify the various costs and I guess, the underline question is, where do we reach a low watermark on margins?
Marshall Mohr:  Yeah. So the -- what we commented on with -- there is about a 200 basis point decline in gross margins. I will attribute three quarters of that to unusual items in the quarter a you mentioned that the stepper stop use. The -- we also had a scope recall and then we had some cost associated with our acquisition of Japan, the Japanese distribution business and the accounting around that. So, I guess, I would say that there is a portion of it though that is just part of the normal margin and reflects new product and new product has lower margins to start and we’ll continue to try to drive those down overtime. As far as where we’re going in the future, I think, Calvin gave you the projection for Q4. We’re not going to give you 2015 but you get a sense as to where we were this quarter.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Okay. And then last one China, nice number there. Can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of the trend there, are we are at kind of an inflection point? I think, up till now you had only 26 systems or so in China? So just maybe talk about some of the drivers?
Gary Guthart: I think, we’re in our first phase. Long-term, we think there is real opportunity in China but in the near-term, I think, there are a lot of steps to building a sustainable business there. It’s -- in terms of feel and approach. We feel little bit like our conversations around Japan. I think there is an element of having a deeper presence in China of both direct and potentially with others and requiring a build out to have sustained growth. So I think it’s a goods first step. Certainly a positive, but I don’t think it is signaling us strong inflection point, I would not assume that.
Marshall Mohr:  And that brought our total systems in China ending the quarter up to 36 systems.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Wise with Stifel. Go ahead please.
Rick Wise - Stifel: Good afternoon, everybody. Starting with the Xi, Gary, on last quarter, it felt like you all were pleased and maybe a bit surprised by the strong trend system placement trend? Is Xi now this quarter the same kind of surprise there, is the rollout where you expected at this point or again are you -- is it a little better you might have thought?
Gary Guthart: I think we’re pleased with where we’re on the Xi rollout. I think that we are getting feedback that I think is what we expected in some parts of the market in terms of multi-port access and multi-quadrant access and we’re surprised and pleased by, I think, the broad-based nature of commentary in terms of urologist and GY oncologists, who are find value in it, perhaps, more than we had anticipated. So, I think, we’re continuing the feeling and the trend that we saw in the second quarter.
Rick Wise - Stifel: Okay. And back to the stapler, it just maybe one by two quickly. So you hope to resolve the stapler issues this year? I think you said, you weren’t going to be specific, but is it in 2014 and when we reflect on fourth quarter procedure trends, does that -- does the recall or have any impact on those procedures or a meaningful impact, how do we think about that?
Gary Guthart: We haven’t given you a date that will put it back on the market. We think we have root cause well-identified and are in the midst of validating solutions. When those are validated when we have them in our hands and they are done, the validation is done, we’ll report to our customers and to you. I don’t have a timeframe for you. Yet, having said that, I think that the teams are making good progress, both understanding where we are and what the possible solutions are. In terms of modeling procedure impact, a little hard to say, I think, that it's certainly some drag, very hard to know how big the drag is.
Rick Wise - Stifel: Okay. And just last for me on the da Vinci prostatectomy side. It sounds like things are stabilizing. Can you just give us little more color there, Gary, just I mean what’s happening? Do you think the market is sort of set to remain stable or actually grow? How are you thinking about and how would you have us think about it? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: It’s a little bit hard to know based on one quarter of return to growth here, so what happens in the next quarter and the next one after that, hard to predict. It’s -- we have seen in past quarters that when there is an increase and things like watchful waiting. At some period of time after that you see a bolus of patients come out of watchful waiting and into definitive treatment of one type or another as some subset of that watchful waiting cohort has their cancer progress and maybe that we’ll have to wait a couple of quarters to see if that indeed is the case.
Rick Wise - Stifel: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go now to Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Good afternoon. Can you talk a little about what you’re seeing in terms of the expenses because you talked about trimming that back a little based on timing. Are those things are likely to drop in 2015 so we could actually see operating margin go down a bit because I think most of us have modeled it flat, kind of through the end of ’15?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. We’ve been talking about investments we’re making this year and we clearly believe strongly in our opportunities and have been investing. We did take the guidance range down a bit on expenses this year. It has mostly to do with the timing of some of the hiring activities. As we move forward into next year, obviously we will be providing that guidance commentary on the next call. But that being said, in the longer-term we really wouldn't expect to make the types of operating expense investments in future years that we made in 2014 relative to revenue growth trends.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Okay. Great. That’s helpful. Thank you. Gary, is there any comments relative to the approval we saw a few weeks ago for base of tongue resections. Is that for combination used with UPPP for like our sleep apnea case or is that sort of an entrée to the ENT space broadly?
Gary Guthart: It’s the next step in clearances for ENT surgeons. It is not a sleep apnea claim and the company does not take that position. It really is as it has been published which is a clearance to allow surgeons to do resection of benign tongue-based issue as they deem appropriate. Where they take it from there, I think we’ll have to see in future quarters?
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Okay. And can you characterize as best you can given the confounding nature of the Stapler pullback. How the general surgeon procedure growth trajectory as compared to prior procedure growth trajectory? They have tended to parallel each other except some of the recent ones are faster? Are those more encouraging than you would've expected?
Gary Guthart: In terms of stepping back, I think as you look at the segments of growth and general surgery, the hernia growth is still early in its life cycle. But it’s been on the faster side. In terms of hernia growth, if you look at separate rectal and colon, rectal so deep in the pelvis has been the one that is most utilizing the stapler and is the one that for which I think the surgeons are most wanting it back quickly. That has been -- growth is been consistent with what we've seen in past adoptions and that’s one we watch pretty closely for any changes with regard to the Stapler. The solution to the Stapler problem is really straightforward, which is identify the issues, get the solutions validated and bring it back to market, we will do that scientifically and carefully but that’s the path forward. As you look at colon resection, that growth has been positive for us also. It’s a multifaceted procedure. It’s not just one thing. We do see Stapler use in colon resection but not in all segments. And so it’s kind of a mixed story in that one. 
Ben Andrew - William Blair:  Okay. And then finally from me, when might we see the first of some of the clinical work being done in Japan for expanded indications?
Gary Guthart: The beginning in terms of reimbursement, those trials have initiated already. I think first enrollments have already occurred this month.
Ben Andrew - William Blair:  When might we see results of those? Is that 2015…
Gary Guthart:  That will play out over multiple quarters in terms of when they start to publish, we’ll have to talk about that as we get greater clarity on their timelines.
Ben Andrew - William Blair:  Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Tao Levy with Wedbush Securities. Go ahead please.
Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities: Hi, good afternoon.
Gary Guthart: Hi Tao.
Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities: Hi. So couples of quick question under the single-site, the wristed device, that you recently got approval. The uptake in that market, is it possible that you can start to see benign hysterectomy sort of go flat to positive as a result of that technology and basically what I’m getting at is -- is that going to go after the laparoscopic patient population or still the open patient population that you normally talked about?
Patrick Clingan: Hey, Tao, it’s Patrick. First off, we were excited about the level of enthusiasm and interest that gynecologists probably have shown towards adopting single incision surgery. The initial case series that have been done since the product was approved have been seamlessly integrated and surgeons have reported positive feedback to us about what they are able to achieve with the device. Relative to what happens in the overall market, this has been a market that has been in decline for a while now as payers have looked for alternative treatments rather than surgery, putting pressure on the overall number of benign hysterectomies performed. But we’ll see where we go from here. But we’ll definitely try to use the device to restore our rate of growth. But it’s just too earlier to comment on the trajectory at this stage.
Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities: Is there any difference between the gall bladder sort of approach or experience, obviously different types of surgeon and what you could see in gynecology? 
Gary Guthart: 
 :
Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities: Great. And then just lastly, the approval in Korea, that’s one of your larger markets and now you are direct there, I think maybe a year or two ago. How -- any expectations to how quickly that market get start to purchase excise of sums?
Gary Guthart:  I believe given the clearance that they can start to purchase product as soon as we start shipping it. And I think we have intentions to ship it before the end of the quarter.
Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities:  Okay. But the interest is there, I guess is kind of with us? 
Gary Guthart:  Yes. We have customers who have an interest.
Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities:  Okay.
Gary Guthart: Thank you, Tao.
Operator:  Thank you. And next we have Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Go ahead please.
Bob Hopkins - Bank of America:  Hi thanks. Can you hear me okay?
Gary Guthart:  We can.
Bob Hopkins - Bank of America: Great. Good afternoon. And just a couple of quick things. First off, I noticed in your quarter I think you guys have confirmed that there has been a change in your Head of Sales in the U.S. And I was just wondering if there is any color you are willing to provide on that change. I’m sure folks in this call -- it will be interesting to hear if there is any commentary from you guys.
Gary Guthart: We’ve had a couple of changes in our leadership team over the last couple of quarters. I think just standing back as the marketplace changes out in the United States as well as the company needs a change. I think, for both the company and for individuals, people look at what they want to do and what their skills are and what’s the match? We have been the beneficiaries of a really strong team and we also have a strong bench. So for those who moved on we wish them well and expect them to do great things in their next engagement. Having said that, I think we also have a really good team here. And so it’s natural in evolution of any company, you will look out at what the needs of the organization are and what peoples’ long-term needs are, what they do and we do and so these transitions occur. I think we have a great team. We are confident in our opportunity and we are confident in their ability.
Bob Hopkins - Bank of America: Great. So the other two things I want to ask you about really quickly is one for you, Gary and one on the finance side. And Gary, I was just wondering if you could just give us your thoughts on, how your thoughts on SP have changed since you first announced the technology? I’m not asking about the timing because you’ve already addressed that. I’m just asking about your thoughts on the, kind of long-term market opportunity for that technology. Things like, could this system ultimately be competitive with traditional laproscopic surgery in addition to some of the other things that you’ve talked about. So that’s a question for you. And then on the finance side just to get it out of the way, I just wanted to be clear on the comments on operating expense growth as we look forward. Were you suggesting that relative to the double-digit growth in OpEx that we might see this year that you wouldn’t expect double-digit growth going forward or was that the message I just wanted to be clear?
Gary Guthart: Okay. Let me take them in order and I think I got them both. With regard to SP, I think there is -- just standing back on the introduction of new technology, there tends to be a trend for folks to overestimate what they do in near term and underestimate what they do in the long-term. And so I look at SP and I think it has a lot of long-term potential. It is fundamentally a technology that enters the body through a small entry point, brings in instruments in a parallel way and works with high precision in tight spots. And as you sit down and talk to surgeons and I’ve spoken with many, many, I have personally as well as our team. I think there are lot of possibility as to where there can go and take it. What that looks like and whether it displaces one alternative or another depends entirely on what part of the body it’s applied to. There are some places that are really straightforward areas to explore that are just set up well for this type of technology. And so things like Transoral surgery or transrectal or transvaginal, these are areas that hold a lot of promise. Having said that, bring a new technology market, you want to make sure you do it in a way that brings value early and establishes value for your customer, gives high value patient outcomes and value to the surgeons and hospitals who adopted and so how we evolve that is something that we work through in the next several quarters. And as we get closer, we will describe it too. With regard to OpEx growth, speaking after ’15, we will give your thoughts on ‘15 in the next call. But longer term, we don’t expect that we will ramp expenses highly out of sync with the growth and revenue. We think longer term working out a few years that we have an opportunity for both stabilization and then later leverage, so that’s how we are thinking about it.
Bob Hopkins - Bank of America: Great. Very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ross Muken with ISI Group. Go ahead, please.
Vijay Kumar - ISI Group: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is Vijay and I had a question. I guess last quarter, Gary, lot of questions on instrument accessories and I guess you guys were pretty sort of, I guess had this view that procedures for up and you expected that number to come back up right. And I guess then going forward when you look at that, you had this dynamic of a general surgery, which had higher pull through but then you also have hernia and coli is sort of growing. How should we think about the normalized, I guess longer term I&A revenues for procedure?
Gary Guthart: Let me give you a kind of a directional pointer and then, I think Calvin, maybe a little help on the modeling side. I think directionally, remember the general surgery is a cluster of different procedures and doesn’t out model as one thing. And just the few that you mentioned have really strong differences in I&A per procedures. So you think about rectal case, cancer case uses staplers will be on the high end of I&A per procedure, hernia somewhere in the middle. Hernia is also in itself a cluster of procedure. It’s not one thing. So ventral hernia is different than inguinal hernia and there are different techniques in each of those, so that the cost basis for each one of those subsets maybe a little bit different. And than Single-Site cholecystectomy is at the lower end of our revenue per procedure and so then you start modeling this out. It all has to do with mix in growth rate and that’s when it gets turned over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Yeah. I mean, I think you laid it out pretty well. This is an average, right. The average I&A revenue per procedure and our message is really just be aware of the average. You have got a widening and widening gap in the actual per procedure on the complex side and the less complex side. So, I don’t think we have any specific commentary whether it should be increasing or decreasing. It really depends on really, which factors win the day on this thing and you can be successful in any scenario as far as that goes.
Gary Guthart: Yeah, I will make a last comment on that point. We feel comfortable with pricing in those procedures. We think it’s appropriate for us and for the customer, and we think the margin structure is right in those things. So it’s really looking out at what the mix is going to be rather than whether the company has to make a change.
Vijay Kumar - ISI Group: Great. And I guess, I had a one follow-up on procedure side and I think you guys have been pretty consistent when you were talking about this changing healthcare dynamic and increased seasonality and back half pick up. And when you look at that guidance of 8% to 9%, I guess at the high end you’re sort of getting in flattish Q-on-Q. Is that a reasonable assumption? Or is there a belief that given this exacerbated seasonality, Q4 should be better than Q3?
Gary Guthart:  The simple way I think to answer that is, we are all together experiencing what seasonality is going to be like after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I think nobody has been through it yet. So we are -- have our estimates. We have given the guidance based on those estimates, but I think we are all just going to have to see and gain some experience together.
Vijay Kumar - ISI Group: Thanks, guys. I’ll step back in the queue. Congrats on the queue.
Gary Guthart: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Go ahead, please.
Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners:  Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. I just want to turn back to the stapler stop use for a movement. Can you just characterize whether or not or the feedback that you’ve gotten in the field? Is it a matter of an issue for the moment not using the Stapler, obviously it’s not available, but the second it comes back, it gets reused? Or is there an actual hesitation in your customer base amongst rectal resection users that they are concerned about the safety issues from an ongoing basis? Or is it just a very transient issue?
Gary Guthart: First characterize where we are, we have asked customers to stop using it until we have identified and given them further instructions about what and how to handle it. We have taken a reserve with regards to inventory should we want to send them replacements depending on what the conclusions of the cause and validations are. I think that the customer sentiment around it has been, they understand our request. It is quite a conservative request, three malfunctions over greater than 10,000 fires. They have viewed this as an understandable. And so I think that we have not seen -- I have not seen any deep confidence been shaken. We have many requests to hurry up and bring it back. I think they want to use it. I think it’s differentiated relative to other products that they use. And so that’s what we are working on.
Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners: Okay. And can you maybe just describe what they are doing in the mean time? Does it actually decrease the utilization? I mean, it sounds like you are more hesitant there. How are they managing to not having access to the stapler?
Gary Guthart: Yeah. It depends on what the case is. If it’s a low rectal case and they can do it with the manual stapler, they will try that. If it’s very deep, they may have to use a laparotomy rather than doing it only basically. So there is a real variety depending on what the patient characteristics are.
Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners: Great. And then if I could just ask one more on, just as we look out into your new product initiatives, obviously Sp is getting delayed. I didn’t catch whether you provided a timeline for when that might be delayed until. And then also are there other new products that we can potentially expect to hear about making progress on? I am thinking about things in that brochure that we saw at stages like the rotating bed and where are you on some of those additional features? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: With regard to commercialization timing with Sp, we are not giving you updated timing. We do expect clinical use of Xi compatible Sp in '15. With regards to other things that we have been working on, there is another set of Xi instrumentation, Phase 2 instrumentation that we will describe as it goes through the process. We are making progress on an Xi integrated bed. We don’t have the timeline to describe to you at this time, but in future quarters we will. The pipeline is quite robust and we continue to walk down it.
Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We have a question now from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Well, thank you, excuse me and Gary just two quick ones here. On Japan, you talked about the clinical development program, are you still -- is it still the company’s thinking that 2016, is it good estimate for reimbursement in Japan?
Gary Guthart: We are working towards 2016 on a couple of fronts. It is as yet uncertain. We don’t have of course final approval from anybody on that timeline, but we are working toward that end.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And nothing has changed in that front. It sounds like the clinical development program is on track.
Gary Guthart: Well, it’s a dynamic conversation. So I wouldn’t characterize it as everything is solid and locked in stone. I think that’s a set of conversations that has been going on and we will continue to do so, but that’s the nature of these kind of conversations in Japan.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: I think Gary just if you think about the last several quarters adjusting for the second quarter, where obviously Xi was going to be stronger in the U.S. It does look like O-U.S. net system placements were stronger than the U.S. Do you think these three quarters justifies the trend and on a go forward, it’s likely that O-U.S. net placements are higher than U.S placements?
Gary Guthart: Hard to say. I think a couple of things. I’d say that on the one hand, we are earlier in total market adoption in some of our U.S countries and we think that those are real markets and we are the pursuit. And so if they go where we hope they go, then we will see increased spending there. In the U.S. of course, we have a bigger install base so the conversation tends to be somewhat around new technologies and other things they want to do. I think as you look over years and not quarters I’d expect that the O-U.S. represents a strong growth time for us.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you very much.
Gary Guthart: Thank you. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient benefit by providing surgical outcomes, by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. This concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months’ time.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Intuitive Surgical Q2 2014 Earnings Release Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And also as a reminder, today’s teleconference is being recorded. And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead Sir.
Calvin Darling: Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical’s second quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Director of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2014 and 10-Q filed on April 25, 2014. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC’s EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today’s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results. Patrick will discuss procedures and clinical highlights, then I’ll provide our updated financial outlook for 2014. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us on the call today. I’m encouraged by several trends relative to the first quarter of the year. First, global procedures grew 8% on a sequential basis and 9% year-over-year. Our newest platform, the da Vinci Xi surgical system was launched in the quarter, and our customers’ reception for it has been very positive. Also during the quarter, we strengthened our direct presence in both Japan and Europe. Turning to the United States, procedure growth improved over the first quarter led by growth in colorectal procedures, single-site, and early growth in hernia repair. Hernia repair is a broad category consisting of several procedure types and techniques for multiple underlying conditions. For some of these repairs, the da Vinci systems provide enhanced visualization and dexterity during the dissection and reconstruction phases of the procedure. We are very encouraged by this growth and we’ll pursue those opportunity in coming quarters. Within our gynecology segment, negative trends in da Vinci use in US hysterectomy in the first quarter moderated in the second. That said, the macro environment around US hysterectomy appears unchanged and overall performance in hysterectomy is likely better understood by viewing the first half of 2014 as a whole versus a quarterly breakout. Overall, general surgery interest and utilization in United States is positive. Patrick will provide further procedure detail later in the call. Capital placements in the United States grew sequentially from 45 in the first quarter to 61 in the second driven by the introduction of our da Vinci Xi system. Surgeon and institutional interest in da Vinci Xi has been strong with positive feedback from experienced users within many different specialties, as well as those new to da Vinci systems. The capital environment for robotic surgery remains constrained in the United States with customers evaluating their capital priorities broadly. With regard to our Xi system specifically, we anticipate increasing interest as additional clearances are obtained in experience with the product growth. In Europe, procedure growth moderated relative to the first quarter. Growth rates in the quarter were balanced between urology, gynecology and general surgery. Some of the slowing growth may be attributed to fewer working days in the quarter compared with prior year. As expected, capital sales in Europe have been impacted in the near term by the introduction of da Vinci Xi. Capital sales cycles are typically longer in Europe, and the introduction of the new systems creates some delay as customers evaluate our new offering. Longer term we expect growing interest in our Xi system in Europe. We also expect continued interest in our Xi system for price sensitive customers. We continue to invest in our sales organization as well as scientific affairs to deepen our European capabilities. Turning to Asia, procedure trends have been healthy with growth centered on cancer surgeries and urology, and general surgery. We are pleased to have completed a transaction with our Japanese distribution partner to enable Intuitive to interact more closely with customers in Japan and we welcome members of the adopted team to Intuitive. Direct interactions with customers, surgical societies and government agencies in Japan are essential to long-term growth of robotic surgery. And we look forward to serving the Japanese market meaningfully in coming years. As you know, we continue to work with multiple parties in pursuit of additional procedure reimbursement for da Vinci in Japan. Capital sales in Asia were lower than prior quarters impacted by the introduction of da Vinci Xi in the U.S., as well as constrained procedural reimbursement in Japan. We have submitted applications for Xi clearance in Japan and Korea, and we’ll work with government bodies in subsequent quarters during the review process. As we have described in our earnings release, several non-cash charges make it valuable to understand our financial performance on a pro forma basis. Taken together our operating performance in the quarter is as follows. Worldwide procedures grew 9% of the prior year. We sold 96 systems in the quarter, down from 143 in Q2 of 2013 and up from 87 in Q1. Total non-GAAP revenue in the quarter was $507 million, down from $579 million in Q2 of 2013 and up from $490 million in Q1 of 2014. Non-GAAP operating profit in the quarter was $196 million comprising 39% of non-GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.70 compared with $4.60 in Q2 of 2013, and $3.50 in Q1. Speaking of product contribution margins, we expect capital pressures on hospitals in most regions to continue. Given our new product introduction cycle for systems and broader market conditions, we expect capital margins to remain below prior year levels. However, overtime we expect recurring revenue margins to improve as new product volumes increase and we benefit from efficiencies in our supply chain services and product architectures. Turning to new products, we’ve received FDA clearance for our Xi Vessel Sealer and are working through the clearance process with Xi Stapler and Xi Firefly in United States and other countries. These advanced technologies are an important step in filling in the Xi offering. Our Xi architecture simplifies implementation and improves performance for our advanced instruments, and we look forward to their introduction around the world. We have submitted our five 10-K application for our single-site wrist needle drivers, and are working through the clearance process. Pilot product performance for the wrist needle driver for single-site is compelling. We expect it will add significant capability and efficiencies for single-site surgeons. Lastly, we continue to make progress in refining our SP platform. I’m excited and encouraged by the progress the technical teams are making. This will be a multi-core development that will be paced by technical and regulatory milestones. In summary, we are passionately pursuing the long-term opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and are focused on the following. First, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery using da Vinci worldwide. Second, building da Vinci capability and supporting its use in general surgery. Third, disciplined execution in our new product launches. And finally continuing to invest in our capabilities in key international markets. Now I’ll pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. I’ll be describing our results on a pro forma basis which excludes the impact of our Xi trade-in programs, legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation and intangible assets amortizations, and invested impairments. We’re providing pro forma information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my statements. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma on GAAP results on our website so that there is no confusion. Pro forma second quarter revenue was $507 million, down 12% compared with $579 million in the second quarter of 2013 and up 3% from last quarter. Procedures for the second quarter grew approximately 9% compared with second quarter of 2013, and were up approximately 8% compared with last quarter. Procedure highlights will be discussed by Patrick. Pro forma revenue excludes the impact of offers made to customers to trade-in their recently purchased Si products to newly introduced Xi products. At the time of announcing the da Vinci Xi surgical system, we offered our first grade of customers in the U.S. the ability to trade their recently purchased da Vinci Si surgical systems for da Vinci Xi surgical systems. In the second quarter we obtained CE Mark in Europe in the similar trade-in offers to certain European customers that had recently purchased da Vinci Si systems. These trade-in programs often provide our customers with the opportunity to exchange certain recently purchased da Vinci Si instruments and accessories for da Vinci Xi instruments and accessories. As a result of these offers, we reserved $26 million of U.S. revenue in the first quarter, and reserved $6 million of European revenue in the second quarter. And these customers accept or decline their trade-in offers, we refine our estimates of the revenue reserves. In the second quarter we reversed $10 million of the first quarter system revenue reserve, approximately reflecting more trade-outs completed and partially reflecting refinement of the number of customers that we expect to accept our offerings. As I’ve stated, pro forma results exclude the impact of these revenue reserves. Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue of $262 million was down 1% compared with the second quarter of 2013, and was up 2% compared with the first quarter of 2014. The decrease relative to the second quarter of 2013 reflected lower stocking orders associated with newer system sales. The increase relative to the first quarter reflects increased procedures and number of stocking orders associated with higher systems partially offset by customer buying patterns and fewer sales of energy generator units in single-site starter kits. Keep in mind that the Xi incorporates are energy generator units. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,830 per procedure compared with $2,020 in the second quarter of 2013 and $1,930 last quarter. The decrease relative to the prior year primarily reflects lower stocking order revenue, the decrease relative to the prior quarter reflects customer buying patterns and fewer energy units and single-sit starter kit sales. Pro forma results or pro forma systems revenue of $138 million decreased 36% compared with the second quarter of 2013 and increased 6% compared with the first quarter of 2014. 96 systems were placed in the second quarter excluding the four Xi’s trade-in for Si’s. We saw more hospitals finance their da Vinci systems in the second quarter with 37% being financed compared to 11% in the first quarter, and 20% for all of 2013. We are participating in that trend financing 10 systems of which 3 were structured as operating leases. Enabling system placements will drive greater procedures of recurring revenue. Globally, our systems ASP for the second quarter was $1.5 million, roughly equal to last year, and slightly higher than the $1.48 million last quarter. The increase compared to the last quarter was driven by product mix partially offset by geographic mix. 50 of the 96 systems placed during the second quarter were da Vinci Xi models. We sold 5 Si’s in the quarter compared with 13 last quarter. In U.S. we placed 61 systems in the first quarter compared with 90 systems in the second quarter of 2013, and 45 systems in the first quarter of 2014. The decline in U.S. system placements relative to last year reflects the impact of lower procedure growth, and ongoing macro factors that are impacting hospital capital decisions. The increase relative to the first quarter reflects seasonality and acceptance of our Xi system. Outside the U.S., we sold 35 systems in the second quarter, including 19 into Europe and 5 into Japan, compared with 53 into international markets in the second quarter of 2013, which included 21 into Europe and 20 into Japan, and 42 systems into international markets last quarter which included 14 into Europe and 19 into Japan. Second quarter system sales also included five into France and three into Germany. Lower second quarter 2014 systems sales relative to last year and last quarter primarily reflect lower system unit sales in Japan but also reflect delays in purchasing as customers await local market approval of Xi. The decrease in system sales in Japan reflect the high installed base relative to only having one national reimbursement prostatectomy. The Xi product not yet being available as we work through regulatory approval process. In June, we entered into new agreement to transition direct sales and marketing responsibilities in Japan from our distributor to our wholly owned subsidiary. The total transaction cost was expected to be approximately $70 million of which $50 million is a sign to goodwill and the remainder is a sign to intangibles that will amortize over varying periods. We expect that overtime the total cost associated with managing this direct channel and the costs of intangible amortization will be absorbed without a material impact in net income. As Gary indicated, the completion of the agreement enables direct interaction with our customers, surgical societies and government agencies. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margins was 69.2% in the second quarter of 2014 compared with 71.8% for the second quarter of 2013 and 70.2% for the first quarter of 2014. Our lower margin percentage reflects a higher mix of new product sales including the da Vinci Xi systems, and relative for last year, costs spread over lower production levels. Margins on newly launched products would typically be lower than our mature products reflecting vendor pricing on low volumes, temporary tooling costs and other start-up costs. However, overtime as volumes increase and we refine the manufacturing process and the product, we would expect to see improvement in the margins of these newer products although they may not ultimately reach the level of our matured products. In the first quarter we recorded a pretax charge of $67 million to reflect the estimated costs of settling a number of product liability legal claims against the company. During the second quarter, we recorded an additional $10 million charge reflecting additional claims. These claims relate to alleged complications from surgeries performed with certain versions of monopolar cautery scissor or MCS instruments that included an MCS tip cover accessory that was the subject of a market withdrawal in 2012, and surgeries that were performed with MCS instruments that were the subject of a recall in 2013. Our estimate of the anticipated cost of settling these claims is based on negotiations with attorneys for patients who have participated in the mediation process that the company established in conjunction with the polling agreement. Our estimates will be refined as we proceed through the negotiation process. Pro forma operating expenses which exclude reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expenses and amortization of intangibles were $155 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared with $152 million for the second quarter of 2013, and $155 million for the first quarter of 2014. The increase in pro forma operating expense in the second quarter relative to the first quarter reflects increased commissions associated with higher revenue and costs associated with new product launches. We expect the operating expenses to continue to ramp in the back half of the year primarily associated with international expansion, particularly in Japan and Europe, and new product launches. In the quarter we recorded a $4 million charge to other income to write down an investment in early stage company. The investment originally enabled a license for technology, otherwise other income reflects interest on our cash and investments, our pro forma results exclude this charge. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.1% compared with 28.6% for the second quarter of 2013 and 26.8% last quarter. Our pro forma net income was $140 million or $3.73 per share, compared with $189 million or $4.63 per share for the second quarter of 2013, and $139 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2014. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easy comparison of our financial results in business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $512 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared with $579 million for the second quarter of 2013, and $465 million for the first quarter of 2014. GAAP net income was $104 million or $2.77 per share for the second quarter of 2014, compared with $159 million or $3.90 per share for the second quarter of 2013, and $44 million or $1.13 per share for the first quarter of 2014. At the end of the quarter with cash and investments of $2 billion, down from $3 billion as of March 31, 2014, the decrease was primarily driven by $1 billion used during the second quarter for repurchase company stock on an accelerated basis and our acquisition of distribution rights in Japan, partially offset by cash generated from operations. The majority of the shares repurchased under our ASR program which amounts to approximately 2.5 million shares have been received and retired, the remaining shares if any under the program will be received and retired in early November although they could be received earlier if the ASR program is ended sooner. We do not plan to repurchase any additional shares until this ASR program is closed out. And with that I’d like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over procedure and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan: Thanks, Marshall. Q2 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 9%, with U.S. procedures growing 7% and international procedures growing 17%. Stepping back and looking at the first half of 2014, U.S. procedures grew 5%. The softness in Q1 and the improvement in Q2 were impacted by a changing macro environment, including the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We believe our U.S. procedure growth is best viewed by looking at the first half in aggregate. Q2 GYN procedure growth improved compared Q1 though we believe the low single-digit decline in procedure growth we experienced during the first half is likely representative of an overall rate of decline in benign gynecologic surgical volumes. Since we do not sell power morcellators and they do not attach to our systems, we are unable to precisely measure the impact April’s FDA advisory specific to power morcellators may have had on our Q2 procedures. However, the advisory appears to be meaningfully impacting myomectomies while the effect on hysterectomies appear to have been muted. We believe that for many patients surgeons will not have to choose between minimally invasive surgery and morcellation. Alternatives for tissue extraction, including the use of da Vinci surgery exist. Similar to last quarter, single-site hysterectomy continues to be a source of growth in U.S. GYN procedures, though offer small base. As we highlighted in a press release yesterday, a web-based patient satisfaction survey of over 6,000 hysterectomy patients sponsored by Intuitive in the Hyster Sisters patient support group recently published in the Interactive Journal of Medical Research found that robotic hysterectomy when compared to a abdominal, laparoscopic and vaginal hysterectomy was the only surgical modality that was an independent predictor of better patient experience, greater satisfaction, and willingness to recommended have the same procedure again. Moving onto U.S. general surgery. Adoption continues to be strong across a broad number of procedures. Colorectal procedure adoption remains solid following the broad launch of our Xi Stapler earlier this year. In addition to driving procedure growth, with customers adoption Stapler and Vessel Sealer, I&A for colorectal procedure has been increasing over the past few quarters. Single-site cholecystectomy continues to grow with adoption being driven by cosmetically sensitive commercially insured patients. As people look at I&A for procedure among a large number of high volume customers suggests that achieving little to no difference in material operating costs compared to laparoscopic instruments is reproducible and sustainable. Although there are additional general surgery procedures showing early signs of adoption, I want to take a moment to expand upon Gary’s comment about what we are seeing in hernia repair. Hernias occur in the abdomen pelvis, sometimes as a result of prior open surgical incisions. Open surgery remains the most common form of surgery for hernia repair. Looking specifically at ventral hernia’s that occur in the abdomen, [indiscernible] pain scores and difficulties associated with performing a laparoscopic repair has caused many surgeons to rely upon open surgery. To perform minimally invasive ventral hernia repair, instruments much reach back towards the abdominal wall to repair the defect which can present a challenge even for professional laparoscopists. Early surgeon feedback on the use of da Vinci for ventral hernia repair has been encouraging. These surgeons find ease of suturing and enhanced vision enables a minimally invasive repair that is similar to open surgery. It is worth noting that some surgeons reduced or eliminate fixation instruments with robotic surgery resulting in material operating costs that are similar between robotic and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. International procedure growth of 17% continues to be lead by global adoption of DDP and other urologic procedures with solid early contributions from GYN, oncology and general surgery. Compared to Q1 procedure growth of 24%, a number of small factors impacted the growth rate during the quarter. Relative to Q1, Q2 international procedure growth compares to a more difficult prior year competitor as international procedures grew 23% in Q2 of 2013 compared to 14% in Q1 2013. International procedure growth was also impacted by the mixed polled days in Europe. As we look forward, we expect an international procedure that maybe a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter as adoption is not uniform across all procedures and geographies. We continue to expect international procedure adoption to be a driver or procedure growth as the opportunity for da Vinci surgery and cancer and complex open urologic, gynecology and colorectal procedures is substantial. At the American Urological Association meeting in May, Dr. Murphy from Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia presented the results of an economic evaluation of robotic surgery sponsored by the Victorian Government. His evaluation included more than 5,000 patients from the state live database comparing outcomes and costs associated with open lap and robotic surgeries for prostate cancer. The analysis included direct costs associated with the surgery and post-operative care and concluded robotic assisted prostatectomy reduces heart stay [ph], blood transfusions and positive surgical margins in a public health system in Australia. In a case mix activity based funding model, the incremental cost of robotic assisted prostatectomy maybe offsets by reduced length of stay and blood transfusions when greater than 140 cases per year are performed. Just finding it similar to the U.K. nice recommendation to consider robotic surgery in the treatment of localized prostate cancer they found robotic prostatectomy cost effective in centers performing at least 150 procedures per year. In the debate over health spending, analysis of economic impacts of new technologies on specific procedures are an important tool. However, meaningful analysis requires a detailed understanding of clinical outcomes, patient populations, surgeon experience and skill variation, and actual costs to care for a patient across several alternative treatments. Studies that satisfy these criteria’s such as Dr. Murphy’s have been layered and those that overlook one or more of these elements do a dis-service to the healthcare community as a whole. Recently we had seen an increase in both careful economic studies by investigators who understand the need to take a population based in direct cost approach to assessment, as well as those that inappropriately select subset in analysis as the basis to draw broad conclusions. We encourage the healthcare community to demand rigor in these analysis. Those that do derive the clearest picture of how new technologies impact lives and the economics of those who use them. This concludes my remarks and I thank you for your time. I’ll now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Patrick. As Marshall describes, we are focusing our commentary towards non-GAAP pro forma results which exclude the impacts of significant non-cash expenses and certain non-recurring items. We believe that this enhances investor’s ability to asses our financial results. In order to provide historical context, we have posted summary leveled quarterly pro forma P&L metrics with GAAP reconciliation to the Investor Relations page of our website. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2014 in pro forma terms. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2014 procedure growth of between 2% and 8% above the approximately 523,000 procedures performed in 2013. Now based upon trends described earlier on the call, we are adjusting our 2014 procedure growth guidance to the higher end of this range, between 5% and 8%. Moving to revenues. Several factors continue to make it difficult in the near term for us to predict systems sales volumes. And as a consequence total revenue, specifically. We are currently in the process of obtaining US FDA, an international regulatory clearances for the excise versions of our Stapler and Firefly products, and the Xi system is not available in Japan, Korea, and other international markets. Customers evaluation of the da Vinci Xi and the timing of their system purchasing decisions maybe impacted as we work to expand the product and geographic clearances for the platform. Macro environmental issues impacting hospital, capital purchasing decision, the breadth and evolving nature of our procedure growth. Procedures are our primary driver, capital sales and the relationship between procedure growth rates and capital sales is highly sensitive, and likely variability in the timing of Japan system sails, given the timeline for obtaining other procedure reimbursement, beyond DPP, anticipated no sooner than 2016. Due to these factors affecting the capital side of our business, we will not be providing at this time. Our Q2 2014 pro forma gross margin was roughly 69%, having declined about 100 basis points compared to last year, largely reflecting lower gross profit margins under da Vinci Xi systems launched in Q2. As we move forward in 2014, we expect our gross profit margin to move differentially lower based upon the impact of new products, product mix and market conditions. Our actual gross profit will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely upon people mix and systems production volume. We believe deeply in our ability to fundamentally improve surgery and are continuing to pursue plans to increase the use of da Vinci enabled MIS around the globe. As stated previously, 2014 will be a year of increased investment for Intuitive Surgical. Even during this period of capital sales uncertainty, we remain focused on building our international capabilities, investing in new product development and pursuing growth in multiple areas of our procedure business. Last quarter we forecast full year operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2013 levels. We now expect to grow our operating expenses roughly 10% to 13% above the 2013 levels. We expect the 2014 non-cash stock compensation to be between $170 million and $180 million as compared to the $180 million to $190 million forecast on the previous call. We expect other income excluding the impact of the Q2 impairment charge to total between $13 million and $15 million. With regard to income tax, on our last call we forecast our income tax rate to be between 25% and 28% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. We are now refining this forecast to a range of between 26% and 28% of pretax income. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2014. Our share count for calculating diluted EPS in Q2 2014 was approximately 37.6 million shares. Going forward, based upon the full quarter impact of our Q2 buyback, we expect our Q3 shares count to be between 36.7 million and 36.9 million shares. We do not plan to repurchase any of our common stock in Q3. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Gary, given the – thank you for the comments by the way. Given the view on sort of the international investments that you’re making in the refinement of the expense structure this year, can you give us some sense of what else you have to do as you look into 2015 and what we might think about as a longer term kind of margin trajectory for the company?
Gary Guthart: As we’ve said in the opening remarks, at the product side I think we’ll see capital margins come down a little bit relative to where we were in prior years but instruments and return revenue being strong. As we look at the spend profile, I think the next couple of years will be a set of investments, some of them around products, some of them around international expansion as we’ve been telling you as we go through. And I think it will take a couple of years for those investments to play out.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Okay. And then as we look at kind of hernia opportunity that you’re highlighting here, can you size that for us a bit relative to maybe the colorectal – prostatectomy opportunity or general surgery, broadly. And how bigger contributor is that to the kind of the revision in the guidance and procedures that you gave today?
Gary Guthart: I think we’re too soon yet to break out all the segments in hernia. I guess I’d start by saying that hernia does have a fair number of segments, both in terms of where they are in the body and techniques that people use to approach them. We’re just working through now, what that looks like in terms of the value we bring to each one, so it’s a broad category, not a single procedure. We’re encouraged by it, I think that it’s growth rate has been real, it looks like there are real opportunities for us to bring value relative to alternative approaches, both clinical value and economic value, and that’s a good and powerful combination. So we’re not ready yet to break out the segment and size them for you, it looks to be a real opportunity, how big it ultimately will be, we’re going to have to work through the next couple of quarters before we publish that.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Okay. And I guess, one another quick question for us [ph]. If you think about kind of the distribution, who is buying Xi’s very Si’s this quarter, particularly in the U.S., what might that help you understand in terms of people’s willingness to buy in advance of the additional instruments that are being reviewed by FDA and would that track with your expectations where people are moving more quickly, just maybe a little bit more flavor on what was going on in the quarter. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Just in terms of basic response, we were pleased with the response of Xi. I think that surgeons in the markets that we had targeted for it, I think really appreciated it, understood the capabilities that were brought forward. Things like colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery, a lot of the kinds of features that we brought with things that they have been asking for or anticipating. I think I was positive surprised by some of the response of gynecologic oncology, some things that some features being brought forward that I think they’ll appreciate likewise in urology. So I think there was a broader positive reception than we had anticipated a surgical side. In terms of the splits of who is interested and who is buying from a commercial point of view. In the U.S. I’ll turn that to Marshall and just give a little color on, existing customers versus retails and so on.
Marshall Mohr: So within U.S. we saw [indiscernible] second systems – I think briefly I’ve just taken a little bit of longer that we’ll – resulting –
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question in queue will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
David Roman – Goldman Sachs: Thank you, and good evening. I wanted to maybe just start with a follow-up to Gary, your answer to the prior question regarding the next couple of years being a period of investment. As you kind of look forward in the evolution here of robotic surgery, globally why you want to visit to look like when you come at the other of that investment cycle. What would sort of be in your mind considered a successful trajectory for the company as we move beyond that investment period?
Gary Guthart: I think you’re asking around what is the financial profile or you’re asking around what is the ultimate like surgical vision?
David Roman – Goldman Sachs: Well, if you like to put it into growth rate terms, I – we generally take that but what operationally is actually going on in the business, and maybe anything you do to help frame it for us as this becomes standard of care across multiple category, do we see an inflection point in Europe, do we see multiple categories in Japan. Like what would you operationally want to see, come out of that.
Gary Guthart: Yes, so as we think about the opportunity looking forward I think there are a couple of big buckets. One of them in areas treating cancer and complex disease which are largely open surgical procedures, we see opportunity globally. In the U.S., we’re early in our experience in colorectal and thoracic; in Europe, we see opportunities in urology and gynecology for malignant conditions in colorectal and thoracic as well, likewise in Asia. So that sort of opportunities is one that we have been investing in, both on the product side as you know, things like Xi and stapling, and expanding and filling out the stapling line, as well as increasing our capabilities in terms of direct markets. And so, I think that opportunity is substantial, I think we’re still in the early innings of that – of exploring that opportunity and delivering those products and the consequences of those to those markets. So that’s one set that continues. A large part of our business is for gland [ph] surgery as well and you see things like the hernia opportunity we just discussed evolving pretty nicely. And as that happens, we will also look for products that optimize that opportunity, both clinically and economically. And I think those things are also translated cross borders. So we’re really working on both sets, we’re further ahead in adoption on the complex and cancer side, and so that’s where we’re starting in our U.S. markets for the most part. And that really informs the product pipeline in the go-to-market strategies that you’ve heard us talk about.
David Roman – Goldman Sachs: And then maybe just my follow-up on Japan, if you could go into perhaps a little bit more detail on the acquisition. I know in your prepared remarks you referenced a potentially closer to some of the medial societies, and my understanding in Japan is that the approval of indication does stem more for the medical society, that’s a little bit different from what we see in the rest of the world. Do you anticipate that this cultural relationship will provide you with access to helping – influence the adoption procedure rates, provide more clinical data. How can we see that play out in terms of gaining new applications in that country.
Gary Guthart: I think in general being closer to the user groups in the country helps us a lot in a bunch of different directions. One of them has made me sure we understand their needs and understand it in a very deep way. And in a broad setting so we are speaking to multi-specialties, that helps a lot. Number two is, as we say in Japan, the government interacts very closely with surgical societies to set guidance to understand data requirements and to help review issues and activities. And so having close relations with surgical societies, with keeping your leaders, and with our customers directly, those who already own our products. It help speed up the communication. It gets us more careful and deeper look into opportunities and issues to be resolved. And so we were pleased to do, it’s absolutely aligned with what we want to get done.
David Roman – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue that will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Robert Hopkins – Bank of America: Thank you, and good afternoon. So, the first question is on the procedure volume growth guidance that you provided. You grew 8% in the first half, you got easier comparisons in the back. And I just wanted to understand the 5% to 8%. Is there something specific that you guys are anticipating that would cause a lot bit of weakness despite the softer comps in the back half? And maybe specifically referring to hysterectomy there or is it just – it’s been kind of an interesting last year, and you want to remain conservative in your projections?
Gary Guthart: Looking at it there is not a specific thing that we think is looming and as we’ve said in the prepared remarks, I think there was some choppiness between Q1 and Q2 that had to do with quarter boundaries and some other things that may have been unique to Q1. And so if you look at the first half together rather than separating it on quarter boundaries, I think it gives a better picture of where we are. Going forward I think the determining factors will be continued strength in general surgery which we’ve been pleased with in the first half of the year. Offset by what happens next in gynecology in terms of stabilization, those are really underlying dynamics in the back half and that’s what Calvin has used to think through the back half range.
Calvin Darling: And there is other thing I’d point out Bob is, you talked about comparisons and when you get into the fourth quarter and seasonality of procedures complex benign procedures or simpler benign procedures, less complex, are more seasonal where you’d expect higher fourth quarter volumes. Now in the affordable care environment, you just don’t have a precedent for this with more people on high deductible plans and I think we’re learning as we go on that front and could some of these be deferred beyond a year, we’re just not sure. So it’s just another factor that we’ve considered.
Robert Hopkins – Bank of America: And then Gary, specifically on U.S. gain. I just wanted to kind of gauge your confidence that the trends we’re seeing in Q2 can remain at this type of level instead of getting worse. I noticed another article in JAM of today talking about morcellation. And I just wanted to kind of gauge your confidence specifically in U.S. gain and the stability of that kind of growth rate you’re experiencing today for the rest of the year?
Gary Guthart: Yes, I think that’s really interesting. On the clinical side and what da Vinci surgeons have been telling us, I think how the system works, what it can do for gynecology, it’s pretty stable and really won’t know. What’s hard to predict are any of the consequences of FDA guidance that – on tissue traction and things like that and part of that consequences that’s the range that Calvin has described to you. So I think as we look at that kind of the underlying dynamics of how our products are used, we feel like those are stable. I think as you look out what the environmental factors might do, that’s harder to predict and that accounts for the range [ph].
Robert Hopkins – Bank of America: Great. And just real quickly ask you why the expense guidance changed this quarter relative to what you gave at the beginning of the year?
Marshall Mohr: For half of the year we’ve obviously spent less than what we’ve have originally provided guidance for the year which was 12% to 15%, and so some of that had to deal with – I don’t think there is big difference but that had to do with the hiring patterns in – they will need to hire people quickly in Japan and places like that. So we’re little bit of to the favorable side but again, as I said earlier, we expect to ramp expenses as we do continue our international expansion in product development.
Gary Guthart: Yes, there is not a change there in our – what we believe is fundamentally important from an investment point of view. There are some things in the front half that are in a sense volume related cost that we didn’t have to incur and there are some things that are timing issues.
Robert Hopkins – Bank of America: Great, and congrats on the progress.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Lewis – Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon. Marshall, just a quick question on stock comp. It appears you want the street to value the company now excluding your stock compensation, just a couple of questions on that. I mean, I appreciate the non-cash charges but options are dilution for shareholders, so how does excluding that and still discipline how the company is going to issue equity awards [ph] and given it’s a form of compensation, why is it appropriate for us to evaluate Intuitive relative to peers who none of which back out stock comp?
Marshall Mohr: Sure, this isn’t a new thing, we always wanted to look at it without stock comp, we’ve previously provided you with a cash flow information that does include the impact of stock comp. I think in our particular stock – we’re pretty disciplined about how we issue equity. We maintain specific guidelines and I think are well within the industry parameters, 30% dilution on an annual basis. What [ph] is the valuation – I think Blackstone’s [ph] valuation has issues with it and one of those would be that it’s heavily reliant on volatility and other factors that go into the consultation. With our stock being a little bit more volatile, we unfavorably compare it to – with some of the peers like Johnson & Johnson, and so we think it’s better to look at us without it.
Gary Guthart: David, I think if you look broadly across larger cap, med-tech stock you’ll see that we range in stock based comp as a percent of revenue around 7% to 8% whereas most of the other companies range around 1%.
David Lewis – Morgan Stanley: But that’s just my point, it’s a form of compensation. So you need to be competitive against your peer group who are spending that compensation, you’re trying not to. That’s why I’m asking relative to your peer group call it sensible [ph]?
Gary Guthart: Short answer is we value equity, we understand completely dilution and we respect shareholders view of dilution. In terms of how our comp plans are absolutely built, we are building them so that we can be effectively for the talent that’s required to build this company and that’s relative to – sometimes med-tech but often our peer group is – in terms of talent is tech companies that share our location here in headquarters. And so, we’re careful about dilution, we don’t give it away without deep thought. It’s not in terms of what the expenses are, they are not in any way hidden, they are absolutely available, and when Marshall talks about pro forma he is really pointing out the economic engine of the company. So we understand and appreciate your remarks, we absolutely understand and respect to need to treat equity carefully.
David Lewis – Morgan Stanley: Let me just get a quick follow-up there, maybe to shift on the procedures because we’re probably going to agree or disagree on the prior topic but as you move over to main procedures, you gave us some nice color, Patrick did on DDH, just as you think relatively – can you give us any sense sequentially – it sounds like hernia did obviously much better but specifically as raised quality – whether quality [ph] progress sequentially low that was faster growth, slower growth or relatively the same quarter-on-quarter? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Generally the dynamics we described last quarter in quality really stated about the same in terms of – it continues to grow, we see a segment of the market that values it, both in terms of patients and in terms of the surgeons and institutions that are providing it. Directionally I think in terms of rates, it was more or less in line with where we were before, perhaps a slight slow in volume as growth.
Operator: And we’ll take your next question in queue that will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson – JPMorgan: Thanks. Given the strong placement number this quarter, I am just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how that flows through the revenues, particularly around the trade-in’s, I had a number of people asked why it didn’t show more revenue upside, given both strong procedures and the trade-in. So maybe just talk a little bit about that and how you think about trade-in to long two and the back half of the year? And then to follow-on, can you talk about the leasing option, you talked about the current percentage but what percentage of the potential systems are potentially open to operating leases?
Gary Guthart: With regards to the systems Tycho, the ASPs we report, the $1.5 million, they do reflect the contractual revenue related to the sales agreement. This quarter we did happen to have three systems that were shipped under operating lease arrangements where the system revenues will be recognized over future periods and there were also other sales involving financing terms where revenue will be deferred over future periods which again is offset by the upgrade portion within the system category. So I think it’s – with this additional complexity it’s not as simple as it was, just multiply the ASP, times of number of units and get the systems revenue but we are absolutely focused on finding the customer solutions and adding to the installed base.
Tycho Peterson – JPMorgan: And then on the clinical data site, can you talk – it seems like the clinical data might be little bit higher in Europe. Can you talk about whether you have the appropriate dataset today as you go out to further penetrate that market? And then is there any data on clinical efficacy or cost to support hernia at this point?
Gary Guthart: On the first question of what are the data requirements in Europe, in general I think they tend to ask for data in local countries and particularly around local economics and so on. And so, a lot of what the emphasis has been there has been making sure the datasets make sense in the country. We have good indications and good capability studies and lot of work from around the world so that can help guide us. But ultimately it requires engaging those markets directly and the surgical societies directly. So that’s kind of – what the European picture looks like. One hernia, it’s always in the experience, our hernia data will start to be collected and analyzed more broadly but as usual, in these kind of procedures the early upticks proceed the large studies.
Tycho Peterson – JPMorgan: Now lastly on SP, can you just give us a sense as to whether you finalized self standalone versus the caught on to Xi and any chance if the port size may come down from 25 millimeters initially?
Gary Guthart: Let’s see, on the first one we are designing the product such that it can link up an existing Xi or you can configure it as a standalone, so it will be able to sell either as a standalone or as an option of into an Xi, that’s our product plan. There is nothing fundamental in SP long-term that keeps us from changing port size. The initial design and the initial instrumentation are of particular size, the architecture is actually quite flexible.
Tycho Peterson – JPMorgan: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question in queue will come from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Tao Levy – Wedbush: Hey, good afternoon.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon.
Tao Levy – Wedbush: I wanted to ask about the U.S. procedure growth which you touched on and I’m trying to figure out you don’t work with the areas that kind of improved off in the quarter. I’m surprised to hear you answer to one of the prior questions that coli [ph] rates maybe were a little bit lower than in the Q1. So I’m just wondering where did the incremental improvement in the rates specifically come from.
Gary Guthart: Tao I think if you look through the comments we’ve made, the stabilization in GYN and the improvement in Q2 is the largest factor between Q1 and Q2. But we think you should increasingly look at – particularly with all this being going on and the volatility around the elective benign procedures, look at the first half of the year in aggregate, when you think about those procedures, given everything has been going on around the macro landscape.
Tao Levy – Wedbush: Okay. And also the deferred revenue for the systems in the quarter – I think Marshall talked about how you were going to make some changes to that, maybe I missed it but what are some of the changes that you expect on that and why weren’t sort of more systems that were deferred turned into revenue in the quarter?
Marshall Mohr: Effectively we deferred revenue associated with the number of systems we expected that would be traded back in, so there was an estimate involved there. So when I say that we would modify – I said we would modify that estimate as we go through time and in fact at the end of Q1 we’ll get there, certain customers that we understand will not trade-in, so we reversed that the accrual for that. As far as why didn’t more take us up on our own – remember right now the Xi isn’t fully featured and there are other products that will go with it, that we’re still working on getting ready to floor with [ph]. And we think that some customers may have hesitated for that reason but we’ve extended these offers until September 30, so they have till September 30 for Xi.
Tao Levy – Wedbush: Okay, that’s helpful. Thanks. And just lastly, any progress on ready update on the single-site, the articulated needle driver, if that’s still kind of year-end potential approval?
Gary Guthart: So – a couple of things, I think from a product design and usability point of view in terms of internal testing, that’s very, very good, so I’m quite encouraged there. We’re in the process with FDA, I think the process is following a routine kind of exchange and so it’s always hard to predict what the final endpoint will be there but I don’t see big barriers to completing that work.
Tao Levy – Wedbush: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Gary Guthart: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Richard Newitter with Leerink. Please go ahead.
Richard Newitter – Leerink: Hi, thanks for taking the questions guys. I just – I wanted to ask a question, thanks for the color on some of the clinical advancements that you guys saw, you’ve published or talked about this quarter. But I just was hoping to get a better idea of what and when we can expect perhaps a more definitive, either company sponsored or industry – not industry but surge and multi-center kind of definitive study analyzing things like colorectal experience using the robot versus the traditional laparoscopic surgery. I know there is a study ongoing called Roller [ph], is this something that should be viewed as a proxy and saying that could be more kind of catalytic for your adoption rates in colorectal? And if not, is there something else and is there anything that is Intuitive can do to help kind of create or generate this type of data?
Gary Guthart: Yes, a couple of things. I think it’s really important to start with – understanding the concept that both clinical efficacy and value, economic value, have to be evaluated procedure-by-procedure across both, the population of patients and a population of surgeons. And so what that means is that looking for the one definitive study on dementia’s [ph] is unlikely, you’re going to have to take it, it’s just not possible, you’re going to have to take it case-by-case. As you look at case-by-case, there was actually quite a bit that has been done already and quite a bit that is in process, both company sponsored and sponsored by others. We pay attention to it, it’s important, really the strong elements that must be present for us to tell anything. Take colorectal as an example. The majority of colorectal surgeries done are open, some are done lap, and now robotics is coming in. And so a good study, one that’s going to look at that looks at all of the patient population that’s being done open, the patient population that’s minimal lap, patient population that can be done robotically, as well as the variance in certain skill from those who are skilled laparoscopically and those who are not. So those are broad suites. Some of the studies going on approach that but a lot of them look at subsets. And so the kinds of things that we’re interested in making sure happen and support and ones that were broadly enough. I think it’s a huge mistake as Patrick said in his remarks, to go look at it. Some population that is lap, some population of patients that [ph] and ignore a majority of population which is open. So the short answer to your question is, those things were developed in time, they go procedure-by-procedure, we ask our folks who are investigating to look broadly and compare against the majority modalities, some of which are sponsored by us, some of which are sponsored by government sponsorship or other approaches and they will develop in time and we’ll share them with you as they come up.
Richard Newitter – Leerink: Great, thanks. And then maybe if I could just ask one other one – you called our hernia this quarter as obviously as a general surgery procedure category that’s – maybe gaining accelerated attention and adoption. Can you give a little color on the types of hernia surgeons that are performing these procedures, mostly around the experience level? And then – are you getting kind of the sought leaders in the space who are kind of taking us on and we should potentially see kind of more talk at the podium from high level thought leaders about this procedure or is this kind of more – kind of – I don’t know the right terminology but everyday surgeons, so to speak, in the hernia category.
Gary Guthart: Yes Rich, I think it’s early and we’re encouraged by what we’re seeing. You’re seeing about the mixed bag of procedures that are being done as well as the types of surgeons and who is adopting. So it’s early for us to try to pitching it into any given sub-segment yet but we plan to look closely at it and report on it moving forward. Thanks.
Richard Newitter – Leerink: Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Thank you very much. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. The following are two responses to our new Xi surgical system from experienced customers. From one of the most experienced robotic urologist, these are the best robot today, vision is nicer and clear, I can see structures very, very nicely. And from the patient side surgical assistant, docking process is easier and more efficient. Our second case was doc faster than our typical Si dockings, and we have done hundreds of those. We did not have a single external collision and there were almost no adjustments necessary. Usually on a bariatric procedure I’m adjusting the camera and instrument times frequently, but with the Xi it was not necessary. We believe we have a unique opportunity to improve surgery. The quotes above speak to the care and diligence of our design, operations, training and field teams in meeting our customers’ needs. This concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Thank you very much. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T’s executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q1 2014 Earnings Release Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to Intuitive Surgical's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and [Patrick Clingan] [ph], Director of Finance. Before we begin, I’d like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2014. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today’s press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results. Patrick will discuss procedures and clinical highlights, then I’ll provide our updated financial outlook for 2014. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. The first quarter was a difficult one in the United States. Certain elected da Vinci procedures in the U.S have been under significant pressure driven in part by changing surgical admissions, hospital financial uncertainty and payer incentives favoring watchful waiting and conservative treatment. System sales in the quarter were down largely as a result of slowing growth in our U.S procedures. Despite near-term challenges, we remain confident in the value our products bring to surgery and are pleased with the U.S launch and first sales of our newer system for da Vinci Xi Surgical System earlier this month. Turning to our procedure performance in the quarter, globally we experienced continued growth in general surgery and urology and a small declining gynecology. This resulted in 7% procedure growth in the first quarter over the first quarter of 2013. General surgery growth was led by increases in colorectal surgery and single-site cholecystectomy. Worldwide urology procedures experienced solid growth, particularly in prostatectomy, in Europe and Japan. Gynecology procedures fell slightly year-over-year, driven by a contraction of procedures in the United States. As a result, procedure growth for the United States in the quarter was below our expectations. Looking at procedures in the United States more deeply. General surgery led U.S procedure growth with strong uptake in colorectal surgery as well as encouraging early growth in several other general surgery procedures. Single-site cholecystectomy growth was solid in the quarter. The growth rate slowed relative to prior quarters in part due to exaggerated seasonality this quarter as well increasing economic pressures on hospitals. As announced in our pre-release, U.S gynecology declined in the low single-digits year-over-year in the quarter, pressured by several factors including increased Q1 seasonality, payer disincentives for benign surgery and growing penetration in minimally invasive surgery for hysterectomy. Going forward, we expect U.S gynecology to pressure overall procedure growth rates through 2014. Patrick will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. Turning to markets outside of the United States, procedure growth in Asia was strong off of a small base with urology, general surgery, and gynecology segments contributing. We continue to expect lumpiness in capital sales in Asia due to limited reimbursement in Japan as well as anticipation of Xi approvals in the coming quarters. In Europe, procedure growth was solid with urology, gynecology, and general surgery contributing to growth. We have filed for the CE Mark for our Xi system and system sales for the next quarter or two may be lumpy as customers evaluate the new system. Taken together, total system sales worldwide in the quarter were 87 down from 164 in Q1, 2013. We launched our da Vinci Xi System in April at the SAGES Conference. The Xi System is optimized for multi-quadrant, multi-port procedures with smaller arms having greater reach and overhead architecture that allows multiple setup locations without repositioning the base of the system, a smaller wider endoscope with improved imaging capability and a host of other features that streamline setup and use. Early customer feedback has been enthusiastic and we look forward to its continued adoption in surgery. The Xi System has not a direct replacement for our Si System and we continue to sell, support and develop instruments for the Si. We’ve submitted 510(k) clearance applications for our advanced instruments for Xi, including the Xi Vessel Sealer and the Xi Stapler. We plan to submit our Firefly 510(k) for Xi this month. da Vinci Xi currently does not have the available single-site instruments and the five millimeter instruments and it is not currently indicated for [trans level] [ph] procedures. As a result, we expect Xi adoption to proceed at a measured pace through 2014, as new instruments for Xi come to market and customers evaluate the differences between Si and Xi. This week we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the da Vinci Sp Surgical System, which is designed to expand our single-port product offerings. The initial clearance is specific to urologic surgical procedures that are appropriate for a single-port approach. da Vinci Sp is built around a dedicated single-port patient side cart that delivers an articulating 3D HD camera and three fully articulating instruments through a single 25 millimeter cannula. The EndoWrist Sp instruments have additional wrist joints inside the body compared to our current single-site instruments. This is a sophisticated technology that we believe has long-term potential in several areas of surgery. We do not intend to commercialize da Vinci Sp until the current technology is engineered to be fully compatible with our newly released da Vinci Xi, currently projected for the second half of 2015. This will require product refinements, supply chain optimization and additional regulatory clearances. Over the long-term we believe a single-port cart will complement not replace multi port and single-site technologies. Turning to instruments, we’ve expanded launches of both our da Vinci Stapler and da Vinci single-site for hysterectomy. da Vinci Stapler adoptions has been solid with strong reorder rates from early customers and increased utilization in colorectal surgery, our target market. We're working on enhancements to da Vinci stapling by developing a [wide re-] [ph] load as well as pursuing indications in thoracic surgery. Our early launch of the single-site hysterectomy is expanding at a measured pace with solid procedure growth from the small base and robust customer interest. Development of our wristed single-site needle driver for Si is progressing and we plan to submit our 510(k) for the wristed needle driver later this month. We’ve been in regular contact with FDA while we work through -- while we work to resolve issues identified in prior audits and our Q4 warning letter. The FDA conducted a follow-up inspection of the Company in this first quarter in which they reviewed actions and process that address prior findings as well as exploring other areas. While we have made significant progress in addressing their concerns, they have noted additional areas for improvement that will be published on form 43, which we will post on our Web site later this week. We continue to strengthen our operations capabilities and compliance programs by further developing our team, engaging seasoned leadership and improving our processes. Our U.S business is undergoing change, it is worth stepping back in considering the long-term value of da Vinci in surgery. In neurology we see significant opportunity globally for prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy procedures for which clinical and economic evidence supporting da Vinci use is well developed. Here we’re focused on building our capability in Europe and Asia to support urologic growth. In gynecology, the economic value of da Vinci in hysterectomy for a broad population of patients has been demonstrated in papers like the ones Patrick will describe shortly. We are supporting further clinical and economic evidence development for hysterectomy and other gynecologic procedures globally. Also, we’re in the early days of our single-site launch for hysterectomy. We believe additional instrumentation like our wristed single-site needle driver will make a significant difference for single-site surgeons. General surgery opportunity exists in several procedures globally, including colon and rectal resections, bariatric procedures, and other procedures within the abdomen. In general surgery we are investing in products that optimize procedures, including stapler in vessel sealing, Firefly and our da Vinci Xi as well as supporting evidence development and research. Thoracic surgery also holds long-term potential for ISI, but we’re developing products including Stapling and da Vinci Xi to address those thoracic procedures typically done through an open incision.
.: As of to date we estimate that these opportunities represent millions of procedures annually for the countries in which we already operate. In future years we anticipate expanding our presence more deeply into Asia, India, and Latin America, further expanding the potential of da Vinci to positively impact surgery. I’ll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our first quarter 2014 revenue and procedures were consistent with our press release issued on April 8th. First quarter revenues were $465 million, down 24%, compared with $611 million for the first quarter 2013, down 19% from last quarter. Procedures for the first quarter grew approximately 7%, compared with the first quarter of 2013, and were down approximately 5% compared with last quarter. First quarter 2014 revenue is net of approximately $26 million of deferred -- of revenue deferred in association with offers made to first quarter U.S customers, to trade-in their recently purchased da Vinci Si Surgical Systems for our recently announced da Vinci Xi Surgical System. The trade-in program also provides our customers the opportunity to exchange certain recently purchased da Vinci Si instruments and accessories for da Vinci Xi instruments and accessories. The deferrals reduced first quarter 2014 system revenue by approximately $24 million in instrument and accessory revenue by approximately $2 million. The $26 million in deferral equates to $0.29 per share and is expected to be recognized within 2014. Procedure highlights will be covered by Patrick. Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue was down 2%, compared with the first quarter of 2013 and was down 5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease relative to the prior periods reflects lower instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with fewer system sales, the 2 million deferral associated with the trade-in program, the impact of changes in procedures, offset by increased sales of newer products. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,920 per procedure compared with $2,110 for the first quarter of 2013 and $1,930 last quarter. The decrease from the prior year reflects fewer stocking orders associated with fewer system sales, partially offset by new product sales. The increase from the prior quarter primarily reflects new product sales and the timing of customer orders. Systems revenue of $106 million decreased 59% compared with the first quarter of 2013 and decreased 48% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline in systems revenue reflects fewer system sales. In the U.S., we sold 45 systems in the first quarter compared with 115 systems in the first quarter of 2013 and 72 systems in the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline in U.S. system sales reflects the impact of lower procedure growth, spending uncertainties associated with the Affordable Care Act, customer anticipation of a new system being released and relative to the fourth quarter seasonality. We sold 13 Si-es compared with 21 last quarter and five in the first quarter of 2013 at prices just below a $1 million depending on their configuration, reflecting continued demand for lower cost systems for use in lower reimbursed procedures. Globally, our ASP of $1,476,000 increased relative to the fourth quarter system ASP of $1,455,000. The increase reflects a favorable geographic and product mix. In the first quarter, we sold 23 dual console systems compared with 38 systems in the fourth quarter. Outside the U.S., we sold 42 systems in the first quarter, including 14 in Europe and 19 in Japan, compared with 49 systems in to international markets in the first quarter of 2013, which included 16 in Europe and 25 in Japan and 66 systems into international markets in the fourth quarter of 2013 which included 28 into Europe and 21 into Japan. First quarter system sales also included three into each of France and Spain. Note, the first quarter is typically seasonally slower in most overseas markets except Japan. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, gross margin in the first 2014 was 67.9% compared with 71% for the first quarter of 2013 and 69.1% for the fourth quarter of 2013. Our lower margin percentage reflects a higher mix of new product sales and costs spread over lower production levels. Margins on newly launch products were typically be lower than our mature products reflecting vendor pricing on low volumes, temporary tooling costs and other start-up costs. However, over time as volumes increase and we refine the manufacturing process and the product, we’d expect to see improvement in the margins of these newer products, although they may not ultimately reach the level of our matured products. Our margins on the Xi system will be lower than the margins for our Si products. As described in our pre-earnings release dated April 08, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $67 million equal to a $1.25 per share to reflect the estimated costs of settling a number of product liability legal claims against the Company. These claims relate to alleged complications from surgeries performed with certain versions of monopolar cautery scissor, or MCS instruments that included an MCS tip cover accessory that was the subject of a market withdrawal in 2012, and surgeries that were performed with MCS instruments that were subject of a recall in 2013. The Company’s estimate of the anticipated costs of settling these claims is based on negotiations with attorneys for patients who have participated in the mediation process that the Company established in conjunction with the polling agreement. To date approximately 3,000 claims have been reviewed as part of the mediation process. Many of these claims gave rise to MDRs reported in the FDA’s MAUDE database. First quarter 2014 operating expenses of $192 million excluding $67 million charge were in line with our planned spending and reflect investments in overseas markets and new products. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26.8% compared with 26.1% for the first quarter of 2013 and 22.5% last quarter. The first quarter of 2013 tax rate benefited from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D credit for 2012 as well as the federal R&D credit for 2013. The federal R&D credit has not been renewed for 2014 and therefore is not reflected in the first quarter tax rate. Our net income was $44 million or $1.13 per share, compared with $189 million or $4.56 per share for the first quarter of 2013 and $166 million or $4.28 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. An important measure of our performance is cash flow from operations. We define cash flow from operations as net income, excluding tax, non-cash – after-tax, non-cash compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We will refer to this as non-GAAP net income. For the first quarter 2014, excluding the legal accrual of $67 million and the deferral of $26 million, we generated $135 million in non-GAAP net income or $3.46 per share, compared with $205 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter 2013. We ended the year with cash and investments of $3 billion, up from $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by $166 million in net cash provided by operating activities. Keep in mind that the $67 million charge to income has not affected cash flow to date. We’ve not repurchased shares in the first quarter. As of March 31st, we still have 1 billion of share buybacks authorized. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Patrick to go over procedure and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan: Thanks, Marshall. Q1 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 7%, with U.S. procedures growing 3% and international procedures growing 24%.On a macro basis, payer headwinds combined with higher patient payments have impacted the number of benign hysterectomies in the U.S and in turn the number of da Vinci hysterectomies performed, with both declining during the first quarter. This minimally invasive surgery is currently a high proportion of benign hysterectomies and there is wide dispersion of the remaining open procedures among hospitals and surgeons. We expect da Vinci hysterectomy to continue to decline roughly in line with declines in the market through 2014. Other benign GYN procedures including sacrocolpopexies, endometriosis resections, and myomectomies also experienced year-over-year declines in the first quarter. We are in our early launch phase of single-site kit for hysterectomies. The growth rate in the quarter was high off of a very small base. We plan to bring our single-site Wristed Needle Driver to the market in order to further enable benign hysterectomy procedure adoption, but it is too early to predict whether this will drive overall growth in dVH. Before moving on, let me take a moment to discuss the recent FDA announcement discouraging the use of power morcellators and the surgical removal of assumed benign fibroids. Intuitive does not manufacture or sell power morcellation products. Power morcellators do not attach to da Vinci Systems and minimally invasive da Vinci surgeries are routinely performed without the use of power morcellators in both benign and malignant GYN surgeries. Said another way, for many patients surgeons do not have to choose between minimally invasive surgery and morcellation. Other alternatives for tissue extraction exist. In the near-term this announcement may create uncertainty for surgeons and patients when choosing among minimally invasive surgical methods for removing fibroids. Moving forward, we look to surgical societies as they set guidance for removal of assumed benign fibroids. For da Vinci cholecystectomy, moderating growth appears to be attributable to both seasonality and physicians increasingly offering single-site to those patients that are cosmetically sensitive and not morbidly obese. Looking more deeply, adoption is taking place primarily among commercially insured patients seeking treatment from physicians at private hospitals with the ability to offer single-site benefits to patient, the hospital and the surgeon. If adoption remains limited to this segment, we’d likely address a more narrow patient population than we previously expected. We continue to believe that patients desire an improved cosmetic outcome compared to multi-port MIS. We have optimized the economics of our offering for our systems and instruments and we believe material operating costs are currently at a small premium to multi-port laparoscopic material operating expenses. Beyond cholecystectomy, broader growth in U.S general surgery is encouraging as we continue to see adoption across many sub specialties. In particular, colon and rectal resections are a source of strength along with a variety of other surgeries for malignant and benign conditions. Well many of these procedures are too early to include in our addressable market opportunity, we are encouraged by the level of surgeon interest in these procedures as we continue to expand the breadth of our instrumentation for general surgeons. Investments in the colorectal market including products and market development are showing results. International procedure growth of 24% remain strong. Growth was led by urology, with meaningful contributions from GYN and general surgery. DDP uptake in Europe and Japan continues to be robust sustaining the momentum we gained in the back half of 2013. Highlighting the growing interest in da Vinci surgery education, 2013 European Association of Urology’s Robotics section highlighted a da Vinci fellowship training program with 10 leading academic institutions across six countries. The Robotics section expanded the fellowship pilot in 2014 to 17 institutions as more country level societies support the program. During the quarter, we continue to see growth in peer reviewed publications, highlighting da Vinci used in a number of journals. I’ll take a moment to highlight just a few. Total cost to treat a population of patients is of high importance as providers are increasingly focused on published in health management. Two GYN studies published in this month edition of Obstetrics & Gynecology show an interesting juxtaposition of how two cost effectiveness studies can look at the same subject and develop contrasting conclusions, with one using a population health perspective, while the other evaluate the subset of the population. The first study from Dr. Leitao and team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering took a population health perspective on the impact robotic surgery could have to the overall cost of malignant hysterectomies in the U.S. Looking at the adoption of robotic surgery within MSK for malignant hysterectomies from 2009 to 2010, the study showed laparoscopic procedures were less expensive than robotic procedures and then robotic procedures were less expensive than open surgery. By extrapolating the MSK experience to a national experience, including the reduction in the rate of higher cost open surgery. The study concluded that the adoption of robotic surgery lowered the cost of malignant hysterectomies when evaluated for population health. In contrast to these findings, Wright et al of Colombia wrote a follow-up to their 2013 publication. Using a similar methodology to the 2013 paper, this study also found that robotic surgery was more expensive than laparoscopic surgery, expanded to include both malignant and benign procedures. The study excluded the impact robotic surgery has brought to the broader population of patients who are historically treated through open surgery and the cost savings associated with the overall reduction in surgical morbidity. The contrasting outcomes of these papers illustrates the impact that population selection has in drawing an economic conclusion. As providers look to manage population health more directly under the Affordable Care Act, Dr. Leitao study is more broadly applicable to a total population. We continue to work with customers to improve the understanding of the economic value da Vinci brings. Next, the incidence rate and associated surgical procedures for early stage lung cancer are likely to increase, following the US PSTF recommendation to provide CT scanning to smokers at a high risk of developing cancer. Two recent studies have compared multi-center results of da Vinci lobectomies to over 10,000 lobectomies from the STS database gathered from 2010 to 2012. The first study published in Innovations from Dr. Farivar and colleagues of Swedish Medical Center in Seattle compare open lobectomy to video assisted thoracic surgery or VATS and robotic lobectomies, and found that the use of robotic technology reduced the operative time, chest tube duration, post-operative blood transfusion and length of stay compared to both open and VAT lobectomies. More importantly, the use of robotic technology also showed a reduction in 30-day mortality compared to both open and VAT. The second study from Dr. Adams and team of Owensboro Medical Health System in Kentucky, published in the Annals of thoracic surgery compared to the initial 20 completely portable robotic lobectomies or CPRL from six community surgeons to the STS database. While reflecting the initial robotic case series from each of these surgeons, the authors concluded “CPRL was superior in several measures compared with open.” as well as “outcomes were equivalent between CPRL and VATs trending in favor of robotics.” I will conclude with two international publications on da Vinci use for rectal resections. Two papers focusing on robotic versus open or laparoscopic total mesorectal excision or TME. The first paper published in the European Journal of Surgical Oncology is from a group of Italian and Brazilian surgeons based at leading academic institutions. The study included 174 patients and results showed that at 5 years post-operation robotic TME has a lower rate of local cancer recurrence compared to open TME. The study also highlighted an increase in lymph nodes harvested reduced blood loss and lower length of stay at the cost of a longer OR time. The second paper from China published in the Journal of Surgical Research by [ph] [Dr. Xiong] and colleagues from the Chongqing Medical University performed a meta-analysis on the robotic TME compared to laparoscopic TME. The study identified over 1,200 patients and showed that robotic TME was associated with a lower conversion rate from minimally invasive surgery to open surgery, a lower positive margin rate and a lower rate of erectile dysfunction compared to laparoscopic TME. This concludes my remarks and I thank you for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2014. Starting with procedures, on our last call we estimated full-year 2014 procedure growth of 9% to 12% above the approximately 523,000 procedures performed in 2013. Now based upon factors described earlier on the call impacting U.S. for GYN, gynecology and other elective procedures, we’re adjusting our 2014 procedure growth estimate to a range of between 2% and 8%. This is a wider range than we have previously communicated giving consideration to increased volatility in elective procedures and the recent FDA statement discouraging the use of power morcellation techniques and the potential impact this may have on our procedure business. Moving to revenues, as it has been discussed earlier several factors are pressuring our business making it difficult in the near term for us to predict system sales volumes and as a consequence total revenue, specifically the breath and evolving nature of our procedure growth. As a reminder procedures are a primary driver of capital sales and the relationship between procedure growth rates and capital sales is highly sensitive. Our recent introduction of the da Vinci Xi System an upcoming period of transition in advance of it's release in international markets and ahead of the availability of Xi versions of certain advanced instruments, continued economic pressure and uncertainty at hospitals associated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, evolving utilization patterns and point of care dynamics and likely variability in the timing of Japan system sales given the timeline for obtaining additional procedure reimbursement and beyond dVP anticipated no sooner than 2016. Due to these factors affecting the capital side of our business, we will not be providing a revenue forecast at this time. As mentioned on last quarters call, we expect to sell fewer systems in 2014 than the 546 systems sold in 2013. Our Q1, 2014 gross profit percentage was roughly 68%. As we moved forward in 2014 we expect our gross profit percentage will shift directionally lower given that our newly launched da Vinci Xi System has lower gross profit margins at launch than the mature Si-e platform. While we will look to cost reduce the products and improve margins over time the da Vinci Xi will negatively impact gross margins in 2014. We also anticipate a growing proportion of sales of newer lower margin instrument products throughout the year including Stapler and Vessel Sealer. Our actual gross profit margin will vary depending largely on product mix and systems production volume. We believe deeply in our ability to fundamentally improve surgery and are continuing to pursue plans to increase the use of da Vinci enabled MIS around the globe. As stated previously, 2014 will be a year of increased investment for Intuitive Surgical. Even during this period of capital sales uncertainty we will be building our international capabilities investing in new product developments and pursuing growth in multiple areas of our procedure business. Now excluding the impact of this quarters $67 million charge for estimated legal settlements, we continue to expect to grow our operating expenses roughly 12% to 15% above 2013 levels. We expect our 2014 non-cash stock compensation expense to be towards the lower end of the $180 million to $190 million range communicated on last quarters call compared to $169 million in 2013. We continue to expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $15 million and $20 million in 2014 also towards the lower end of the range. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2014 income tax rate to be between 25% and 28% of pre-tax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2014. Our share count for calculating diluted EPS in Q1, 2014 was approximately 39.1 million shares. Our actual Q2 and fiscal year 2014 share count will depend on several factors including the magnitude and timing of any additional share buybacks. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we have our first question from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please ask your question.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Good afternoon guys.
Gary Guthart: Hi, Ben.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Gary, talk to us a little bit more about the 12% to 15% increase in OpEx with the revenue projection you just gave. Obviously you run the business on a multi-year basis and we all believe or at least we believe there’s a long-term opportunity. But what are you seeing in ’15 and the needs of the company today that, that’s going to justify that level of spending with this revenue forecast?
Gary Guthart: I think as we have said in the past the places we’re investing I think really all points to our future growth and they are international markets both in Europe, Japan, other places in Asia over time as well as bringing to market products that we think helps surgeons and therefore expand our opportunity both deepening it in markets that were already existing and a good potential to open new markets. I think that scaling back quickly as a result of near term pressure is not a long-term best interest of the Company.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay, no that’s fair. So, should we think about a more kind of, if you will, permanent lower domestic growth rate given some of the pressures or maybe a multi-year lower domestic growth rate because it does sound like the continued effort to shift towards international is where the bulk of the growth would be coming from?
Gary Guthart: I think it's from my point of view too soon to make that comment. I look out and say it's clear that there are some changing dynamics within the U.S. marketplace particularly around some of the procedures that are elective. Some of those things are broader than in Intuitive when you look at the changes to surgical admissions that are changing and some of the payer behaviors around incentives or just incentives around surgery, we’ll have to see how those things wash out in time. Some of them have to do with internal focus of the company as we look at opportunities and have adjusted ourselves towards focus that will pay off in time but those things take a little time to wash through. And so, I think that’s a good question to ask again and then again in future quarters and I would not call it right now.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay, last question for me. Talking about if you will instrument pocket share in the evolving area of general surgery, if we go out to all or maybe even 24 months, what percentage of the instruments that are not da Vinci today in a particular case for you all in the training center, do you think we’ll still not be da Vinci at that point, can we get to a 100% pocket share or is it going to be 50% for some -- whatever the number is for some protracted period of time? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yes, so as you think about what kinds of things makes sense for a customer on the da Vinci platform where we can really bring value, probably not a 100% but certainly higher than we are today and I don’t think we have called out here’s the endpoint, but a good example Vessel Sealer has been really well received by our customer, the adoption has gone deeper in different places than we had anticipated when we started and as we look at stapling in it's early adoption into Colorectal that’s been pretty positive for us, customer feedback comment has been strong. And as we expand the stapling offering to bring them articulation and stability and some of the things that we can bring, I think that’s an opportunity for the company as we go forward. So, I don’t think we can peg an exact number for you, but I think it will move up certainly in the kind of the multi port -- multi-quadrant procedures that we think we can make a big difference in in the near term. Go ahead Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Yes, and just a few thoughts on just the overall metric of instrument accessory revenue per procedure. As it was mentioned, we saw the positive contribution of the Stapler and the Vessel Sealer here in the first quarter which really effectively offset the negative impact primarily from lower stocking orders with the lower system sales in the quarter. So the overall metric was fairly in line the first quarter of this year with fourth quarter of last year. And so, as you kind of look forward, this higher proportion -- you’re going to have a higher proportion of Single-Site and less complex benign procedures in the overall mix and you have the positive impacts of Vessel Sealer and Firefly. So as you look out into 2014 you’ve got factors moving in either direction and it's really difficult to gauge the net direction of the metric moving forward in this year.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Thanks. I just want to understand the guidance revision on procedures specifically around the issue of morcellation which as you called out does not, you do not sell power morcellation products, but in the revised guidance you did call that out as a factor. So, can you maybe just talk about how you see that impacting the market and do you need to kind of step up marketing efforts around that to clarify the situation?
Gary Guthart: In the near term I think that the surgical societies are going to look and evaluate and they are what the implications are for minimally invasive surgery as a whole. As we mentioned we -- power morcellation is not a part of many, many of the gynecologic procedures we do. I think there will be some reassessment by the surgical societies and by surgeons themselves as they kind of look at tissue extraction techniques and where they want to take guidance from there. So, for us it's pretty hard to forecast. I think at this point we’re just going to have to wait and see. da Vinci offers dexterity and the opportunity for alternative techniques to tissue extraction and so over time we’ll see where surgeons want to go with that. And Patrick, I don’t know if you want to add.
Patrick Clingan: I think Tycho that the issue here really is about the unknown oncologic status of these fibroids. If you step back and you think da Vinci is commonly used in procedures where cancer has been diagnosed. So while it's hard for us to get precise on it, we think -- until some of the treatment approaches are more settled there might be some uncertainty in the market place here over the short run.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Okay. And then since this is the first call post the launch of the Xi, can you maybe just talk about some of the early momentum understanding it's not necessarily an upgrade to the Si, but have you seen any interest in existing Si customers upgrading and then can you help us kind of quantify the opportunity around multi-quadrant procedures and maybe areas like microsurgery, which seem like they could be applicable as well?
Gary Guthart: Marshall, I'll let you describe a little bit of the early pipeline as qualitatively as you see it.
Marshall Mohr: Sure. So, I am not going to talk about inter-quarter activity, but intra-quarter activity but on the other hand there was a -- as you know there was a hospital in Texas that put out a press release on their first procedure and the excitement around it and the interaction that we have had with customers is positive. I’m not going to predict how it's going to roll out. As Gary said in his part, there are certain instruments that da Vinci surgeons that are not yet available for it, so it will probably be a roll out over time versus [inaudible] upfront. 
Gary Guthart: When we think about multi-quadrant procedures and work that people are excited about, a lot of the features that have gone into the Xi are ones that surgeons have been interested in and asked us about and we’ve been in development with them for some time. So the idea of being able to in essence change setups without having to move the base around the longer instruments help in larger patient populations in general surgery, the narrow instruments get you into tighter spaces, and so as we look at general surgery, general surgery is indeed that, a lot of different procedures and so we’re excited about the flexibility that the setup of the platform brings as well as things like forward hopping the idea that the camera can move between different cannula to be able to get different views of the anatomy. So, I think that’s been strong for us. Micro-surgery is not something we’ve talked about. I am not quite sure where that came from. It's not an indication on the Xi and so, perhaps another time we could talk about that in more detail.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Last one, just quickly on the new Sp system announced today, I have had a few people asking about the 25 millimeter port size. Does that get you around the wrist of hernia and maybe just talk to the discussions with FDA, you’ve obviously gone after some of your competitors around port-site hernia.
Gary Guthart: The 25 is about the same size as the port that’s going on, that used a little bit different type of construction that’s being used in Single-Site. I am not personally an expert in the herniation issues although understanding and listening to surgeons, I understand that how you make the cut down, how you make the incision and how you close it, closer technique has a large impact in what those things look like. Conversations with regard to FDA have really centered around the technical performance aspects of the device and its application to urology in terms of Sp itself, so really no additional color to provide you on that front.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please ask your question.
Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thanks very much. Can you hear me okay?
Gary Guthart: Yes.
Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. So I just wanted to clarify some things on the procedure volume guidance. I just want to make sure I heard you right to start out, so your guidance is for 2014 now for procedure volume growth is 2% to 8% that’s a global number, correct?
Gary Guthart: That’s correct.
Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: So you started the year at 7%, and so obviously what you’re contemplating here is things potentially getting worse from here. And so I’d really like to just understand to the degree you’re willing to talk about it. What are you contemplating getting worse from here, is this GYN getting a little bit worse or it's just GYN and chole getting a little bit worse. And then just broadly speaking, what turns this around in your view?
Gary Guthart: Yes, I think it's -- when you look at and the things we’re calling out are the increasing pressure that we’re seeing in the U.S. gynecology procedures, factors that we discussed on the call including the payer disincentives for benign surgery effects are of the Affordable Care Act and impacts on procedure potentially involving the power morcellation which is a rather recent event. We’ve seen more volatility in these elective procedures and economic sensitivity as well. So, that’s on the gynecology side, and then specific to Cholecystectomy as Patrick talked about what appears to be a tightening really of the types of patients that maybe that target robotic candidates. And so these are early days on both these categories, but I think the range of the guidance is broader and lower in recognition of these factors.
Patrick Clingan: Yes, just to add a little light. I think the big issue here is that you see some shifting winds in the U.S. benign surgery market place broader than intuitive and some that are specific to us. So, I think that uncertainty is pretty high especially around total hysterectomies -- in total the whole set not just us over time. And I think as hospitals start adjusting to some of the implications of Affordable Care Act and some of the swings an seasonality that we’re seeing the exaggerated swings. We’ll have to see how that plays out in the year and that’s what accounts for this broad range.
Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: And so, I really had a follow-up to that, and Gary this is a question for you. It's a question on buyback but it's really a question about trying to understand your intended message regarding confidence in your long-term opportunities versus the near term uncertainties. So as you noted there’s no buyback this quarter and obviously there’s a lot of uncertainty, but you’re sitting on $3 billion in cash, you have a $1 billion buyback authorized. And my question is; why wouldn’t now be a time for you guys to be more aggressive about the buyback if you’re encouraged about the long-term, and so again, I am really just trying to gauge here long-term opportunities versus near term uncertainty.
Gary Guthart: Right. I think that directionally we feel like buybacks are a good idea when we feel like there is a good opportunity for the company to be in the market and that’s something we speak about routinely with the board here and so we’ll see. I think with the fair amount of volatility that’s been evidenced in the U.S. market and it's likely to persist for some time given all the moving parts in the U.S. market when opportunities arise then I think the board will sit down and evaluate.
Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: And then just lastly really quickly on the Sp system, could you just talk a little bit more about that. What does that look like long-term, really who is the customer for Sp, is that potentially a less expensive system that could be targeted to outpatient. I just want to understand who the real customer is for Sp as you see it, thinking long-term when you have multiple approvals and just trying to understand where this is going?
Gary Guthart: Right. So, the first thing is that, we have not announced pricing. Likely the operating cost for the Sp system will slide in above Single-Site and add a slight premium to a da Vinci set. It's not finalized, so it is not an operating cost lower cost than Single-Site which is actually quite good already. Single-Site instrumentation from a material cost point of view are within about $100 of multi-port laparoscopic cost. So the material cost comparisons are quite good on Single-Site. Already this has additional capability and we’ll come into from an operating point of view at a small premium to that price point. In terms of why we think it's interesting, the first indication to be entirely clear is urology. We think there is some interesting things that can be done particularly in things like kidney cancer where you have the removal of the specimen. I think these are the type of procedures where co-articulation and forearms make sense in a single-port context. As we think about other places in the future that might have interesting indications, we think about places where you’re going to be in confined spaces, head and neck is one of them, transanal procedures are another place that people have real interest in. And one of the reasons that we're talking about this a little bit early relative to launch is to give us room to discuss it with surgeons to develop it in terms of clinically clinical laboratory work over time, so we get a real chance to interact with customers about where this kind of architecture can take us. I think early interest is quite high in terms of enthusiasm. I think there is real work to be done in terms of refining some of the elements that are present in terms of both of the supply chain and the indications and we look forward to doing that over time. Long-term I think there are some unique capabilities here technologically that may lead us to some interesting questions.
Robert Hopkins - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: Thank you and good evening. I wanted to ask one strategic question and then one just specific question about the numbers and maybe starting with the strategic side. Gary, I listened to your commentary in that prepared remarks where you brought up international, I think you didn’t specially call emerging markets where you brought up Asia, India, Latin America. It sounds like there’s sort of a shift a little bit in the strategy here as the U.S. markets mature and that thus the focus of the company is moving to being more of a global medical device company with a little bit more of a broader focus and lesser sort of a pure play technology company and if sort of you look at the market valuation showed us different types of businesses. I am just wondering how you sort of think about the evolution of the business as you start to look, it sounds like more sort of singles and doubles versus homerun opportunities coming from expansion of therapy versus kind of new product launches.
Gary Guthart: Yes, I understand the question. I don’t think certainly in the next few years I don’t see that it's either or I think that we’ve made real investments and we’ll continue to invest in those technologies we think can make a real difference in surgery and I expect that to continue. And the indications around thinking globally are not strongly this year or next year, I know you’re following, you know we’ve been investing in Europe and Japan. Longer term as you look multiple years out, I think there are real opportunities in other parts of Asia in Latin America and I think it will be important for the company to be there. It's not intended to signal a hard right-turn away from innovation. Innovation is in our DNA, you see it routinely in the products that we develop and bring to market and I expect that to continue.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: And then maybe just a second question on, maybe this does relate a little bit to the slowing in choles, but one of the things that you’ve been talking about and this came up more in the fourth quarter call was on the R&D spending to collect more clinical data to support the adoption of therapies where you have stronger competition, I am presuming that’s sort of Ethicon and Covidien, but maybe you could sort of talk about the type of data you’re going to be collecting on choles in some of those procedures where you need to be more competitive and then ultimately when that could drive a resumption in growth in those categories -- a reacceleration of growth?
Gary Guthart: As you look out I think the types of data are pretty clear and we’ve seen them collected. I think first you collect simple outcome data and that evolves in time from single institution studies, so multi institution studies and so on. And then with that I think economics that follow. So really it's a combination of how are your products used, followed by what kind of outcomes are being attained followed by what are the economic consequences of those outcomes and that’s really what we invest in. And where you have all three you see strong benefit, where the out products are less differentiated, where the outcomes are differentiated and the economics follow, that has been a strong predictor of growth and so, that’s a routine part of what we do both in the U.S. and OUS each health system calculates some of these things a little bit differently, disease states vary a little bit country-to-country and so it's not just the U.S. centric activity.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and maybe just a quick last one, I know Bob asked the question about buybacks and I understand the comments around volatility in the market, but maybe you just broadly help us think about the capital allocation if there are other priorities you might look at given some of the gyrations in the top line here and you haven't spoken about M&A sort of that in the past as a potential maybe how you’re thinking about broader use of cash in the context of everything that’s going on here?
Gary Guthart: The basic elements as you’ve seen has been organic growth -- funding organic growth and development where we need to. We have invested OUS and sometimes those investments are organic and sometimes there are acquisitions of things that are important. I expect that to continue. We routinely look for technologies that will enhance our product lines and acquire them on an ongoing basis. Typically those have not been huge acquisitions, but in the future if there’s an opportunity and a need then those can grow. And so those are really the basic elements in the mix. They change a little bit in terms of how they’re mixed together over time, but the three elements are all there.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you very much.
Gary Guthart: Next caller please. Operator? All right, we appear to have lost our operator. If you’re still on, I’ll go ahead and close. While we discuss financial metrics on these call our organization remains focused on developing, delivering products that allow surgeons to deliver minimally invasive surgery to revive basic patients. I hope the following quote from Dr. Leitao and team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering in their recent paper on da Vinci news in hysterectomy gives you some sense of the value Intuitive brings to the surgical community. “The key conclusion from our data in conjunction with other published data is that the cost of robotics much take into account, how it affects the rate of laparotomy and not just compare successfully completed robotic to laparoscopic cases, because these are both minimally invasive approaches using different instrumentation. Also it's important to take into account post discharge cost outcomes. Our data further validate and support the data from (indiscernible) and colleagues, enhancement of laparoscopic programs with the introduction of the robotic platform and a concomitant decrease in laparotomy rates reached a cost neutralization of the robotic platform and potentially of cost savings overall. The offers continue despite nearly 40 years of availability. Laparoscopic hysterectomy still comprises only a small percentage of all hysterectomies in the United States and the world. There are gynecologic surgeons who provide safe and efficient laparoscopic surgery, it is important to continue to support their efforts. Unfortunately they only represent a minority of all gynecologic surgeons. The robotic platform is a device that overcomes some of the limitations of standard laparoscopic instrumentation and has increased minimally invasive approaches.” In closing we’re steadfast in our conviction in the value da Vinci has and can bring to medicine, and we thank you for your support in helping Intuitive expand the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. That concludes today's call. And I look forward to speaking with you again in three months.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Fourth Quarter Earnings Release. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later on, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to our host, Senior Director of Finance, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Clingan, Director of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, included in our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2013, and our Form 10-Q filed on July 22, 2013. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results. Patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights and I will provide our financial outlook for 2014. Finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2013 was a challenging year for Intuitive. Trends that emerged in the second quarter of 2013 continued through the balance of the year, including revenue uncertainties for United States customers due to pressure on gynecology surgery broadly, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and confusion surrounding the public debate regarding some da Vinci procedures. These factors resulted in the slowing of our growth in gynecology and a subsequent decline in the sale of systems in the United States. The year also featured several strengths in our business. Among them, the publication of several large studies supporting the clinical and economic value of da Vinci use. We also experienced the acceleration of procedure growth in Europe and Japan, broad based growth in general surgery procedures in the United States and continued adoption of our new products worldwide. I will start with a review of procedures. Year-over-year growth in procedures closed at 16%, led by growing use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, accelerating growth in the use of da Vinci outside of the United States and continued uptick in U.S. gynecology. General surgery growth in the United States was 93% in the year, including increased use of da Vinci in colorectal surgery and cholecystectomy using da Vinci Single-Site and Firefly, as well as growth in other general surgery procedures. In the fourth quarter, general surgery overtook urology as the second largest category of da Vinci use in the United States. Outside of the United States, procedure growth accelerated, rising 21% over procedures in 2012 based on strength in Europe and Japan. We will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. Looking at trends in capital sales for the year. Procedures deceleration in the United States freed capacity on already installed systems. Combined with a lack of visibility of revenue for our customers due to pressure on gynecologic surgery and Affordable Care Act, U.S. capital sales fell for the year. Outside of the United States, our capital business in Europe and Asia performed very well with international systems revenue growing 59% over 2012. Investments in Europe have yielded solid results and we expect to continue to grow our European team given the large opportunity we see for da Vinci use in several procedures and countries. As we have mentioned on prior,calls sustained growth in our business in Japan depends upon approval for reimbursement for additional procedures, which is targeted for the 2016 revisions in national insurance coverage. Until additional procedure reimbursement is received in Japan, capital sales are likely to be constrained and to vary in timing. The combination of gynecology trends and the ACA implementation in the United States and uncertainty of future capital purchases in Japan creates difficulty in revenue forecast for at least the first half of 2014. Calvin will take you through our view of 2014 later in the call. Our product launches proceeded well in 2013 and reflect the growing segmentation of our business. The combination of enabling technology, procedure opportunity and aligned economics is important. In the higher volume benign segment we serve, our Single-Site kit of instruments and accessories are being used increasingly for hysterectomy as well as cholecystectomy. We plan on rolling out our Single-Site kit for hysterectomy more broadly in 2014 and are working on a wristed, Single-Site needle driver to augment our existing offering. We anticipate submitting the wristed Single-Site needle driver 510(k) in the first half of 2014. In 2013, we received a (inaudible) visualization indication for our Firefly Fluorescence Imaging Vision System in the third quarter, enabling enhanced visualization of anatomy during cholecystectomy. Firefly use in biliary imaging grew nicely in the fourth quarter. Turning to products used for procedures typically performed through an open incision. Our focus has been on creating products that improve visualization, precision and control for surgeons performing these procedures. Taking colorectal surgery as an example, open colorectal surgery is hard on patients with high complication, morbidity, mortality, and readmission rates compared with minimally invasive surgery. We now offer colorectal surgeon the combination of wristed vessel sealing, wristed stapling and Firefly perfusion imaging. The combination of these technologies with the base capability of da Vinci's powerful and enabling minimally invasive colorectal surgery for a larger patient population. Looking at each product individually. Our Vessel Sealer was cleared for use in Korea in Q3, in Japan in Q4 of 2013 and feedback from general surgeons and gynecologists has been positive. We are also pleased with the performance of our da Vinci Stapler in 2013. With outstanding feedback from customers on the clinical performance, ease-of-use and Smart Clamp feature, we expect most use of our current Stapler to be in colorectal procedures. We are currently expanding our rollout of the Stapler to general surgery customers in the United States. A brief aside, you may have seen the press release yesterday Luna Innovations announcing our acquisition of their Shape-Sensing business for medical use. We have worked with Luna for several years and believe the sensing technology and the team that invented it, represent a foundation for new sites for new types of flexible mechanisms that can augment or expand our products. This is part of a long-term effort by Intuitive to innovate and reducing invasiveness in the access to the body and we do not expect it to materially impact our business in 2014. Looking back at the full year 2013, our operating performance follows. Worldwide procedures grew by approximately 16%. We sold 546 da Vinci Surgical systems in the year, down from 620. Total revenue grew to $2,265 billion, up 4% over 2012. Recurring revenue grew to 1,430 billion, up 15% and comprising 63% of total revenue. We generated $1,021 billion in operating profit before non-cash stock compensation expense, down 1% from last year. GAAP net income grew to $671 million, up 2% year-over-year and we reduced our shares outstanding by repurchasing 2.6 million shares during 2013. Finally, we generated $880 million in cash flows from operations, ending the year with $2.8 billion in cash and investments. Turning to our operating performance for the fourth quarter, procedures grew approximately 12% over the fourth quarter of last year. We sold 138 da Vinci Surgical systems, down from 175 in the fourth quarter of 2012. Total revenue for the quarter was $576 million, down 5% from the prior year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $268 million, up 6%. We generated an operating profit of $250 million in the quarter before non-cash stock option expense, down 13% from the fourth quarter of last year and GAAP net income decreased to $166 million, down 5%. In 2013, we opened two new technology training centers in the United States, one at our headquarters in Sunnyvale and the other in Atlanta. We ended the year with 2,792 members on our team and anticipate growing our organization in specific areas through 2014, with a particular emphasis on Asia and Europe. For reviewing our priorities for authorities for 2014, I will take a moment to touch on our mission. In the face of near-term pressure and scrutiny, our commitment to our mission to fundamentally improve surgery remains unshaken. Around the globe, surgery for many complex conditions still conducted through an open incision with serious risks of complications morbidity, mortality, readmission and prolonged recovery. Despite their long availability, conventional MIS technologies are difficult to apply to some patient populations. And the advanced skills required to use them for complex procedures are hard to master. da Vinci has overcome these limitations of our targeted procedures with proven results. Furthermore, today's minimally invasive surgery still leaves room for improvement in outcomes, predictability, recovery in economics. Taken together, these opportunities are the focus of our current and future product development efforts. Our team has weathered 2013 well and is fully engaged in the challenge of providing tools that improve the experience of surgery for those who need it. Looking to 2014, our priorities are as follows. First, we will focus on the expanded use of da Vinci and general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and single incision surgery. Second, we will support growth of da Vinci used in gynecology and urology worldwide. Third, we will broaden our stapling and Single-Site launches could find introduction of a wristed, Single-Site instrument and finally we will continue to strengthen our capabilities in international markets, particularly Europe and Japan. Before passing the time over to Marshall, I would like to take a moment to thank Aleks Cukic for his outstanding service to this group. Aleks will continue to work with the company in an advisory capacity, but will no longer on these calls. We welcome Patrick Clingan for this role. Many of you know Patrick already and he has ably represented us. With that, I turn the call over to Marshall. Who review financial highlights.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our fourth quarter 2013 revenue and procedures were consistent with our press release issued on January 14th. Fourth quarter revenues were $576 million, down 5%, compared with $609 million for the fourth quarter 2012 and up 15% last quarter. Procedures for the fourth grew approximately 12%, compared with fourth quarter 2012, and approximately 8% compared with last quarter. Procedure highlights will be covered by Patrick. Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue grew 6%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 and 12% compared to the third quarter of 2013. The increase relative to the prior year reflects procedure growth and sales of new products, including Single-Site, Vessel Sealer and Firefly, partially offset by lower instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with fewer system sales. The change from quarter reflects procedure growth in the sales of new products. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,930 per procedure, compared with $2,050 in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $1,860 last quarter. The decrease in the prior year reflects fewer stocking orders associated with fewer system sales, partially offset by new product sales. The increase from the prior quarter primarily reflects new products sales and the timing of customer orders. Systems revenue of $205 million decreased 23% compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 and increased 29% compared with the third quarter 2013. The decline in systems revenue primarily reflects fewer system sales in the U.S., partially offset by higher system sales outside of the U.S. In U.S., we sold 72 systems in the fourth quarter, compared with 133 systems in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 66 systems in the third quarter of 2013. The decline in U.S. system sales relative to the fourth quarter of 2012 reflects the impact of lower procedure growth, spending uncertainties associated with the Affordable Care Act and confusion surrounding the public debate regarding some da Vinci procedures. The increase relative to the third quarter of 2013 reflect seasonality, and increased sales of our Si-e product. As benign condition procedures are becoming a larger portion of our procedure mix in the U.S., we are experiencing demand for lower-cost system for use and reimbursement of the benign conditions and patient settings. As a result, we sold 20 Si-e with prices between $1 million to $1.2 million, depending on the configuration. Globally, our system ASP of $1,455,000 declined relative to the third quarter system ASP of $1,556,000. The decline reflects a higher portion of Si-e systems in the U.S. partially offset by geographic mix and a higher mix of dual console systems. In the fourth quarter, we sold 38 dual console systems compared with 32 systems in the third quarter. Outside the U.S., we sold 66 systems in the fourth quarter, including 28 in to Europe and 21 into Japan, compared with 42 in to international markets in the fourth quarter of 2012, which included 24 in Europe and 10 in Japan and 36 systems in international markets in the third quarter of 2013 which included 17 in to Europe and 13 in to Japan. Fourth quarter system sales also included eight into Korea, seven into Italy, five into France and seven into the Nordic countries. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the fourth quarter 2013 was 69.1% compared with 71.9% for the fourth quarter of 2012 and 71.5% for the third quarter of 2013. Our lower margin percentage reflects expensing certain system production cost in light of lower system unit production. Fourth quarter 2013 operating expenses of $189 million were approximately the same as the fourth quarter of 2012 and we are up 4% compared with last quarter. Our fourth quarter 2013 operating expense compared to 2012 operating expenses reflects headcount additions, offset by lower incentive compensation and lower R&D prototype expenses. Our increase compared to last quarter was driven by higher R&D prototype costs, severance costs and increased headcount partially offset by lower stock compensation cost. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.5% compared with 30.5% for the fourth quarter of 2012 and 12% last quarter. The third quarter of 2012 tax rate benefited from the release of reserves specific to tax years with the statute of limitations have now expired. The fourth quarter of 2013 rate benefited from a greater proportion of our pretax income coming from outside U.S. where our tax rates are lower. Our net income was $166 million or $4.28 per share, compared with $175 million or $4.25 per share for the fourth quarter of 2012 and $157 million or $3.99 per share for the third quarter of 2013. Excluding one-time tax benefits, our third 2013 net income would have been $131 million, or $3.32 per share. An important measure of our performance is cash flow from operations. We define cash flow from operations as net income, excluding after-tax, non-cash compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We will refer to this as non-GAAP net income. For the fourth quarter 2013, we generated $193 million in non-GAAP net income or $4.98 per share, compared with $205 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter 2012. The year ended December 31, 2013, we generated $795 million in non-GAAP net income, or $19.83 per share, compared with $777 million or $18.91 per share last year. We will be providing the statistic to you going forward. We ended the year with cash and investments $2.8 billion, up $222 million compared with September 30, 2013. This increase was primarily driven by net cash provided by operating activities during the year. We repurchased 2.6 million shares for $1.1 billion at an average stock price of $429 per share. As of December 31, we still have 1 billion of share buybacks authorized. With that, I would like to turn it over to Patrick to go over our marketing and clinical highlights.
Patrick Clingan: Thanks, Marshall. Q4 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 12%, which was led by U.S. general surgery and international procedures. In the U.S. general surgery was paced cholecystectomy, colorectal resections in a wide variety of emerging procedures, reflecting the interest in da Vinci surgery among different specialties within general surgery. U.S. urology continues to show signs of stabilization as modest declines in dVP or nearly offset by growth in treatment for kidney cancer. As expected, the growth rate for U.S. benign GYN procedures was down from Q3, which continued to place pressure on U.S. system sales. Q4 international procedure growth of 23%, led by urology, with contributions with GYN and General surgery, dVP update in Europe and Japan was robust accelerating in the back of 2013. During the fourth quarter, robust seller in fact 2013. During the fourth quarter. International dVP volume surpass U.S. dVP volumes despite representing approximately 30% penetration in key developed markets. Earlier this month, the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, published an update to its 2008 to 2000 clinical highlights on prostate cancer, which recommends consideration of robotic surgery in the treatment of prostate cancer. The recommendation also states that surgical treatments of localized prostate cancer are cost-effective by basing them in centers that are expected to perform 150 procedures per year. As Gary mentioned, our U.S. customers are increasingly segmenting our business between less complex benign and complex for cancer procedures and we are pursuing strategy to realize the opportunities with the new segments. The adoption of da Vinci surgery in less benign procedures has changed our procedure mix, growing from approximately 40% to approximately 60% of our U.S. procedures over the past three years. In order to provide solutions for customers to address lower reimbursements and alternate types of care, we have launched products such as Single-Site and Si-e. Single-Site instruments are lower cost, enabling to offer the advantages of robotic surgery and the lower instrument price. The addition wristed needle driver to the Single-Site product family will optimize this technology for additional procedures beginning with benign hysterectomy. Single-Site surgery provides an alternative to traditional approaches, for procedures that are being performed in a minimally invasive manner. However, the push by robotic surgeons in the less complex benign procedures is not simply about patient choice, but the potential for safer outcomes. Following our September 5 10-K approval Firefly biliary imaging, we have witnessed acceleration in these options of Fluorescence Imaging during da Vinci cholecystectomy as firefly enabled visualization of the biliary. It cannot be the underlying life. During the fourth quarter, Firefly was included on 80% of the U.S. Si-e system placements. While the available capacity on our existing installed base that served as a headwind to 2013 system sales. Not all capacity in the right location. This industry-wide shift in surgeries from in-patient to outpatient setting has led some hospitals to pursue a robotic surgery in an outpatient setting. We believe our Si-e is suited to meet the needs of these hospitals. At the other end of the spectrum, we believe the value proposition and evidence base supporting conversion of complex and cancer surgeries from open to MIS is growing increasingly clear. Traditional minimally invasive tools have attempted to make inroads in to these procedures for decades but the technical complexity and challenging patient anatomy has limited adoption. We believe da Vinci surgery represents an evolution in minimally invasive technology that can expand MIS more deeply into a number of traditionally open procedures. Given the high value we bring to converting complex open surgery to MIS, we are seeing increased global interest in our fully featured systems and advanced instrumentation. Vessel sealing and stapling technologies are important tools for colorectal surgeons and with our Stapler entering full launch mode in the U.S., we believe we are well suited to drive adoption for colorectal resections. We believe there are more open colorectal resections and prostatectomy than malignant hysterectomy combined and we believe our vessel sealing, stapling and Firefly technologies bring a powerful array of tools to enable deeper penetration of MIS into colorectal surgery. During the quarter, we continued to see growth in peer-reviewed publications, highlighting robotic surgery in a number of journals. I will take a moment to highlight just a few. Dr. Davis from MD Anderson authored a multi-institution database study in the December issue of Journal of Endourology evaluated over 71,000 plus technique patients from 2004 to 2010. This paper showed da Vinci surgery has a shorter hospital stay and lower rate of complications compared to open surgery, even for surgeons in their initial 25 procedures. We believe these outcomes reflect the value created by the totality of resources available for safely training surgeons on da Vinci. Turning to GYN and specifically to benign hysterectomy. While near-term ACA implementation creates some uncertainty among our customers, this study supports that da Vinci surgery aligns with the underlying principles of healthcare reform. August and the October version of The Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology, Dr. Martino and colleagues from the Lehigh Valley Health Network presented results covering more than 2,500 benign hysterectomies, across all four surgical modalities, robotic, laparoscopic, vaginal and abdominal. The authors concluded that da Vinci benign hysterectomy had a statistically significantly lower rate of 30-day readmission as well as reduced blood loss and length of stay compared to the other three modalities of care. Moving back to urology. A national database study of approximately 5,500 prostatectomy patients published by Dr. Polecki [ph] of Northwestern in the November Journal of Endourology. This study reported statistically significant results for robotic surgery, including a total complication rate of 6% da Vinci versus 23% for open surgery, a surgical complication rate of 1% for da Vinci versus 3% for open surgery, and readmission rate of 3.5% for da Vinci versus 5.5% for open surgery. These results came at cost of an additional 38 minutes of operative time for da Vinci. Finally, we will conclude with the largest national database study on colon resection. Originated from Dr. Juo and colleagues at Johns Hopkins, they studied 244,000 U.S. surgeries from in 2008 to 2010. This paper published in the December edition of JAMA showed minimally invasive colon resections offered lower mortality rates, lower complication rate, shorter length of stay and reduced cost compared to open surgery. Robotic surgery represents less than 1% of the colectomies performed in this dataset. When comparing the smaller cohort to laparoscopy, there were two statistically significant outcomes in favor of robotics, reduced hospital stay and lower conversion rate, while cost statistically significantly favored laparoscopy. The authors concluded that robotic surgery was similar to laparoscopy with a higher cost but noticed that less than 50% of colon resections within this study were performed laparoscopy in 2010. The authors could not include rectal resections in this study which are notably absent given the proportion of open surgery. We encourage you look closely at the underlying data and consider the opportunity for da Vinci surgery to expand MIS for colon resections as adoption grows among colorectal surgeon. Please visit the clinical evidence section of our website to learn more about these and other publications regarding the da Vinci surgery. Thank you for your time and I will now turn the call over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our financial outlook for 2014. Starting with procedures. In 2013, total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 16% to roughly 523,000 procedures performed worldwide. We exited 2013 with fourth quarter procedures up approximately 12% versus the prior year. During 2014, we anticipate a stabilization of the procedure growth rate with the full year procedures growing within a range of approximately 9% to 12%. Based on an increasing proportion of benign procedures in our procedure mix, we anticipate a more pronounced quarterly seasonality impact in the upcoming first quarter 2014. Moving to revenues, as has been discussed earlier, several factors are pressuring our business, making it difficult in the near-term for us to predict system sales volumes, and as a consequence, total revenue. As we enter 2014, our visibility into system sales is challenged by the breadth of the range of our procedure growth forecast. As a reminder, procedures drive capital sales and the relationship between procedure growth rates and capital sales is highly sensitive. Economic pressure and uncertainty at hospital associated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, evolving utilization patterns and point-of-care dynamics as described by Patrick earlier in the call and likely variability and the timing of Japan, system sales given the time until additional procedure reimbursement anticipated in 2016. Given our capital sales performance in the back half of 2013, and the persistence of some of the issues described above, it is likely that we will sell fewer systems and 2014 in the 546 systems sold in 2013. Due to limited visibility regarding the capital side of our business, we will not be providing revenue forecast at this time. As we gain greater visibility, it is our intention to reinstate revenue guidance. We believe deeply in our ability to fundamentally improve surgery and are pursuing plans to increase the use of da Vinci-enabled MIS around the globe. As a result, 2014 will be a year of increased investment for Intuitive Surgical, even during this upcoming period of capital sales uncertainty. We will be building our international capabilities, investing in new product development and pursuing growth in both of our procedures businesses' segments. In 2014, we plan to grow our operating expenses roughly 12% to 15% above 2013 levels. We expect our non-cash stock compensation to range between $180 million and $190 million in 2014, compared to $169 million in 2013. We expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $15 million and $20 million in 2014. With regard to income tax, we expect our 2014 income tax rate to be between 25% and 28% of pre-tax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. This forecast does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2014. Our share count for calculating diluted EPS in Q4 2013 was approximately 38.8 million shares, declining 500,000 shares in the quarter, primarily due to the full quarter impact of Q3 buybacks. Our actual Q1 and fiscal year 2014 share count will depend on several factors, including the magnitude and timing of any additional share buybacks. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush.
Tao Levy -Wedbush: Hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions on my end, obviously, the decision not to provide full year guidance leads us a little bit I guess not necessarily confused, but struggling to figure out where our number should end up this year especially given all the volatility. Would you maybe comment on the comfort that you feel around sort of where the consensus is that at this moment of your top line or do you stay away from that type of guidance?
Gary Guthart: Not clear where consensus will wind up, so I think try and project where that will go and I think it's probably not worth speculating on the call. I think we laid out the underlying dynamics that have produced near-term visibility through the script pretty well and if we had greater visibility on that, we would share it with you. I think that the looking out at what the in-patient admissions will be for the benign procedures we serve and what those dynamics will be has been moving around looking at how hospitals model their revenues in the face of ACA in that benign segment that we operate in and then trying to predict what Japan will do. We have an operating plan. We understand where we are going. We are disciplined about what we expected to do in terms of activity, but this is a wide range and so rather than speculate, I think this is where we are.
Tao Levy -Wedbush: Okay, and I think at the beginning of the script, you had mentioned that there is more concern around first half of the year, specifically on capital system placements. Is this something that happens at the middle of the year, back half of the year that would get you more comfortable?
Gary Guthart: I don't think its an advance. I think its more around as we see how patient flows are going to our customers, although they will have a better view and as their view improves, our view improves. I think it is really as simple as that.
Tao Levy -Wedbush: Okay, and just lastly, anyway you can talk about level of their profitability of Si-e system versus the Si given that that's becoming a bigger part of your mix? Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Well, I will as Marshall to take you through a little bit of what framing looks like and my only comment before he jumps in is, beware of averaging. There is now multiple products in the line and the average is not necessarily predictive of what's going on underneath.
Marshall Mohr: So just as I said in the call, the average pricing that we receive for Si-e's was between about $1 million, $1.2 million depending on the configuration that's obviously lower than an Si with four arms. The Si-e does only have three arms and so it does not cost the same amount of money to produce. The gross margins are several points below. It is six, seven points below what they are for Si systems. It's able to open benign procedures for us. It is clearly an outpatient settings, we are upward.
Tao Levy -Wedbush: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will go to the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just following up on the last one. What should we be thinking about in terms of a run rate for Si-e placements and maybe could you also discuss on your pricing assumptions that you are thinking about for '14 overall?
Gary Guthart: So we really have, if you go back, we sold three in the first quarter, two in the second quarter, two in the third quarter and then we sold 21 total. There are 20 in U.S., 21 total. To me, that's one quarter of success in selling it to customers that are looking for a lower cost system for benign conditions. I think I don't have enough data to really predict exactly how many we will be selling every quarter. So I am not going to go there.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Okay, and then can you comment on your pricing assumptions for '14?
Marshall Mohr: Yes. I assume you mean the system pricing assumptions, and like Gary said, here it is really important to be aware of the averages. If you look at it overall, our ASP was about $1.5 million in both the full year of 2012 and 2013 and in Q4 our ASP declines to $1.455 million as we saw this significant increase in the lower-priced three arm Si-e's. As you know, these Si-e's are targeted towards a growing procedures segment of Single-Site and less complex procedures and in 2014 we will remain focused on ongoing these procedure category with more Si-e system sales but also as was mentioned at the same time, the proportion of the higher featured dual console and Firefly systems also increased in 2013 and furthermore the systems that went to Japan's in strong numbers were higher. So I guess the point of it is, now going forward the ASPs will potentially vary more significantly quarter-to-quarter based upon this broader pricing mix and I will just fall short of trying to guess which way it is going to go.
Gary Guthart: One comment I guess I would add for a little clarity there. I don't think with any sub-segment, the ASPs are going to fluctuate that much. It's a mix of those sub-segments that makes it predictive.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Okay. That's helpful. Then on Japan, it sounds like we should assume that you had a replacements here and that's going to slow a little bit. Is that the right way to be thinking about it for '14?
Gary Guthart: The timing of it is very hard to predict, but we have '14 and '15 before the next round of a broad national reimbursement. There may be hospitals that get individual redemptions to collect data, but broadly, there will be some time and so figuring out how much absorption there will be in Japan over that two-year period as it's just very hard to model, so looks likely it's hard to predict, but over time. I think it's going to be constrained and so directionally, I do not think you will keep selling systems at a very high rate and so that constraint is broken with reimbursement.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Last one you talked about, we are having to reinvest it this year, you had a small headcount reduction at the end of last year. Should we be thinking about headcount being up and talk - if you look at more specifically if you can on where those investments are being made? You need to build the channel ambulatory markets for example.
Gary Guthart: Good question, so we had a small reduction in our U.S. Sales force at the end of the year. It was about 50 people just for those who maybe listening to the haven heard this conversation. We had a team that had grown that was layered on top of our main course design to pursue gynecology. As gynecology has matured in the U.S. they were in essence double serving those accounts, so we hold them back into the main force, but that's was 50 out of a commercial force of about [800]. We anticipate growing forward in the year in a few places. Europe, we continue to see investment in our organization there. In Asia, more broadly we will invest in that opportunity and in our channel there. In the U.S., in product development, we will continue investments and other parts of operations. I think headcount growth will continue through the year. I won't be a sharp increase, but I think that it will be targeted where we needed. With regard to how we discuss opportunities with hospital customers in terms of standard of care. we think our capital sales team is well positioned to start the year here to have those conversations.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will move to the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: Thank you and good afternoon. I also wanted to point out that it's very helpful all the disclosure you are giving on the website now it takes time to add that all together, so thank you for that. My question I wanted to just take a step back for a second if you look at the overall U.S. market and what transpired this year. I guess in some ways when I look at the trending capital that this could have - this could have happened to any point in time as procedures slow, what I am trying to reconcile that you had a modest slowing in procedure volumes, but a very significant drop off in capital, so I am just wondering if you could talk about why we should think of is overcapacity in the and that you have penetrated just a large segment of the addressable market here and there is going to be sort of a normalization period until procedure volume picks backup.
Gary Guthart: Let me start and Calvin, you can jump in. I think a couple of things to know underlying capital sales are really three factors and U.K. and a couple, but one of them is procedure capacity and that's a highly sense development so that just a percent change in procedure growth rate can free about 20 worth capacity give or take not on an exact number, so there is a high sensitivity there since capacity is highly sensitive to the growth rate. That's one element. Second element is, do hospital customers feel they have the right technologies to pursue the opportunity that's in front of them, so if they have enough system and they want to pursue colorectal or Single-Site, then there is an upgrade opportunities for them to move up and Si. Then Patrick pointed out in section that not always this is not always in the same awkward so that if hospitals are doing benign procedures in a different point ambulatory surgery environment. It is not the same sort of aura, so while they have capacity in one place, it's not necessarily in the right place and so those three things are underlying, what happens and one of them sensitive procedure volume. The other two one sensitive technology one is point-of-care. Calvin?
Calvin Darling: Yes. I mean I don't have much to add to that other than just to acknowledge that prior to 2013, we had really a longstanding history of gradually increasing utilization per system and it is true that based upon the issues that we described, we had a modest decrease in utilization, average utilization. Again, be aware of averages in 2013, but again capacity is really just one of the factors involved in system acquisitions by hospitals.
Gary Guthart: To finish the thought to acknowledge your question, I think procedures are the number one. Of the three things, procedures are very important and procedure growth rate is important and it's something we are focused on.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: Okay, that's helpful. Then maybe just a follow-up. As you are think about the operating profile of the business from a profitability standpoint, I know you have talked a lot about being focused on topline growth and while your margins have come down they are still very high, particularly on a cash basis, so can you maybe just talk about how you are thinking about P&L leverage versus efforts you are undertaking to re-stimulate topline growth? I would assume that at this point, resumption of topline growth is the priority and that you have financial levers to help protect earnings? Or am I not thinking about that the right way?
Gary Guthart: I will start and Marshall can chime in. I think the first thing is, we will manage the business for the long-term and we will look around and say, the mission of the company and the way we ought to be evaluated is, are we satisfying the mission of improving surgery in the areas and markets that we can do that and I think there's a lot of opportunity for us and we will pursue that. Fiscal discipline is important and I think it's important in two ways. One is, spending discipline is important to make sure that we are careful about where we spend. And investment discipline is important. In this period of time we will invest. We will invest in a disciplined way but we think that the opportunity ahead of the company to make surgery better is substantial and we are in a great position to do it and I think pulling back that set of investments in the face of some near term uncertainty would not be in the long term interest of the company. So that's how we look at it. In terms of operating levers, they are sort of near term and long term and I will let Marshall talk to that.
Marshall Mohr: Some operating levers, they operate on their own. What I mean by that is commission, a large portion of our cost base is variable. It varies with revenue. So even in the SG&A category, a large portion is commission based and so as revenue fluctuates so does the amount of costs that we have but otherwise, I think Gary outlined, that some of the other things. I think that we have some levers but we are going to continue to invest in our future.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: I got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will go to the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Margaret Kaczor - William Blair: Good afternoon, guys. It's actually Margaret this time. Thanks for taking my questions. Gary, as we look at the opportunity in colorectal in 2014 and as you kind of look at the current system and the current tool set, do you think that can get you to the procedure growth guidance that at least you are modeling internally, if not giving to us? Then how do you view the rate of penetration in general surgery over the next several years and 2014? Is it going to be similar to dVP, dVH or slower? Any clarity would be helpful?
Gary Guthart: I will speak to the first one. The second question has a few moving parts. On the first one, we think that the set of Vessel Sealer, Stapler. As you know, Stapler has a whole marketplace. It is quite broad in terms of the number of sub-products in the stapling family. Our first offering is targeted at colorectal and the feedback on that has been great and then perfusion imaging with Firefly. Those three things together combined with da Vinci is really powerful and a great staring point. It will not be the last set of things we do in general surgery, but we think it's powerful and I think that it is in a good position to power the growth that we are seeing in colorectal surgery here and then later in the markets outside the United States. In terms of what that looks like for total colorectal as a whole, I think we are early in the adoption but I think we will have a real opportunity for growth there. You had said how do we think about general surgery growth rates as a whole, and I will give you one framework that I think is important. We have gynecology and urology as precedents. In urology, prostatectomy was really the lead procedure and there are just a few procedures that followed it, kidney cancer treatment in partial nephrectomy, bladder cancer treatment in cystectomy. So it's not a huge broad set. Gynecology is little bit broader but hysterectomy was really the leading growth engine and then some other procedures behind it, myomectomy and sacral colpopexy, pelvic reconstruction. General surgery does not quite have that same structure. There are subspecialties that are quite broad. So you have colorectal subspecialty. You have foregut procedures. You have bariatric surgery. What the folks do in academic centers is quite different than what they do in community centers. So the category, as a whole, is going to be the sum of adoptions in different places. The sum of adoption in Single-Site, the sum of adoption in colorectal and those are a really different. Single-Site is largely done in community settings, cholecystectomies are, colorectal procedures are largely concentrated in cancer hospitals and so those different growth rates, they differ. How they add up? I think is a little bit hard to predict. Patrick or Calvin, anything you would like to add?
Margaret Kaczor - William Blair: Is there something on the learning curve that can maybe speed that up as you come out with kind of new add-ons toolsets and so on to help drive general surgery?
Gary Guthart: I think that the new instruments that we are bringing in, I think the broadening of the launch of Stapling and the use of Firefly, those are enabling technologies. They speed the efficiency of the procedure, they allow a better workflow so I think that's helpful. The investments we have made in our training centers are really to make for easy access for learnings surgeons that have access to resources and I think that's been a good investment for us and that can help the investments we have made in simulation and access to simulation are other things that I think help. We are really happy and feel that the data study is important in showing that the totality of learning resources for surgeons. It's not just what Intuitive does, what Proctors do, what advanced [work] does, has resulted in great and safe adoption of new technology, and I think that's a powerful message and likely to be repeated in other disciplines beyond just prostatectomy.
Margaret Kaczor - William Blair: Okay, then on the gynecology side. You guys are clearly, fairly well penetrated in hysterectomy and kind of some of the other ancillary procedures and the phacos, so how should we think about that as a category now that it's over 50% penetrated? Should it materially slow in 2014? Gradual changes and then could Single-Site actually become quickly material? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: Fair question. I think, and you know this well, I know your team knows this well. Once you are on these adoption curves, the year-over-year growth rate falls, that's just the nature of those adoption curves On the multi-port side, I would expect that it continues in the U.S. but there is a continued deceleration the pace of which will be hard to predict and we will see. Single-Site hysterectomy is an opportunity. We are early in that opportunity, we have been in limited launch. The limited launch has gone very well clinically and it's gone really well from uptake in the way surgeons who are being trained have adopted it. We are adding some instruments into that kit, bringing back some listed instruments that will we think optimize the procedure and give surgeons a little more flexibility in approaching tissue and we are working through those things. I think that's a well known pathway for us and we think that will help. That's still early. We are not into a full very broad launch there. Although we have broadened the launch from its early days, really starting in the fourth quarter and continuing through here, so I think that launch will open up through the year Single-Site hysterectomy and we will continue to report on it to you as to how we progress.
Calvin Darling: I would just add, we still feel we have a significant opportunity here in Women's health, specifically hysterectomy on the more complex multi-port side. There are over 100,000 women now are still having open hysterectomies in the United States, so we think our technology can improve their outcomes. Then we are very early on the less complex side, on our Single-Site offering where there is something like 200,000 laparoscopic in vaginal procedures that perhaps you would have a place there.
Margaret Kaczor - William Blair: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will go to the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.
Bob Hopkins - Bank of America: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?
Gary Guthart: We can.
Bob Hopkins - Bank of America: Great. Just a couple on the guidance. I heard your comments about operating expenses for the year, but I was wondering if you had any comments on gross margins, both as it relates to 2014, and then given some of the changes in the customer mix longer term, just any longer-term thoughts on gross margin as well? Again for '14 and then longer term any thoughts on gross margin?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I think you saw in the fourth quarter there were some points there were mentioned first off, the margin the gross margin was impacted by lower production volumes which, when you divide some of the manufacturing cost by fewer units of production, that has a negative impact on margin, and so you saw that. Could that be a continuing headwind to some extent I would say yes. Beyond that, you come down to some of the product mix discussions on gross margin that I think, we are not predicting how much is going to be Si-e versus four arm Si. Geographic, I think it's too many moving parts to make a prediction there on that.
Gary Guthart: I think you would ask kind of a longer-term question, directionally how do we think about it. And I think as we look at the opportunities and we talk about segmentation of the business, we want to match the clinical and technical capability of the products we bring, the procedure opportunity and the underlying economics of those procedures together. We think we have opportunities to do that and we think it's really in the best interest of the company to do it. I think we can get to an attractive margin profile in both segments. Some of that is near term and some of that is long-term in terms of investments and products. So we will do that.
Bob Hopkins - Bank of America: Then on the decision on the revenue guidance, or lack thereof, for 2014, I just want to ask a little bit about that, because you guys have always been so adamant about saying that system sales are driven by procedure volume and you are willing to give procedure volume numbers, but not some thoughts on system sales. So I am wondering, if there is anything sort of different in that relationship going forward. In other words, we have historically assumed that utilization just has to go up and that's the way we have tried to predict your system sales. Is there something unique about 2014 that would cause that relationship to bifurcate further? Do we need to assume much greater utilization than we have been seeing in the past in terms of increases and again, just want to ask about that, because you guys have been so adamant about the correlation.
Gary Guthart: I will just maybe start. Two ways to think about it. I think the first one is, the range and procedure guidance is pretty broad relative to the base and because system placements are sensitive to that range, that's a multiplier on the uncertainty. That's one. The second is that, it may be that utilization trends differ over time just because of point of care, as Patrick had mentioned pretty clearly, and because hospitals may look out and say I want greater capital utilization of what I have got, and I am willing to make some compromises and convenience to get that. We may see those two different things that work against each other and so how that plays out. What I would say on that second half is that, those changes are unlikely to switch on a dime, because they are operational in nature. You have to move, you have to adjust hospital operations to make it happen. So that may happen, but I don't think that happens the day after tomorrow. I think that's something that would play out in time.
Patrick Clingan: To add to what Gary said, you are right. We do believe that procedures will drive systems in the long-term. So there's going to be short-term fluctuations in capital sales, but overall long-term, in mature markets you are going to see capital sales will catch up over time. Having said that, in nascent markets like Japan, which also causes our overall utilization statistic to fluctuate, we are selling systems ahead of procedures and so that one's more difficult to predict.
Bob Hopkins - Bank of America: And then lastly, you guys have again talked about the opportunity for outpatient, more benign type procedures. Can you just help us think about how big of an opportunity that might be for the company? I assume today your sales into outpatient surgery centers and centers like that are pretty minimal. So have you guys given much thought to how big an opportunity that might be?
Gary Guthart: As always, we start with procedures and work our way back rather than thinking about outpatient operating rooms and work our way forward. So Calvin or Patrick can speak to it.
Patrick Clingan: Yes. So if you look at where most of these outpatient surgeries are performed, it's in a hospital outpatient setting. So either within the four walls of the hospital or in an adjacent ambulatory care facility, but the predominance of them are in fact channels as opposed to the physician owned freestanding facilities.
Bob Hopkins - Bank of America: Thank you.
Gary Guthart: We have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. That will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon. Thanks for fitting me in. Gary, I wonder if you could just talk qualitatively about procedures in 2014. I am assuming the two biggest dynamics driving procedure deceleration is one, obviously still very rapid growth in general surgery but maybe slowing off of a large base and then hysterectomy, it's deceleration or stabilization. I wonder, if just very broadly you could help us understand those two buckets? Can general surgery hold its growth rate trend line based on a further or broader launch in minimum invasive in colon rectal? And do you expect dVH to hold its trend line, slightly decelerate or potentially even improve in 2014?
Gary Guthart: Yes, I will start with hysterectomy. I think that the underlying disease state is not changing in the U.S. I don't see any rapid change there. I think the set of treatments that are being offered are also not changing very much. What we seem to be seeing change is payor behavior and kind of patient decision making with that payor behavior and so it's a little bit hard to predict what that will look like, but over time and I think any of the three possibilities you outlined is possible. I think, I look out and Calvin mentioned it as well. There are 100,000 or so open procedures being done. For women in United States for hysterectomy, many of whom are great candidates for proven safer, minimally invasive procedure and yet they are getting open procedures and that is an opportunity, so if that patient population comes in and has an opportunity then that would be a positive and an upside. The other possible upside is of course single incision, Single-Site hysterectomy as that kit rolls out further and we augment it, so those are possible upsides. How payor behavior changes through the year? What some of the patient decision-making looks like? That's a little bit harder to predict. On the general surgery side, as you know the adoption rates are always year-over-year growth rates and adoption curve always highest in the beginning and then they decline over time. As the base grows, it's absolutely a natural progression. The speed of that I think is going to depend on procedure-by-procedure. What is the total available market for single incision cholecystectomy, that's an estimate. Everybody would look at that and try to figure it out. It's not a clear substitution against another one that's just sitting there, so we will see what that looks like. Colorectal, I think, we feel really good about. You look at colorectal and we bring a huge amount of value there. Cholecystectomy, patient enthusiasm, surgeon commitment, training and growth in those procedures has been really encouraging, and the last thing is that general surgery has been growing beyond those two into some other things and we will let them evolve for a couple of quarters, but I think that will be interesting to see where else general surgeons take the opportunity in the technology and it looks to be broader than just those two. Overall, I think our feeling is, we could bring a lot of value to general surgery is high.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Gary, just one quick one on, just so I understand the Si-e, I mean that's system.
Gary Guthart: Make it a quick one.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: This is going to be very quick and I promise even for me. The Si-e it's been available for a while, but it sounds like there is sort of growing enthusiasm, so I am trying to understand that trend line has been relatively stable which is the hard to understand, just obviously because this year larger capitals under pressure, so is the situation with Si-e, you now see better positioning in ambulatory care market, had there been upgrades to that system or is it simply going to be a corporate focus on the Si-e heading into 2014. I am just trying to figure out what's changing relatively given this system has been available. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Yes. Good question, so short answer, combination of a couple of things. The Single-Site instrument kit is both, procedurally adopted to a three-arm system, it's also priced right for that set of procedures. Then Firefly adding into that is a nice mix together that gives kind of a fully capable system to do those things in an ambulatory setting, so I think those combinations bought together helped and I think an organizational alignment around describing the value of that also helps, so that's how we have gotten where we are. Thank you for the question. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organization focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope you are following segment of an editorial by Dr. Tim Wilson, Chief of the Division of Urology and Neurologic Oncology, at the City of Hope Cancer Center gives you some sense of what this means to da Vinci surgeons and their patients. "In this era of health care reform, policymakers, hospitals and providers are all evaluating ways to reduce the overall cost burden to society while improving the quality outcomes for patients. Often lost in the debate is the need for investment in technologies that can help mitigate the significant cost drivers of health care. Robotic-assisted surgery is a game-changing technology in medicine yet it is deeply misunderstood and often dismissed as just another expensive tool for driving costs up. This could not be farther from the truth. The cost of that technology has to be compared with the alternative cost of treatment. Displacing large abdominal incisions that have complications, high rates of death, blood loss, higher risk of infection and higher length of hospital stay is a good investment and aligns with the goals of health care reform. Medicine needs innovation, but usually is slow to change. Decades ago, the same criticisms of robotic surgery plagued laparoscopy. It was expensive, unproven and not safe. To-date, more than 2.1 million da Vinci surgeries have been performed worldwide with an extremely low death rate, a declining rate of adverse events, and a growing body of clinical evidence that demonstrates safety, effectiveness and an ability to reduce both costs and complications of open surgery. As a surgeon who has performed thousands of procedures, including open, manual laparoscopic and robotic-assisted urologic cancer surgeries, I believe robotic-assisted surgery is the kind of technological disruption that truly will reform health care." The improvements in surgery described by Dr. Wilson drive our team and form the foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) Also as a reminder, today’s teleconference is being recorded. And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to our host, Senior Director of Finance for Intuitive Surgical, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead, sir.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, included in our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 4, 2013, and our Form 10-Q filed on July 22, 2013. These filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter's results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, then I will provide an update to our financial forecast for 2013, and finally we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I’ll turn it over to Gary.
Gary S. Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. This quarter we continued to see significant pressure on our U.S. business. Trends that started in the first half of the year in gynecology have continued. On the procedure side underlying causes for slowing growth include weaker overall gynecologic admissions which is pressuring surgical volume. There are also lingering yield founded concerns regarding the benefits of da Vinci Surgery compared to the available surgical alternatives. Since we’re a significant share of hysterectomy, our growth rate is sensitive to these issues. This slow growth has resulted in capacity in our U.S. installed base combined with changes in hospital capital spending associated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, U.S. capital sales fell substantially compared to prior year. Overall procedure trends in the quarter were stable rising 16% over prior year. In the United States general surgery was our fastest growing segment led by Single-Site cholecystectomy and followed by growth in colon and rectal resections. Our gynecology business still grew year-over-year, but at a slower pace than prior quarters and urologic procedures in the U.S. were stable compared to prior year. In Europe, we are continuing our investments in market access in clinical research. We are seeing early positive results in HTA and reimbursement analysis as a consequence of these efforts. Year-over-year procedure growth accelerated led by urology and early growth in malignant gynecology. Growth was strongest in U.K., France, Italy and the Nordic countries. Procedure growth in Asia was solid off a small base led by growth in urology and general surgery. With regard to resolution of our FDA warning letter, we are making good progress in addressing the elements of the letter and the Form 43 that preceded it. As part of our work in responding to the letter, we expect to file corrections and updates to our labeling and to file documentation for some past field actions. These activities will be documented on FDA’s websites over the next several weeks. Turning to our operating performance for the third quarter; procedures grew approximately 16% over the third quarter of 2012. We sold 101 da Vinci Surgical Systems, down from 155 during the third quarter of last year. Total revenue was $499 million, down 7% from last year. Instrument and accessory revenue was $239 million, up 10% over Q3 2012. Total recurring revenue grew to $341 million, up 11% from prior year and comprising 68% of total revenue. Net income was $157 million, down 14% over last year, and we generated an operating profit of $225 million before non-cash stock option expense, down 13% from the third quarter of last year and representing 45% of Q3 revenue. We ended the quarter with $2,532 million in cash and investments, down $495 million from last quarter. In the quarter, we generated $204 million in gross cash flow from operations, and we repurchased $694 million of our stock. Our new products continue to gain acceptance with customers. We expanded our stapling rollout at a measured pace through the first three quarters of this year. Surgeons’ clinical feedback on the Stapler has been strong, and our stapling operations debt has increased substantially. We will accelerate the stapling launch in Q4 and beyond. This quarter, we received FDA clearance for an expanded indication of our Firefly system to include biliary imaging in combination with normal white light imaging during cholecystectomy. This is another step in providing surgeons with imaging capability that enables them to see anatomical structure beyond what can be seen with the naked eye. Our Single-Site product line continues to perform well. Single-Site cholecystectomy is moving out of early adopting centers into the broader clinical practice. Single-Site for hysterectomy progressed during the quarter while on limited release. As part of this limited release, customers have requested an additional instrument, a wrist needle driver to complement the product line. We have designed it, are testing it, and planning to submit an application in early Q1 to the U.S. FDA for 510(k) clearance. We believe the addition of the wrist to Single-Site instruments will optimize the procedure for surgeons who expect EndoWrist functionality. Our Single-Site products are well positioned to deliver increased patient satisfaction with reasonable economics for single incision surgery. We have great confidence in the safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of our products, and we remain deeply positive on the value da Vinci brings to surgery now and in the future. The benefit da Vinci brings as an alternative to open surgery has been demonstrated in hundreds of independent peer-reviewed clinical papers. Increasingly well designed cost studies demonstrate that upfront in operating investments in da Vinci surgery are offset by downstream savings resulting from fewer complications, readmissions, and length of stay. We recently updated intuitivesurgical.com with links to high level of evidenced clinical data and adverse event data, and in the next few days, we’ll add abstracts of well-designed, peer-reviewed cost studies comparing da Vinci surgery to open surgery alternatives. We encourage a full and careful examination of the literature by anyone interested in the facts about da Vinci use. In summary, we continue to see substantial long-term opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery using our technologies, and we are focused on the following. First, educating the surgical community on the facts about da Vinci surgery including its safety, efficacy, and cost of effectiveness; next building da Vinci capability and supporting it’s use in general surgery. Extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery using da Vinci in gynecology and urology worldwide, and disciplined execution and expanding our stapling and Single-Site adoption. I will now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall L. Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our third quarter 2013 revenue was $499 million, down 7% compared with $538 million to the third quarter of 2012, and down 14% from last quarter. Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows; third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $239 million, up 10% compared with $218 million for the third quarter of 2012 and down 10% compared with the second quarter of 2013. The year-over-year increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by procedure growth of approximately 16%. Sales of new products, including Single-Site, Vessel Sealer, and Firefly, partially offset by lower instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with fewer system sales and the timing of customer orders. The sequential decrease in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by lower instrument and accessory stocking orders and the timing of customer orders. The 16% increase in da Vinci procedures for the quarter reflected growth in general surgery and gynecology procedures in the U.S. and urology procedures outside of the U.S. The lower third quarter growth rate reflects slower growth in U.S. benign gynecologic procedures and flat U.S. DVP volumes. Factors effecting U.S. benign gynecologic procedures include reduced hospital admissions, a trend by payers toward encouraging conservative disease management and treatment in out-patient settings and negative media reports. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,860 per procedure compared to $1,980 per procedure in the third quarter of 2012, and $2,020 last quarter. Our third quarter 2013 revenue per procedure reflected fewer stocking orders associated with fewer system sales and the timing of customer orders. Third quarter 2013 systems revenue of $159 million decreased 32% compared with $232 million for the third quarter of 2012 and decreased 27% compared with $216 million last quarter. Overall, we sold 101 systems in the third quarter of 2013 compared with 155 systems last year and 143 systems last quarter. We sold 65 systems into the U.S. market in the third quarter of 2013 compared with 114 systems last year and 90 systems last quarter. The lower third quarter 2013 U.S. system sales reflected among other things the impacts of moderating growth in U.S. benign gynecologic procedures, increased economic pressure on hospitals, uncertainty related to and spending associated with the Affordable Care Act, and negative media reports. During the third quarter of 2013, we sold 36 systems in the international market, including 17 into Europe and 13 into Japan, compared with 41 into international markets in the third quarter of 2012, which included 13 into Europe and 16 into Japan and 53 systems into international markets in the second quarter of 2013, which included 21 into Europe and 20 into Japan. Our third quarter average sales price per system was $1.56 million, compared with $1.48 million realized in the third quarter of 2012 and the $1.5 million realized last quarter. ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators in Firefly when configured with the system and exclude upgrades. Our higher third quarter 2013 ASPs were driven by a higher proportion of dual console configurations and geographic sales mix. 29 of our third quarter 2013 systems involved trade-ins compared with 34 trade-ins last year and 43 trade-ins last quarter. Service revenue increased to $101 million, up 16% compared with $88 million last year and up 3% compared with $98 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was driven by larger system installed base. International revenue results were as follows; third quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $133 million, up 15% compared with revenue of $115 million in the third quarter of last year and down 16% compared with revenue of $158 million last quarter. Our higher year-over-year international revenue was driven by higher recurring instrument, accessory, and service revenue, partially offset by lower system sales. Our lower sequential international revenue primarily reflects summer seasonality. Third quarter 2013 international procedure volume was approximately 25% higher than the third quarter of 2012 and 6% lower than the second quarter of this year. The growth over the prior year reflects DVP growth in Europe and Japan. The decrease compared to last quarter reflects summer seasonality patterns in Europe. Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2013 was 71.5% compared with 72.5% for the third quarter of 2012 and 70% for the second quarter of 2013. Our lower margin percentage compared to the third quarter of last year resulted primarily from the impact of the medical device excise tax or higher gross margin percentage compared to last quarter was driven primarily by higher system ASPs. Third quarter 2013 operating expenses of $183 million were up 2% compared with last year and down 2% compared with last quarter. Our higher year-over-year operating expense was driven by headcount additions, partially offset by lower incentive compensation, and lower R&D prototype expenses, a decrease compared to last quarter was driven by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by stock compensation expenses. Third quarter 2013 operating income was $174 million or 35% of sales compared to $211 million or 39% of sales last year and $219 million or 38% of sales last quarter. Third quarter 2013 operating income included $50 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $47 million last year and $39 million last quarter. The increase in stock compensation expense relative to the prior quarter has to do with the timing of stock option grants in the related testing periods. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 12% compared with 15% for the third quarter of 2012 and 28.6% in last quarter. Both the third quarter of 2013 and the third quarter of 2012 tax rates benefited from the release of reserves specific to tax year where the statutory limitations have now expired. Excluding one-time benefits, our third quarter 2013 tax provision would have been approximately $26 million higher and our third quarter 2012 tax provision would have been approximately $35 million higher. Our net income was $157 million or $3.99 per share compared with $183 million or $4.46 per share for the third quarter of 2012 and $159 million or $3.90 per share for the second quarter of 2013. Excluding the one-time tax benefits, our third quarter 2013 net income would have been $131 million or $3.32 per share and our third quarter 2012 net income would have been $148 million or $3.61 per share. Now moving to cash flows; we ended the third quarter with cash and investments of $2.5 billion, down $495 million compared with June 30, 2013. The decrease was driven by $694 million used to repurchase our common stock and $34 million of capital and IP acquisitions, partially offset by $204 million in cash flow generated from operations. During the third quarter we bought back approximately 1.74 million shares at an average price of $399 dollars per share. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion authorized by the Board for future share buybacks. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights. 
Aleks Cukic:  Thank you Marshall. During the third quarter, we sold 101 da Vinci systems; 65 in the United States, 17 into Europe and 19 in rest of world markets. As part of the 101 system sales, five standard da Vinci systems and 24 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We finished the quarter with a net 72 system additions to the installed base, bringing to 2,871 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide; 2,042 in the U.S., 455 in Europe and 374 in rest of world markets. 48 of the 101 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 100 of the 101 systems sold represented da Vinci Si or Si-e systems, which included 32 dual consoles. The 36 system sales internationally included 13 into Japan and six into France. Clinically, Q3 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 16%, which was led by the category of general surgery and paced by cholecystectomy, followed by colon rectal resections, and bariatric procedures. Our U.S. urology business was stable, while growth in the international urology business was solid. As expected, the growth rate in the U.S. for benign dVH was slightly down from Q2, which continued to place pressure on U.S. system sales. Demand for recently released new products continues to be strong. Through Q3, 2013, we sold Single-Site instruments and accessory kits to approximately 825 U.S. customers. Our Vessel Sealer product utilization trend continues to strengthen with most of the interest coming from the specialties of colorectal, advanced general and GYN surgery. The customer adoption for both da Vinci Simulator and Firefly continues to expand, with 63 customers purchasing a da Vinci Simulator and 48 customers purchasing Firefly systems, as part of their initial system purchases this quarter. In addition, we've expanded our phased rollout of both the da Vinci surgical stapling system and Single-Site hysterectomy products to several new sites. These rollouts will be expanded in a measured fashion, so we do not expect them to contribute materially in the near term. During the quarter, several 100 robotic abstracts and papers, representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within peer-reviewed journals, many focused specifically on safety and/or efficacy. Clinical conferences also produced several live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions, several with emphasis on safety and/or efficacy. I’ll take a moment to summarize a few. da Vinci hysterectomy is the single largest procedure that our customers perform. It is widely accepted that when compared to open hysterectomy the benefits provided to a patient through an MIS approach are significant. As the data supports, the rapid conversion to open hysterectomy to a minimally invasive approach continues to be led by da Vinci’s incorporation in to GYN practices. In a recent addition of the journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgery, a group out of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yale University, published a study entitled Robotic versus Abdominal Hysterectomy in Women with very large uteri. The study compared the results of 60 hysterectomies, 30 abdominal, and 30 dVHs in patients with uteri greater than 1,000 grams in weight. It is generally understood that the larger the uterus the more complex the surgery. Often necessitating an abdominal hysterectomy, and the statical scale uteri in excess of 1,000 grams are considered very large. The uteri in both cohorts study ranged in size from between 1,000 grams to just over 3,500 grams. The published results were as follows: median length of hospitalization for patients in the da Vinci cohort was one day with a range from one to two days as compared to 2.5 days with a range from two to nine days for patients in the abdominal cohorts. Estimated blood loss was 150 milliliter for the da Vinci patients versus 425 milliliters to the abdominal approach. Transfusion rates for the da Vinci cohort was 3.3% versus 13.3% with the abdominal approach. Conversion rates from da Vinci hysterectomy to an abdominal surgery was zero, as with the hernias. In their commentary, the authors pointed out the following findings. First, hysterectomy is for very large uteri are challenging procedures. Second, obesity and morbid obesity and/or previous surgeries compound the difficulty. Despite these challenges patients who are obese experience some of the greatest differential benefits for minimally invasive surgery. Finally, morbid obesity and/or previous procedures appear to not be an impediment for completing these procedures robotically. Within general surgery procedures related to the colon and rectal disease management have been among our most promising. Right and left co-intersections, sigma intersections, low anterior resection and rectopexy continue to exhibit solid growth. With the exception of right hemicolectomy and rectopexy, laparoscopic penetration has been modest with inter colon rectal surgery. Rectopexy is a procedure designed to address pelvic floor disorders or PFDs. Among other things, PFDs obstruct the patient’s ability to defecate. A recent French study compared the results of patients undergoing a laparoscopic rectopexy versus a da Vinci rectopexy. 118 patients were evaluated in the study, 44 da Vinci as compared to 74 laps. The study evaluated OR time, blood life, complications, length of hospitalization and postoperative ODS scores for obstructed defecation syndrome. Regarding total OR time which included system time, the da Vinci rectopexy took approximately 15% longer than the laparoscopic approach, but the authors noted that their times came down over their last 20 patient and were expected to continue to trend down. Blood loss was difficult to even to test during the da Vinci rectopexy and measured only 8 milliliters as compared to 42 milliliters in the lap cohorts. Complications with the da Vinci approach were 2% as compared to 11% in the lap patients. Hospitalization was reduced by a full day when using da Vinci with the authors attributed to less strenuous tissue manipulation due to improved vision and dexterity. Post op ODS scores improved for patients in both groups. However the difference in improvement for patients in the da Vinci cohort was substantial in being statically significant. In their conclusions the author stated and I quote, ‘although not a randomized comparison this study shows that ventral mesh rectopexy performed by robots was followed by better functions than lap rectopexy’. Da Vinci thoracic procedures specifically lobectomy and segmental resection has been steadily expanding over the past few years. Similar to colon and rectal surgery, the presence of minimally invasive resections has been minor as compared to open surgery. In a recent edition of the Annals of Thoracic Surgery, physician and healthcare economists from both Harvard Medical School and Cornell Medical Center collaborated on the study which compared open surgery, video assisted thoracoscopic or VAS and da Vinci resections. The study evaluated the results of over 33,000 patients who have received pulmonary resection within the eight stage study cohort. While the mix of patients was dominated by patients undergoing an open resection, the rate of growth for da Vinci surgery was significant over the three year study period. Da Vinci expanded from 0.2 of the pulmonary resection studied in the first year to 3.4 by the third year, numbering 430 in total. da Vinci procedures were performed in all stages of study with 38 being performed in community hospitals. The results in a propensity matched analysis da Vinci resections were associated with significant reductions in mortality, 0.2% versus 2.0% for open surgery. Length of stay was 5.9 days for the da Vinci patients versus 8.2 days for the open surgery. Overall complication rate was 43.8% for da Vinci versus 54.1% for open surgery. These improvements were all considered statistically significant and propensity matched analysis versus path. da Vinci lumpectomy demonstrated directional improvements in mortality and length of stay. In their summary, the authors wrote, and I quote, ‘case volume for pulmonary resections have increased significantly during the study period of thoracic surgeon, and thoracic surgeons have been able to adopt the robotic approach safely. Robotic resection appears to be an appropriate alternative to that and is associated with improved outcomes compared with open thoracotomy.’ This concludes my remarks and I will now turn the time over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2013 on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant non-cash expenses. Starting with procedures, on our last call, we projected our full year 2013 procedures to grow between 15% and 18%, above the base of approximately 450,000 procedures performed in 2012. Now, with one quarter remaining in 2013 we are refining our estimate for full year 2013 procedure growth to a range of between 16% and 17%. Moving to revenues, as has been discussed several factors are pressuring our business, making it difficult to predict system sales volumes. On our last call, we projected full year 2013 revenue to range from approximately flat to 7% growth. We now expect full year revenue growth in the lower half of that range. Turning to operating income; on our last call, we forecasted operating income to fall within a range of between 37% and 38% of net revenue. We are taking steps to scale back our expenses while not comprising our longer term expansion strategies. We continue to anticipate full year 2013 operating income to fall within the range of between 37% and 38% of revenue. Now, with regard to non-cash stock compensation expenses; we are refining our forecast to between $169 million and $172 million for the year. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $16 million and $17 million in 2013. With regard to income tax, as Marshall described, our Q3 tax rate benefited from non-recurring discrete events. For Q4 2013 we’d expect our tax rate to be approximately 28% of pre-tax income, slightly lower than previously forecast, primarily due to the geographic mix of our pre-tax income. Our share count for calculating EPS in Q3 2013 was approximately 39.3 million shares, declining 1.5 million shares in the quarter primarily due to buyback activities. In Q4 we expect our share count to decline approximately 600,000 shares further based upon the full quarter impact of our Q3 buybacks. The actual Q4 share count will depend on several factors, including the magnitude and timing of additional share buybacks if any. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho W. Peterson – JPMorgan Securities LLC:  Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess, first of all, just kind of given the change of procedures in ACA uncertainty, can you just talk about whether we should be assuming that there will be U.S. placements only if system utilization continues to increase sequentially, and how are you thinking about where system utilization could ultimately go in the next couple of years?
Calvin Darling:  So, I think in the near-term the factors that place new systems will be a few as you know. So one of them is procedure growth, one of them is access to technologies for folks who have older technology, and then last one is point-of-care where in the hospital they want to use the devices, and by far the biggest driver of those three is the procedure side. So I think utilization over time, I think people are going to look at it and look as capital owners to drive it up. It can be lumpy though. I don’t know that it has to progress linearly in terms of increases. As I said before, if you have an S platform and you want to have access to stapling that requires an Si, that they can make changes as we go through.
Tycho W. Peterson – JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then on Japan, given that you’re not likely to have reimbursement for additional procedures until 2016, could you maybe just talk about how you think about the trend there, is there going to be kind of a pause in investments beyond this initial round of placements in [indiscernible] procedures?
Calvin Darling: I think, in terms of the process for reimbursement, just so everybody knows that there will be a set of clinical data collection that’s going on out there and that will involve some hospitals getting limited approval from the government to collect that data, so we’ll see that. I think that capital sales by the broad market will be really lumpy in this period. I think it will be very hard to predict accurately what the sales profile will look like as people go through that set of clinical data and trial data. I think the commentary from the Japanese market as to their interest is strong.
Tycho W. Peterson – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then one last one for Marshall, just quickly on inventories $200 million, can you just comment on why they were that high? 
Marshall L. Mohr:  So we run on – we have lead times that we provide to our suppliers, particularly the system itself, and we obviously didn’t sell the number of systems we had anticipated until [indiscernible]. We are still taking that inventory and we don’t think there is any exposure there. We’re talking about Si, and Si is a very capable unit and capable of doing all of the surgeries we see in our near-term future.
Tycho W. Peterson – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ben C. Andrew – William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Maybe Gary talk a bit about any shift in the spending plans that Calvin referred to, and if you can give us a little bit of detail on that and over what time frame we might see that pullback?
Calvin Darling:  I think there are some things that makes sense in the next quarter or two in terms of spending, something that just scale with production volume and things like that that make a lot of sense. The other side is being careful in prioritizing the investments that we make, both in terms of prototype spending and in terms of expansion plans. We have a pretty clear set of priorities in terms of the kinds of products and the markets we want to invest in. We will not short those, but for things that are perhaps a little further out or a little bit more on the edges, then we’ll be careful about where we put our investment.
Ben C. Andrew – William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then on the clinical side, what sort of role do you have in data collection for things like complications and other clinical data sets relative to procedures like Chole where there is an opportunity to maybe transform the space further with a strong registry set or clinical study, and is that a material kind of investment for you all at this point?
Gary S. Guthart:  We do have programs where we invest in clinical research. We also invest in things like supporting registries. Also we’ll go out and provide materials and access to training and other types of resources to allow people to design trials, so we perform that way. We also fund fellowship training. We also fund residency training in different places. So we have a set of things that we do. There are institutions that will look for our health, and there are institutions who want to do things at arms length and that make sense too. So there is a combination of all of those things. I think the areas of study are diverse from very large population studies that occur in more mature procedures to smaller cohorts that are direct comparisons across one or two centers for things that are emerging, so as you think about cholecystectomy and use of Single-Site and things like Firefly Imaging, you’ll see the smaller cohort study start and those will get bigger as time goes on.
Ben C. Andrew – William Blair & Co. LLC:  Okay. And then finally for me, in terms of the pipeline for system sales in the quarter, did you see a shift in terms of how people characterize them as a delay or cancellation or any other trends there? Thank you. 
Gary S. Guthart:  Well, that’s pretty similar to last quarter. We had a number of systems that – where we got the approvals that we’re accustomed to, but then at the end, we couldn’t get the CEO or CFO and there was a hesitation there on the basis of their own concerns, uncertainties, I should say their own uncertainties around spending capital. And then of course, there’s some capital spending that’s required under the ACA for IT and so forth. And so, I think those are also capturing a greater part of the pie than we’re used to. But I don’t know that there was anything in particular I would point out.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Tao L. Levy – Wedbush Securities, Inc.:  Good afternoon. So one of the questions I had was just jumping on what Dan had just asked, is there anything that you are doing differently now on the activities or investments that you weren’t doing previously just to address some of the challenges that have cropped up over the last few quarters?
Gary S. Guthart:  No, I think the things that are – perhaps front and center is making sure that people have access to all the data that’s out there. There is an enormous amount of published literature on da Vinci. People looking for proof points can absolutely find them. I think the total publication database now is greater than 5,000 peer-review general articles on da Vinci. The number of Level 2 evidence and above, high level evidence is greater than 200. The issue was not a dearth of clinical data. There are cost studies, we’ll be posting them on links to them on the web. I mean, there is a fair amount out there. What we can do better is make sure people know it and see it and are able to digest it, so we’ve been doing that kind of activity. We’ve talked about both in Japan and in Europe. The economic analysis that needs to be done with regard to reimbursement from government payers is work that we can do and we’re having success in that work. The data is out there, the analysis can be done and so we’re making those kinds of investments, and so we’ve been scaling.
Tao L. Levy – Wedbush Securities, Inc.:  Okay. And if you can maybe comment on sort of how we should think about prices per procedure over the near-term until, I guess, systems start to recover? Is it here sort of in the 1850, 1860?
Gary S. Guthart:  I’ll let Calvin go into the modeling and the mix, but before he does just I have a comment. I think there are a couple of things going on. On the things like Single-Site and some of the benign procedures that are more cost-sensitive, we have offerings that reflect that greater cost sensitivity, and we’re happy to provide them. I think that they make sense and they fit the procedure profile.
 :
Calvin Darling:  Great. And as Marshall described on the call, the Q3, the lower revenue per procedure in Q3 specifically was driven by lower stocking orders associated with the lower system sales in Q3 as well as timing of orders. We saw hospitals reducing inventory levels in the quarter as well. Longer term, Gary was mentioning, the initial sales have an increased utilization of Vessel Sealer product, Firefly, and Stapler will help us garner a larger portion of the overall procedure revenue and serve to bolster our revenue per procedure, but then offsetting that would be diminishing impacts of stocking orders as well as procedure mix as we move deeper into benign procedures, and they become a larger portion of our overall business. It’s likely in the much longer term that this procedure mix could serve to trend the overall revenue per procedure down.
Tao L. Levy – Wedbush Securities, Inc.: So should we keep it in sort of at this 1860 level or higher?
Calvin Darling: Yes, and there are a lot of factors. I think there were some specific factors that impacted Q3 that will be pretty relevant now as you look at Q4 and next year and some of these other things are longer term.
Tao L. Levy – Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. So can I just ask last question. And procedure trends in the quarter, it seems like September might have been particularly strong for you guys on a worldwide basis. Is that the case for September year-over-year was pretty much the same? 
Gary S. Guthart:  Generally speaking, you see people coming back from vacations globally in September and so the seasonality there is such that September is stronger than the prior months and we do expect that. And then the other piece is that as our business has a greater share of benign surgeries in it over time, those tend to be more subject to seasonality. So the mix is becoming a more seasonal mix, relative to prior years and so you see that bulk of those effects kind of compound.
Tao L. Levy – Wedbush Securities, Inc.:  Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst:  Hi, guys. This is Chris in for David. Can you hear me okay?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Wonderful. Thank you for taking the questions. First question, I feel like historically the monitor has always been that that procedure growth tries just in utilization. But at this point it feels like the rate of change and the delta per procedure is a lot slower than what’s happening at the system level and that’s kind of given rise to this over capacity debate a little bit and I’m little bit curious about how your visibility and given the revised guidance, where the confidence is coming from and the revised outlook on systems growth, what has changed in the conversations with the administrators for some of the pipeline accounts that makes you feel that these guys are still on the pipeline that they won’t push out, their decision making in another six months, nine months or 12 months and maybe you could share a couple of other anecdotes of specific conversations that are happening to get, let’s have a better feel for it?
Gary S. Guthart: I’ll answer the last part first. On the system side, I think that we’ve given you a pretty broad range for the results for Q4, and Calvin even said this in his script, that reflects uncertainty as to how capital will close. And so I don’t think we exited any particular confidence on what will happen in Q4 relative to Q3. Our visibility to procedures is better. It is imperfect, but it is better than into capital purchasing decisions, particularly in the U.S. where you’re seeing some market dynamic changes. And so, we’ve given you a broad range and the reason for that broad range is it’s hard to predict how hospital administration will make some of their decisions. And right now some of the anecdotes are that hospital administrators are trying to project what their revenues will look like as the elements of the ACA get implemented and that revenue uncertainty on their side just flows through into the capital decision making uncertainty and down the line.
Unidentified Analyst:  Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you. And if I could have a follow-up here, I’m curious I noted there is a lot of work being done on the share repurchase side, but given the significant amount of cash that you guys have in the financial flexibility, is there any reason that you wouldn’t be able to up the R&D spending and really focus on addressing some of the concerns that have been out in the media and some of the major bodies recently to help, address some of the perception issues that seem to kind of keep coming up and potentially could be impacting some of the near-term system placement sales. And I feel like with the financial flexibility that more repurchases could also up that level of spending. Is that something that is on the table or has been considered or not?
Gary S. Guthart: There’s a couple of things wrapped together there, just kind of teasing them apart. With regard to the R&D spend side, we’re thoughtful and serious about our R&D priorities and the spending that goes with it. We listen really carefully to surgeons and hospital customers about what we think they need and what they think they need to make for both great surgery and surgery whose economics make sense for all the players. And so that’s the product enrollment pipeline and something that we do continuously. With regard to R&D being the solution to some of the concerns in the press, I’d encourage you to go, look at our website, look at the data. Safety profile of da Vinci is outstanding when it’s compared with the surgical alternatives that people have. So I think on that side that’s not really an R&D investment sort of issue. With regard to the use of cash and buybacks and how we think about that alternates, Marshall?
Marshall L. Mohr: We look for opportunities or discontinuities in the share price relative to the market and we did some buybacks this last quarter. It’s really a Board decision. We’ll be having those discussions on an ongoing basis with the Board and you’ll see what comes out of it.
Unidentified Analyst:  All right, great, very helpful. Thank you, guys.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Amit Hazan with Sun Trust. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  Thanks very much. Good afternoon guys. I thought may be I’d ask the first question about existing versus new customers, just regarding the U.S. system side if you can distinguish between existing customers adding capacity and then new customers. I think if we think about last quarter you seem to be saying that most of the weakness came from existing customers you choose to differ. It seems like that’s the case again here. What has been happening more on the new customer side, new customer additions and the trend line there?
Marshall L. Mohr:  All right. So just to kind of review the numbers that was mentioned there were 65 total system sales in the third quarter, 22 of them went to brand new customers, Greenfield as we call them and 43 were to existing customers. So and then let’s see, 24 involved trade-ins, so that means 19 added systems for capacity reasons in the quarter. So I think when you look at the capital environment, we talked about the issuing and I believe that the issue is described whether it’d be capacity from the decreasing growth in benign hysterectomy or the various macro issues including the ACA. I think they really impacted all of these categories.
Amit Hazan – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And then moving on to the procedure side, I want to address the question, so it’s very clear, I think you might have touched on it, but if we go through the U.S. benign hysterectomy side and think about how to model it for the next several quarters and how you saw this quarter versus last quarter. Is the impact that you are seeing there and obviously I am referring to the developments earlier in the year more than anything. Has it gotten, did it get worse this quarter or was it something that you saw as stable versus last quarter?
Gary S. Guthart: As we mentioned in the script, I think it’s following a pretty normal trajectory or trend from what we introduced in Q2 and in Q3, the Q1, Q2, Q3. So it was pretty stable and I would say, seasonally stable going into a Q3. So not much of a change between the two course.
Amit Hazan – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Great. And then just the last one from me; in terms of the impact from that same noise on other procedure categories; urology or general surgery in the U.S., do you feel at all that hospitals has applied more scrutiny to those as well because of the noise factor coming out of the first half of this year?
Gary S. Guthart: That’s an interesting question Amit. You really have to tease it apart and you have to take a look at the underlying condition, the surgical specialty itself, the alternative opportunity, the alternative treatment. In other words, when you are looking at urology and you are talking about kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer. I think it’s safe to say that, you are more immune to some of these sort of allegations that people are throwing out in the media than you are versus let’s say a benign procedure that has some benign therapies and they will high line cost and some incorrect comparators. And so I would say that the majority of that noise that we have heard and have felt is probably been in the benign GYN ide, more than anything else we have seen thus far. And I think that continues.
Amit Hazan – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Demchick – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hello, this is actually Jon Demchick in for David. Thanks for taking the questions. A quick question on I guess a few pipeline products for you guys; starting with Single-Site, had a question about having restricted capabilities, you mentioned I guess the Needle Driver that should be submitted for 510(k) approval next year, where there plans to expand the restricted capabilities across other aspects of the Single-Site platform like what are the main obstacles in doing this and what impact do you believe that this could have on broader adoption?
Aleks Cukic: I think the first question is limited to Needle Driver, can it be good taking more broadly. I think that the Needle Driver is clearly the first one to go with, with regard to Single-Site and applied to hysterectomy. I think that once you have that architecture you can start to broaden and in terms of what’s possible and the decision that would be made is to which ones coming next and why we’ll have a lot to do with which indications are the next most interesting indications for Single-Site and so that will be a process. If you follow this for a while you’d see same kind of behavior that as indications change then you bring instruments and help you optimize that set of indications.
Jonathan Demchick – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Okay. And then second also, I guess moving on to the Stapler rollout and as you continue with the rollout I was just wondering if there was a potential timeline on expanding the Stapler offering the different sizes to maybe deal in one effective bariatric surgery or other surgeries?
Gary S. Guthart:  So our first expansion will really be in terms of number of site supported with the existing Stapler. So the Stapler we have today is really targeted and optimized for colorectal procedures in terms of how big it is and what these Staple Reloads look like. And so we are going to do that and that’s where we are focused on in the near-term. Longer-term, we are working on prototypes and developing the capabilities for other types of reloads focused on other types of procedures and we will do that. That will be further out. That’s not a near-term.
Jonathan Demchick – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Okay, very helpful and just had a quick follow-up on the procedure guidance. I know you guys have given a little bit of detail here, but I just wanted to push a little further. I think it implies roughly 13% to 17% procedure growth in the fourth quarter and I was wondering if maybe you could discuss some of the assumptions across the product categories that you revealed in that guidance, and if you see any significant acceleration or deceleration across any of the large groups.
Gary S. Guthart:  Yes, I think it’s probably similar to the commentary we had last quarter and at the higher end of the range you’re talking about a continuation of the trends that we’re on from benign gynecology, general surgery and prostatectomy in the U.S. as well as international growth rates. At the lower end of the guidance it’ll just be contemplation of other factors coming to play in terms of a further decline in benign, demand for benign procedures. You’re entering a quarter that’s typically very strong seasonally and if it comes out less strong for some reason that’d be considered as well as if you see any changing trends in the cholecystectomy or prostatectomy that will be reflective in the lower end.
Jonathan Demchick – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Thank you, very helpful.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob A. Hopkins – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Can you hear me okay?
Gary S. Guthart:  Yes, we can. Yes.
Bob A. Hopkins – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Good afternoon. So I just wanted to ask you a big picture question on procedure volume growth. If I look at the model going back to the first quarter of 2012, your procedure volume growth was close to 30% and it’s kind of going down a little bit each quarter and now we’re at 16% this quarter and you’re looking at fourth quarter maybe being at the same level or a little bit lower. And so I guess just from a big picture perspective I want to get a sense of your confidence that this sort of mid-teens procedure volume growth rate is close to a bottom or is the bottom? Any thoughts there would be helpful.
Gary S. Guthart: I don’t think we are ready to give really 2014 guidance. What I’d say here in terms of what are that dynamics, what’s going on underneath these things. I think we have a large category that in the U.S. were quickly and is now growing more slowly and that was gynecology and we have a large category in the U.S. in general surgery that’s on the early part of this adoption and I think the answer to your question is going to come down to the rates of that growth on both of those sides and I think what you would expect of the company is to manage the activities that would support growth and so in the U.S. our activities are focused on supporting surgical growth and that comes down to making sure the product set makes sense for that customer, making sure that our training capability is aligned and ready to go, our sales force is capable of doing what they need to do and we have opportunity for growth or accelerate growth in U.S. markets, in Japan, where we’re making investments in Europe. So those are the underlying drivers and how it shapes out in future quarters we’ll report to you as we have greater…
Bob A. Hopkins – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  I appreciate that and I wasn’t really asking about any particular quarter, just asking about all the different trends that are impacting growth and where we stand now and just trying to kind of gauge your confidence on. At this point there are more positives to negatives and again just trying to gauge confidence as to sort of where we are in the cycle right now and your confidence that this is obviously critically important metric to your company that we have your best sense as to where that’s going to fall out.
Gary S. Guthart: One of the challenges, Bob has always been trying to read the assumptions that we’ve given you and hold them for long periods of time. In other words, we’re almost – the way the question is framed, it’s almost asking us to sort of freeze the assumption as the final assumptions and not take into consideration things like potential expansion of, let’s say Single-Site hysterectomy and/or international market growth where we’re putting in a lot of resources and training centers and so on and so forth. So I would say from a confidence standpoint, we believe there are a lot of future drivers and present drivers in the business and it becomes as it always does, an execution story, both downstream and upstream execution of what we think are great opportunities and that’s what you should judge us on and that’s where our focus is.
Calvin Darling: Bob, time for one more follow-up question.
Bob A. Hopkins – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Thanks. Just one real quick one on utilization, that’s also a challenging part of the model going forward. How do you think that we should be thinking about utilization sort of per system going forward? I assume that that needs to continue to climb up, but just any general thoughts on kind of utilization per installed base as we look forward.
Gary S. Guthart:  Yes, I mean if you look at just the trends right, coming up prior to 2013, we’ve seen gradual increases in utilization per system as measured by procedures done in a quarter as a numerator and a denominator of the systems installed at the beginning of the quarter. We’ve seen that gradually increasing. Now you get to 2013 with the moderating growth in benign gynecology. Now you’re seeing moderate decreases in each of the first three quarters of this year. Yeah, ultimately I think we’d still say procedures are really what drive this business here. There are other factors that impact the timing of system sales, which we’ve been through, but again procedures and the greater growth there is going to be the key and I think the ultimate utilization is going to depend on a lot of factors; hospitals gaining efficiency, Affordable Care Act, procedure mix. So the ultimate direction, it’s hard to really say.
Bob A. Hopkins – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Thanks very much.
Gary S. Guthart:  That was the last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. The following is a part of an interview published by Medscape with Dr. Joseph Colella, Director of Robotic Surgery at Magee Women’s Hospital, part of UPMC. When he was asked about the future of robotic assisted surgery, the answer is follows, “As a potential patient stop for a moment and put on the commonsense hat. Your surgeon tells you that he can see 100% better in three dimensions that he can sew better and in the future, he will be able to do every procedure through one incision. You can imagine that the sky is the limit in employing robotic surgery. It’s an enabling technology. I firmly believe that we are finding new and beneficial applications, almost on a monthly basis. For instance, nobody ever thought you would be able to resect tumors of larynx without taking half of the face apart to get to them. With the robot in the right hands, you can do those operations in an hour and the patient goes home the next day.” This concludes our today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to next three months.
Operator:  Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. As we previously announced, our second quarter has been a challenging one. Capital sales fell 5% from the prior year with the shortfall concentrated in the United States. We attribute this primarily to slower than expected da Vinci benign gynecology procedure growth in the United States. Taken globally, overall procedure performance in the quarter was solid rising 18% over prior year in the face of several headwinds. Summarizing procedures in the United States strong general surgery growth continued centered within single site cholecystectomy and colon and rectal resections. In gynecology, DVH for malignant conditions was solid, while DVH growth for benign indications grew more slowly than expected. Urologic procedures continued to be stable. In Europe, procedures grew sequentially over Q1, led by urology and early growth in malignant dVH. Growth was strongest in the U.K. and Nordic countries, moderate in the core countries and weakest in the south. Procedure growth in Asia was strong off of a small base, led by growth in urology and general surgery with particular strength in Japan, Taiwan and China. Turning to systems, we sold 143 systems, 7 fewer than Q2 of 2012, with sales of new systems in the United States totaling 90, down from 124 a year ago. We believe the slowing of our growth in benign gynecologic procedures in the United States to be a significant contributor to weaker than expected system sales. There appear to be a couple of underlying causes for slower than expected U.S. benign dVH growth. Overall admissions for benign gynecology appear to be under pressure in the first half of 2013, since we are a significant share of hysterectomy, our growth rate in dVH is sensitive to these admissions. Second, our MCS notification and negative press occurred in the quarter and may have pressured growth in utilization, although estimating their impact on procedure volume is difficult. Given that the average da Vinci system is used for hundreds of procedures per year, a change in da Vinci patient admissions can free capacity on existing systems and pressure new system sales. This appears to be the case this quarter. Looking towards the second half of the year, we see increasing pressure on U.S. system sales. Globally, our business in Asia has continued to build. In Japan, system sales were strong in the quarter, showing continued interest in da Vinci surgery. Our work with surgical societies is ongoing and there are efforts to obtain national reimbursement for procedures beyond prostatectomy. Currently, it appears unlikely that additional procedures will receive national reimbursement in April 2014 insurance revision, given recent guidance from MHLW. As we said in the past, we continue to expect Japan system sales to be highly variable from quarter-to-quarter. We are investing in building our team in Japan with a view towards long-term performance. Capital sales in Europe have grown over the past few quarters in a difficult environment. As we have said on prior calls, sales force changes in Europe have made a positive difference. We are gathering European clinical and reimbursement data and expect these investments to increase in the future. Given macroeconomic stresses in Europe and government processes, we expect reimbursement efforts to be a long-term endeavor. During the quarter, FDA conducted an on-site audit of ISI and issued a set of four observations in Form 483, previously reported in June. Yesterday, we received a warning letter from FDA as a follow-on for these audit inspection findings asking for additional steps to resolve two of the observation. These concerns are addressable and we are in the process of doing so. Turning to operating performance for the second quarter, procedures grew approximately 18% over the second quarter of 2012. We sold 143 da Vinci surgical systems, down from 150 during the second quarter of last year. Total revenue was $579 million, up 8% over last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $265 million, up 18% over Q2 2012. Total recurring revenue grew to $363 million, up 18% from prior year and comprising 63% of total revenue. Net income was $159 million, up 3% over last year and we generated an operating profit of $257 million before non-cash stock option expense, down 1% from the second quarter of last year and representing 45% of Q2 revenue. We ended the quarter with $3.270 billion in cash and investments, down $89 million from last quarter. In the quarter, we generated $189 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 119% of our reported GAAP net income. And, finally, we repurchased $270 million of our stock. Before turning the time over to Marshall, it is worth taking a step back and looking at a longer-term view of da Vinci technology in surgery. We remain deeply positive on the value da Vinci can bring to surgery now and in the future. The benefit da Vinci brings as an alternative to open surgery has been demonstrated in hundreds of peer-reviewed clinical papers and is widely accepted by our customers. Though some da Vinci procedures mature in the United States, we are increasingly exposed to volatility in patient admissions for our core procedures and the consequent lumpiness in capital sales. Viewed over the long-term, da Vinci surgery contributes to a trend in surgery for consolidation of procedures into fewer surgeons with higher volume. We believe this consolidation is good for patients, surgeons, hospitals and Intuitive. We are still early in the global adoption of da Vinci enabled minimally invasive surgery as applied to complex conditions. In recent quarters, we have seen building interest in the use of da Vinci in general surgery, stand-in procedures from the pelvis to the upper gastrointestinal intestinal tract. As we expand our offerings in technologies like vessel sealing, stapling and Firefly, we are seeing increased utilization and efficiency in general surgery procedures that are otherwise very difficult to perform. Taking a recent example, EndoWrist vessel sealers are now installed in roughly half of our U.S. customers. These technologies also open the door to additional clinical applications such as thoracic surgery where long-term additions to stapling can bring benefits to procedures that are often difficult to perform through small incisions. Looking at single incision surgery, single site cholecystectomy chips have been purchased by approximately half of our U.S. customers 18 months after launch. This procedure is currently growing faster than any prior da Vinci procedure. Early adopting clinical sites have been progressing in refined procedure choreography with single site hysterectomy as well. Furthermore we are investing in expanding single site technology and expect to bring to market additional single site instruments as well as integration with other da Vinci technologies including Firefly and simulation. As our product suite develops further, we anticipate pursuing additional clinical indications for single site. Considering trends in healthcare policy around the globe, a long-term intention to move away from fee-for-service and towards single payment per treatment event can advantage those approaches with fewer complications and fewer readmissions. Also the trend towards public transparency of individual surgeon and hospital outcomes has the potential to shift patient dynamics toward those programs, showing the best outcomes. Again while we cannot predict future implementations of policy, we believe their direction made set up well for da Vinci surgeons, their patients and hospital programs. In summary, we continue to see a long-term opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and are focused on the following. Extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery using da Vinci in gynecology and urology worldwide, building da Vinci capability and supporting its use in general surgery, disciplined execution in our stapling and single site product launches and finally, continuing to invest in our capabilities in international markets, particularly Europe and Japan. I will now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our second quarter revenue was $579 million, up 8% compared with $537 million for the second quarter of 2012 and down 5% from last quarter. Second quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Second quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $265 million, up 18% compared with $224 million in the second quarter of 2012 and up 1% compared with the first quarter of 2013. The year-over-year increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by procedure growth of 18%. Sales of new products including single site, vessel sealer and Firefly partially offset by lower instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with lower second quarter system sales. The 18% increase in da Vinci procedures for the quarter reflected strength in general surgery procedures and slower growth in benign gynecologic procedures. As Gary indicated, the slowdown in benign gynecologic growth reflects a number of factors including, but not limited to, weaker hospital admissions for benign da Vinci procedures. Our second quarter 2013 U.S. dVP procedures were approximately 5% lower than the second quarter of 2012 and 2% lower than the first quarter of 2013. The sequential increase in instrument and accessory revenue compared with last quarter was driven by higher procedure volume partially offset by lower instrument and accessory stocking orders. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $2,020 per procedure, which was roughly equal to the second quarter of 2012 and lower than the approximately $2,110 last quarter. The decrease compared to the first quarter reflected lower stocking orders and the timing of orders. Second quarter 2013 systems revenue of $216 million decreased 6% compared with $229 million for the second quarter of 2012 and decreased 16% compared with $256 million last quarter. Overall, we sold 143 systems in the second quarter of 2013, compared with 150 systems in the second quarter of last year and 164 systems last quarter. We sold 90 systems into the U.S. market in the second quarter of 2013, compared with 124 systems last year and 115 systems last quarter. The lower second quarter 2013, U.S. system sales reflected among other things, the impacts of moderating growth U.S. benign gynecologic procedures and increased economic pressure on hospitals. During the second quarter of 2013, we sold 53 systems into international markets, including 21 into Europe and 20 into Japan, compared with 26 in international markets in the second quarter 2012, which included 13 the Europe and 7 into Japan and 49 systems in international markets in the first quarter of 2013, which included 16 into Europe and 25 into Japan. Our second quarter average sales price per system was $1.5 million, compared with 1.53 million realized in the second quarter of 2012 and the 1.55 million realized last quarter. ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators and Firefly when configured with the system and exclude upgrades. Our second quarter 2013 ASPs were lower than the first quarter due to a lower proportion of dual console configuration and slightly higher proportion of sales involving trade-in. 43 of our second quarter 2013 system sales involved trade-in, comprised of 39 da Vinci Ss and four standard models. 35 of our second quarter 2012 sales involved trade-ins and 39 of our first quarter 2013 sales involved trade-in. Service revenue increased to $98 million, up 18%, compared with $83 million last year and up 4% compared with $94 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system installed base. International revenue results were as follows. Second quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $158 million, up 56% compared with revenue of $101 million in the second quarter last year and up 3% compared with $153 million last quarter. Our higher year-over-year international revenue growth was driven primarily by higher da Vinci system sales into the Japanese and European markets. Our higher sequential international revenue was driven by higher European system sales, partially offset by lower system sales into Japan. Second quarter 2013, international procedure volume was approximately 23% higher than the second quarter of 2012 and 6% higher than the first quarter of this year. Moving on to remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the second quarter 2013 was 70%, compared with 72% for the second quarter 2012 and 71% for the first quarter 2013. Our lower margin percentage compared to the second quarter of last year resulted primarily from the impact of the medical device excise tax enacted beginning in 2013 and product. Our lower gross margin percentage compared to last quarter was driven primarily by cost associated with the MTS recall, lower system ASPs and product mix. Second quarter 2013 operating expenses of $187 million were up 16%, compared with the second quarter 2012 and up 2% compared with the first quarter this year. Our higher year-over-year operating expense increase was driven by headcount additions. Our increase compared to last quarter was driven by headcount additions and higher legal costs offset by lower incentive compensation. Second quarter 2013 operating income was $219 million, or 38% of sales compared with $225 million or 42% of sales last year and $251 million or 41% of sales last quarter. Second quarter 2013 operating income included $39 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $33 million last year and $38 million last quarter. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 28.6%, compared with 32.4% for the second quarter 2012 and 26.1% last quarter. Our second quarter rate was a bit lower than the midpoint of our 28% to 30% guidance range, primarily reflecting a higher proportion of international pre-tax income. Our net income was $159 million or $3.90 per share, compared with $155 million or $3.75 per share last year and $189 million or $4.56 per share last quarter. Now, moving to cash flow. We ended the second quarter with cash and investments of $3 billion, down $89 million compared with March 31, 2013. The decrease was driven by $270 million used to repurchase our common stock and $25 million of capital and IP acquisition, partially offset by $189 million in cash flow generated from operation. During the second quarter, we bought back approximately 546,000 shares at an average price of $493 per share. We ended the quarter with approximately 900 million authorized by the board for share buyback. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the second quarter, we sold 143 da Vinci systems. 90 in the United States, 21 into Europe and 32 in to the rest of world markets. As part of the 143 system sales, four standard da Vinci systems and 39 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We finished the quarter with a net 89 system additions to the installed base, bringing to 2,799 accumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide. 2,001 in the United States, 443 in Europe and 355 in rest of world markets. 61 of the 143 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 140 of the 143 systems sold represented da Vinci Si or S-e systems which included 27 dual console systems. The 53 system sales internationally included 20 in Japan, four into Russia and three into the countries of France, Germany, the U.K., And Australia and Taiwan. Clinically, Q2 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 18%, led by the category of general surgery paced by cholecystectomy, followed by colon and rectal resections. Other general surgery procedures showing strong growth included gastric, pancreatic and achalasia procedures. Overall urology growth was solid and included strong OUS dVP growth with continued stability in U.S. dVP. As Gary stated, our benign GYN procedure growth moderated for the second quarter in a row, which had an adverse effect on our U.S. system sales. We believe that our U.S. procedure opportunity within benign GYN remained solid though we do recognize that the procedures remaining on the back half of the adoption curve will be more difficult to consolidate. The slower adoption within the benign GYN segment will most likely lead to continued lumpiness in U.S. system placements. Recently released new products continue to perform well. Through Q2, we sold single site instrument and accessory kits to approximately 740 U.S. customers. Our vessel sealer product sales were strong, with most of the interest coming from the specialties of colorectal, advanced general and GYN surgery. The customer adoption for both da Vinci simulator and Firefly continues to expand with 96 customers purchasing a da Vinci simulator and 76 customers purchasing Firefly systems as part of their initial system purchase this quarter. In addition, we have expanded our phased rollout of both the da Vinci surgical stapling system and single site hysterectomy products to several new sites. These rollouts will be expanded in a measured fashion, so we do not expect them to contribute materially to 2013 revenue. During the quarter, several hundred robotic abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer-reviewed journals while quarterly clinical conferences produced several live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. So, I will take a few moments to summarize a couple that provide interesting perspectives within the area of general surgery. The rate of surgical conversions from a laparoscopic procedure to an open surgery is most often related to the complexity of the procedure. We describe this relationship within our urologic and gynecologic procedure businesses and believe it applies to all surgical specialties in which we participate. This past quarter, several peer-reviewed general surgery studies described da Vinci surgery within this very context. A colorectal study colorectal study published in the Journal Surgical Endoscopy, compared 84 consecutive minimally invasive low anterior resection, 47 incorporating da Vinci and 37 employing traditional laparoscopy technique. The study emanated out of the division of colorectal surgery at Yonsei University Hospital completed in 2010, had a median follow-up of 31 and a half months. Within their review, the authors describe overall safety and efficacy as similar within the two cohorts. However, the differences in the conversion rate from MIS to open and overall hospital stay were considered significant. Within the laparoscopic cohort 16.2% of the patients had required conversions to open surgical technique as compared to 2.1% within the da Vinci cohort. Though both techniques are minimally invasive, the requisite hospitalization for patients undergoing a da Vinci colorectal resection was reduced by two days. The authors stated, and I quote, "We compared the long and short-term results for patients who underwent robotic and laparoscopic low anterior resection and coloanal anastomosis. Robotic coloanal anastomosis had short and long-term outcomes comparable with those of laparoscopy. In particular, we found that patients in the robotic group demonstrated significantly lower rate of conversion to open surgery and had shorter hospital stay than the patients in the laparoscopic group. A lower rate of conversion to open surgery has a very important impact clinically, because the conversions often are associated with high complication rate and a poor prognosis." In the Annals of Surgery, a study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh entitled robotic assisted, minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy is superior to laparoscopic technique compared to results of the department's first 30 da Vinci distal pancreatectomies to a historical cohort comprised of their last 94 laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies. The patients in the study demonstrated equivalent age, sex, race, ASA scores and tumor size. Within their comments, the authors noted, to their surprise, that the operating time between the two cohorts showed a substantial reduction of over 75 minutes in favor of the da Vinci technique. In addition, they reported that the rate of conversion to open surgery was 16% for the laparoscopic patient versus zero among the da Vinci patients, this despite a greater probability for malignancy within the da Vinci group. Also noteworthy was more pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas were approached robotically. 43% than laparoscopically at 15%. Oncologic outcomes in these cases were superior for the robotic-assisted group with higher rates of margin negative resection and improved lymph node yield for both, benign and malignant lesions. In their summary, the authors wrote and I quote "Robotic distal Pancreatectomies were equivalent to lap distal Pancreatectomies in nearly all measures of outcomes and safety, but significantly reduced the risk of conversion to open resection despite a statistically greater probability of malignancy in the robotic cohort. We concluded that robotic assistance may broaden indications for minimally invasive pancreatectomy". This concludes my remarks and I will now pass the time over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2013 on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant non-cash expenses starting with procedures. On our last call, we projected full year 2013 procedures to grow towards the lower end of a range of between 20% and 23% from the base of approximately 450,000 procedures performed in 2012. Now, based upon moderating growth rates for U.S. benign gynecologic procedures, we are adjusting our projection for full year 2013 procedure growth to a range of between 15% and 18%. Moving to revenues. As has been discussed earlier on this call, capital sales of da Vinci systems are highly sensitive to changes in procedure growth patterns. Moderating procedure growth has led to increased capacity in our installed base. Given this sensitivity, it is challenging for us to forecast the number of systems we expect to sell in the second half of this year, so we have widened our guidance range. Given the significant portion of our revenue that is derived from system sales, we now expect total 2013 revenue to range from approximately flat to 7% growth compared to full year 2012. Turning to operating income. On our last call, we forecast operating income to fall within a range of between 38% and 39% of net revenue. At this point, given our reduced revenue expectations, we are taking steps to scale back expenses. We do not intend to make short-term spending cuts in areas that would compromise our longer-term expansion strategies. As a result, we now anticipate full year 2013 operating income to fall within a range of between 37% and 38% of revenue. Now with regard to non-cash stock compensation expenses. On our last call, we forecast 2013 total stock compensation to total between $184 million and $192 million for the year. Based upon our current stock price, we are reducing our forecast to a range of between $164 million and $172 million for the year. Timing of recognition should follow a quarterly pattern similar to 2012. We expect other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $17 million and $19 million in 2013. With regard to income tax, our Q2 tax rate was 28.6% of pretax income. Our rate for the remainder of the year will likely be close to that level. Our share count for calculating EPS in Q2 2013 was approximately 40.8 million shares. Directionally, in Q3, our share count will likely modestly decline from the Q2 level. The actual share count will depend on several factors including the magnitude and timing of share buybacks. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair
Ben Andrew - William Blair: I wanted to follow up on a couple of points, I guess, to start. Gary, you talked about the fact that system growth would likely be lumpy over the course of the coming quarters. Can you give us some sense of what your inputs have been lately from the field and from customers relative to how lumpy and what that mix between new customers and existing customers is likely look like going forward?
Gary Guthart: I think the commentary is pretty much as we have outlined it for you. We see really an issue in the U.S., so the existing customers looking at capacity. We don’t see existing customers walking away from the technology or the opportunity but more a question of timing for them. So it feels more like delay than otherwise. As we have said in the past, I think that capital sales are really driven by three underlying drivers. One of them is additional capacity and existing customers. One of them is technologies or new features that they would like to get. The third are customers that are not yet da Vinci owners who are interested in engaging. We have had good success with the new technologies that we are bringing out. So we see that is as proceeding. I think the growth rate on benign gynecologic procedures has come in the second quarter grew, but grew at a slower rate than we were expecting. There is a multiplier effect there on capacity. So the capacity constraints in existing accounts will take some quarters to work out.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Gary, can you may be give us comments or perhaps, Aleks, on this about any correlation between the volume of benign GYN cases and physician visits because we heard some noise back and forth about flattish or even sometimes declining patient volumes overall. Does that appear to be part of it as may this historically it was being utilized less frequently and other things like that around the procedure growth is obviously a big change in hysterectomy growth. Has this happened to you in the last couple of quarters?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I think in terms of total in-patient admissions as a whole, and then people coming and seeking, women coming and seeking hysterectomy. As you know in-patient admission data broadly lags for a while, so we get out that by more or less the same way you do by talk to our customers, by looking at survey data and trying to look at other analysis. It's clear that in the first quarter total in-patient admissions were lower than people had expected them and in some cases and some institutions negative as a total. In Q2, we are hearing mixed feedback on total. For hysterectomy as a whole, our customers are seeing a pressure both, in Q1 and in Q2. Quantifying that in Q2 is tough just because the data likes and so qualitatively we have seen some pressure there and there are some things that are just hard for us to handicap in terms of intuitive specific events and their impact on benign test. Thing like the MCS notification are just harder for us to quantify what that impact was.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Sure. Then Calvin, I guess, very briefly on the procedure guidance the 15% to 18%, does that assume that benign hysterectomy rose sequentially in the back half versus the first half. I know you've got some year-over-year comparisons there as well. So, I mean, maybe well a different versus year-on-year.
Calvin Darling: Yes. I think when you look at the overall guidance and the revised range, we are talking about general surgery performing well and in line with our earlier guidance. And similarly on urology side and international, so I think the change overall really is very much attributable to the benign gynecologic procedures in the U.S. And, so I think, we are still talking about growth. It's a moderating growth pattern and the trajectory for the quarters ought to follow a similar pattern to what we've seen historically.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities: On the warning letter that you received, it seems rather fast for the FDA to come in June and then few weeks later give you guys a warning letter. Can you maybe go into little more details as to what they are looking for?
Calvin Darling: The consent of the letter is really a reflection of the concept that was in 43 Form that was issued in June. There were four observations. There are two mentions in warning letter become public, but two mentions of things that like additional insight into. One of them had to do with the procedure by which recall is classified and their participation in that classification that was kind of the first bullet in that. And the other bullet, they want additional information on has to do with user input and design elements having to do a particular product. I think those are addressable. We are working on addressing them. I think we can address them quickly and move on.
Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities: Did the letter mention anything about having to come back and revisit the facility or audits?
Calvin Darling: There is a mention that they will come back and audit specifically around recall classifications.
Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities: And, you also mentioned about Japan and not expecting and any additional reimbursed procedures, so in the next cycle but the MHLW kind of mention to you guys about that?
Calvin Darling: They are. MHLW is working on guidance documentation for reimbursement, but more broadly than us for new technologies that's outline the data requirements for what that like to see in Japan, Japan specific data. For prostatectomy, we are able to use global data and had a good interaction with MHLW given current guidance, again, I think it is a class of products more broad than us. They are looking for additional data collection in Japan specifically. That's going to vary by procedure. The data requirements appear to vary by procedure having to do with maturity of clinical data and so it's not all locked down yet. We are continuing to work with surgical societies who in turn work with MHLW but given the visibility we have on it now, it looks like there will be partial reimbursement followed by national reimbursement on a timeline that has to be decided based on their daily requirements. As we get additional insight and understand it deeper, we will share that with you.
Tao Levy - Wedbush Securities: Okay, lastly sort of a decadence on system sales throughout the rest of the year. Is the pressure that we should model that primarily just U.S. based. Is that right way to think about it or do you see anything else in sort of Europe, rest of the world, Japan as well?
Gary Guthart: I will start with a broad answer and let Marshall color it is as well. In the U.S., I think the dynamics that we saw in the second quarter may persist for the back half of the year. In terms of OUS, we are pleased with the progress we are making in Europe but as you know Europe can be really lumpy. Likewise in Japan. I think that that Japan has had some boluses of pent-up demand and what that looks like in future quarters is likely to not be stable. I don’t think I would use past couple quarters to predict the future next quarters. Marshall?
Marshall Mohr: Specifically in Japan, we introduced type in the beginning of the year. I think that helped drive increased system sales and we don’t see that level continuing and as Gary said, Europe will be lumpy, particularly Q3 is a vacation period for them, and so historically we have seen lower sales in Europe in Q3.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: Thank you for taking the question. Gary, both in your and Aleks' prepared remarks you referenced the volume of data that continue to come out regarding the da Vinci system but as you think about some of the headlines out there that have materialized in the past six and half months and the rising concerns, potentially from payers as it relates to hysterectomy. To what extent have you started to rethink the need or potential need for a large-scale randomized clinical trial to really definitively put a line in the sand on the value proposition of da Vinci, that a multicenter multi-hundred patient clinical trial, even if it is sponsored by the company?
Gary Guthart: That’s a good question. Going forward, I think clearly, large-scale studies are, or multi-institutional, multi-surgeons are powerful and are important. Speaking to the headlines a little bit, I think that headlines often confound the differences between complex procedures and simples ones and the use of da Vinci as an alternative to open versus the da Vinci as an alternative to laparoscopy. I think there is a lot of very strong data for the use of da Vinci as an alternative to open surgery. That said, going back to your comment, we are investing in large-scale studies. They are not always prospective randomized trials. Sometimes, they are registries. Sometimes they are occupational trials. Sometimes they are prospective randomized. There is a lot on the institutions that are doing them and the nature of the data they already have and the data they are collecting. But we are believers in indicated tests. We think that matters and over time, we will see more of that come out, both in hysterectomy and in other procedures.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: And maybe just on the systems side, surely, I can appreciate that the slowing utilization or slowing procedure volumes will impact the rate at which you sell systems. But it seems like a pretty fast drop-off in system presence relative to what is, at least it looks to be in the quarter, a pretty modest slowing in procedure volumes. So am I reading that wrong if I say that there is already a lot of capacity out there as systems and a small tweak on the volume side is going to make a big impact on procedures or is it something that procedure worsen throughout the quarter so forward view is a little bit more cautious? Am I looking at that wrong?
Gary Guthart: I will separate it into two things. I think I am going to take the second part first. The idea of, did we see a softening at the back end of the quarter in terms of procedures and that driving additional conservativism or the back half the year. We did not see a strong fall off in procedures through the quarter. It wasn’t that. We got to the end and procedures were really ramping down or anything like that in terms of rates. In terms of sensitivity, we came out of a strong fourth quarter of '12 both in procedures and in systems saw some mixed dynamics in Q1 across the industry us included. In terms of procedure volumes in-patient admissions and that's the benign hysterectomy for da Vinci. Growth rate really struggled to gain traction again in Q2 and I think that that has, added up to the sensitivity you are seeing in systems. I do think because systems are used for hundreds of procedures a year and we are doing a fair number of procedures in the U.S. that are benign hysterectomy procedures. There's the sensitivity that gets you to the capital number.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe lastly, the guide, the flattest of 7% total revenue guidance for the year just roughly looking and it seems that you've taken a pretty conservative approach with respect to systems and almost it's like you are extrapolating second quarter trend in and close to flat running them through the balance of the year, so is that guidance meant to reflect the degree of uncertainty that might exist in both, the capital markets as well as the timing of any more correlation to slowing procedure volumes and flowing and that that this is a view based on what you know today and then sort of taking that forward that sort of give you some room on the overall performance of the business.
Calvin Darling: Yes. David, our wider range in the revenue guidance does reflect the slower growth in da Vinci procedures and really the uncertainty and the trend in dVH. Our underlying assumptions, we have seen roughly flat system utilization the back half of the year with a reduced growth assumption on procedures and the rest basically falls through. Again as we discussed, the capital sales are highly sensitive to changes the procedure growth trends in our guidance for materially fewer system sales in the second half of 2013 that the first couple other points on guidance while we are on the topic and we talk a lot about system ASPs. It's probably likely the second half system ASPs maybe modestly lower than the first half based on a higher proportion of the sales that may involved trade-ins with the low volumes. Then secondly the second half. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure will probably also directionally be a bit lower than we saw the first half just based upon fewer stocking orders associated with the lower system sales.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Amit Hazan - SunTrust: Thanks, guys. Just one question dVH side. One of the reasons you noted for weakness was the move of hysterectomy from the in-in patient to outpatient setting, but the data kind of shows pretty clearly kind of this has been an ongoing thing for years now, maybe about 5% or so a year consistently for a long time. So, I am wondering what has intuitive change now, particularly this quarter. (Inaudible) noted that kind of beyond that, already existing long-term trend.
Calvin Darling: Yes. I think there are a couple of underlying dynamics in the dVH space, and actually pulling them apart and putting numbers on them is very, very tough. One of them has been we have seen over recent quarters a pressure by payers on use of hysterectomy as a whole, and we are hearing that back through our surgeon channels. What it takes to authorized and hysterectomy and kind of conservative medical management before that we are also seeing their policies towards driving them into the regulatory setting versus in-patient settings. After that the deductible dynamics and another macroeconomic trends and then some. Intuitive-specific dynamics around negative press and and/or MCS notification and you've guys set of things that the contributors sorting exactly which is which in real-time is a very tough. It really is going to be survey data retrospective analysis to figure out which of those is dominant. Some of them are increasing trends. Some of them seem to be episodic trends.
Amit Hazan - SunTrust: Okay. Then back to the system side, I want to just kind of maybe touch on the deferral versus cancellation? Again, I think you guys were using the word deferral in your preannouncement, press release. Can you talk a little bit about the systems that maybe you are close to closing and didn’t, that were deferred because of the lower trajectory as expected growth of procedures, and whether you are hearing in large part that was a deferral and not necessarily a cancellation and then move away from that technology and are we have talking virtually pretty much all of the units that sell into that bucket or where there is some that you feel where cancellation, not really moving away from your technology?
Gary Guthart: So the pipeline entering the quarter, as we commented three months ago was strong and that, as you know, capital sales tend to be back-ended. So it wasn’t until the end of the quarter that thing started to drop off. The reasons that we were given for systems falling off included things like an inability to get financing, just additional levels of approval required within hospital systems. So it just felt like a harder environment, from an economic perspective. It did feel like a number of them were pushed off. Now, we see them being pushed off. Do they ultimately get done is really hard to predict. We don’t know as someone has intent to buy because of hospital dynamics or concerns about the economy whether they will still have those concerns for a quarter or two out or whether those will go away and capacity will catch such that they buy. So its really hard for us to predict which ones will come back and which ones will not. But the initial commentary that you we are getting from hospitals was they are pushing them up.
Amit Hazan - SunTrust: Okay, and just one final one for me on utilization. I think you mentioned you are assuming flat utilization in the back half. I am just wondering as we start to think about general surgery and especially cholecystectomy in there being a shorter procedure whether we should be considering utilization per system starting to go up a little bit more than it has been in trend?
Gary Guthart: It’s a very good point. As chole's and other simple procedures get done, they are faster. They also tend to be more schedulable. Benign disease patient can schedule into a slot often better or easier than in a case of a malignant disease. So as that becomes material and bigger, I think that utilization may well go up. I think ultimately that’s a good thing for hospitals and a good thing for us but it can create some uncertainty in terms of predicting where utilization ought to settle. Now, things like, just to add a point, colorectal procedures are also growing, our complex longer general surgery procedures and cancer procedures. So, you have both of those dynamics going on at once and so the mix change is the thing you have to predict to get to utilization and that’s how Calvin at his guidance on.
Calvin Darling: Yes, and I think as the trends have been, over the last few years, gradual growth. Low mid-single digit percentage growth in utilization per system. Now they are almost 2,800 systems out there now and they are all at the various stages of adoption. So my point is it’s a large sample size and that metric historically has moved very gradually in direction.
Gary Guthart: And just speaking for the long-term, looking out multiple quarters, our utilization is ultimately great for hospitals. They get a good return on their investment and it is great for the company. So over time if it heads that way then we will adjust.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis - Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
John Demchak - Morgan Stanley: Hello, this is actually John Demchak in for David. Thanks for taking the question. So you gave some numbers on the magnitude of growth rate for dVP in the quarter, but I didn’t really hear anything that’s specific towards dVH? So I was wondering if you could give us maybe additional color on the magnitude for malignant or benign? If not, if you could also maybe discuss how you are thinking about some of those pressures? If they are maybe more temporary or if you think they are more permanent and structural and maybe the total addressable market that you have previously discussed maybe needs to come down a bit?
Gary Guthart: Yes, I don’t think we are going to give specific percentage growth rates in the hysterectomy here but I think we are out of certain trajectory through 2012 and there was a noticeable change in the growth rate in Q1 that was continued out into Q2 and when we look at our guidance we are projecting out our growth rate at that lower trend.
Marshall Mohr: Yes, and as far as the addressable market, again what we have created is really a construct for the way we think about the procedures that we can access. We talk about, in the case of dVH, it started with that complex beginning with malignant endometrial cervical cancers, et cetera. Then into the complex benign and we ultimately are going after what is open surgery. There may be some intersection between laparoscopic and so on, but really the primary target. We still stand by that. We believe that that is our target market, but what we have really realized is that as you get to the back half of these adoption curves, accessing those procedures with the same sort of approach as you did on the front half of it is difficult. In other words, they don't consolidate same way at same pace. So, we feel strongly about the opportunity still being there and fruitful, but the timing of it in the backend is going to be difficult to predict and therein lies the challenge that you saw in the first couple of quarters and the effect it had on the systems.
John Demchak - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. Very helpful. Kind of speaking more on the dVH side also. Will the dVH outlook maybe impacts any hiring that's going on the procedure side for general surgery or maybe effect of balance or disrupts that you have gain access in both areas.
Calvin Darling: As we think about opportunity, we look at it in terms of procedure growth regionally, so we look at U.S. and various regions and see what opportunity and penetration levels look like and they are non-uniform. It's not that the whole country is all at the same level of adoption. And as adoption is deep in some areas for gynecology that resource is to pursue general surgery and other things, so that's really how we are directing on our sales force.
John Demchak - Morgan Stanley: Yes. Then just one quick follow-up on the buyback authorization for March, I was wondering if you could give any additional color on your thoughts towards the capital deployment and maybe timing?
Calvin Darling: It will be consistent with what we said in the past and we will look for the right opportunities to buy back shares, so looking this continuities and expect stock price from the market and we have authorized and we intend to use it appropriately.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Thanks for taking the question. I guess first one just on kind of a general roadmap here for general surgery. Can you talk a little bit about how sustainable do you think the demand you are seeing in chole is right now? Are you seeing centers trial and then other ramp up or what's the dynamic right there and then can you also talk on bariatric and maybe some of these other opportunities in general surgery beyond chole and LAR?
Calvin Darling: Okay. On single site cholecystectomy, we have seen a good stick rate and in some ways better stick rate than past procedures in terms of early experiences and we have seen great growth out of some centers. One of the exciting things about single site cholecystectomy is that, number one, it's a procedure where surgeons can see high volume. And so when they move, they get a lot of experience quickly. So, the early part of that experience has been good. Having said that, there were absolutely some surgeons and there were absolutely some institutions who will not participate. There are some folks who believe in the value proposition and see the benefits it's bringing and bringing to them and it’s patients. Some centers have great growth in their admissions, but there are some who are on the sidelines and may stay on the side line, so I think it's going to split the field for some time. How far it penetrates and how long, I think that remains to be seen. I think, there is a segment of patients that value it. I think there is a segment of surgeons who value it and who are gaining experience rapidly, but trying to call where the end is something we can do.
Gary Guthart: With respect to the broader category that you outlined, I think there's really two things to think about or two ways to think about it. One is the absolute contribution of the individual procedure. So, for example, on a distal pancreatectomy or on a liver procedures, or spleen procedure esophageal. They are going to contribute the form of I&A, but really the hidden power there is the combination of strength from the surgeons that are performing a lot of the benign operations coupled with the strength of the surgeons who are seeing demand in things like colorectal distal pancreatectomy, collectively getting together into the system purchasing suite or decision. It is also pretty powerful. So we don’t really, per se, value them as one-for-one. I think the broader you go between malignant and cancer, I should say, malignant and benign, the more strength you see in terms of placing systems out of that particular vertical which we saw in gynecology and we saw in urology as well.
Calvin Darling: Okay, Tycho, I will give you one last follow-up here.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Just on Japan, can you talk about how the growth trajectory is going to change in the absence of the new procedures. And you alluded to the fact that you are looking for Japan specific data. So you probably won't get the reimbursement code but is that a definitive decision at this point that you won't get it?
Gary Guthart: It is not definitive but the conversation is ongoing and per our statements we think that broad approvals across multiple procedures are unlikely. I can describe the process what the growth rate looks like, I think, is hard to predict. Process wise, we will submit data before the surgical societies. They will in turn work with MHLW. MHLW may require them to solicit and collect data in Japan. That may involve a partial reimbursement for certain number of centers. If so, then that will start the process of data collection for a group of hospitals in Japan. How many and how many procedures concurrently, we don’t have a resolution on yet, but as I said before, as we get closer to it we will share it with you.
Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Okay, thank you.
Gary Guthart: Okay, that was our last question. I would like to close with a letter we received this week from a surgeon and medical director at one of the U.S. academic centers. We talked about our finances and cash flow and so on but this sort of takes it back to what the value of our products is and so this came from a surgeon and medical director. "What you are doing is touching patients' lives. It’s healing them and getting them better. You cannot put a price on curing some of their cancer and doing it with minimal change to their life. It is priceless. Let them inspire you to go ahead and continue the innovation to lead surgery in to the future. Patients are your partners in this endeavor. Sure everything can be refined and everything can be improved but you only get one chance sometimes to cure someone of their cancer. Your technology has given me a step up in that pursuit. Companies that help us change patients' lives will survive and prosper." This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive TeleConference service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Quarter One 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Senior Director of Finance, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical’s first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today’s press release has been posted to our website. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights. Then I will provide an update to our financial forecast for 2013, and finally we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary S. Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. Before we get started describing our quarterly performance, I’d like to make a few comments regarding current events. As you know, we are in the midst of a concerted effort by critics of robotic surgery, to challenge the benefited range of patients, the value it brings to the medical community and the quality of our organization. While taking these allegations very seriously, we remain deeply committed to developing and providing products that are in the surgeons hands, ease the burden of surgery for patients who can benefit from them. We take pride in the benefits provided by our systems, demonstrated a numerous large scale population studies comparing da Vinci surgery to open surgery for several different procedures. We are confident that those who invest their time in a serious review of the clinical literature on da Vinci will find ample evidence, and the benefit it brings to patients, surgeons, hospitals, and the medical community of ours.
 : Turning to our performance in the quarter, we experienced strong growth in general surgery, slower growth in gynecology and return to stability in urology. This resulted in an 18% procedure growth over 2012. The first quarter of 2013 had one fewer surgery day than 2012, taking this into account normalized procedure growth improves to approximately 20%. General surgery growth was led by Single-Site Cholecystectomy and colorectal procedures. Gynecologic procedures for benign indications are typically seasonally slow in the first quarter. However, we’ve experienced slower than expected growth into benign Hysterectomy in this first quarter of 2013. Worldwide urology procedures experienced solid growth aided by the stabilizing of prostatectomy procedures in the United States. Considering the above procedure growth for the quarter came in it at the lower range of our expectations. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. Turning to markets outside of the United States, our first quarter of Si system sales to Japan went well with encouraging early customer demand for the system. We are supporting surgical societies in Japan in their efforts to obtain national reimbursement for procedures beyond prostatectomy. In Europe, procedures and system sales follow the seasonal trends and showed modest growth. We continue to build our team in Europe and I am pleased with our organizational development over the past few quarters. Overall, operating highlights for the first quarter are as follows. Procedures grew 18% over the first quarter of 2012. Adjusting for the number of procedure days in the quarter, normalized growth was approximately 20%. We sold 164 da Vinci Surgical Systems up from 140 during the first quarter of last year. Total revenue was $611 million, up 23% over last year. Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $261 million, up 26% over Q1 of 2012. Total recurring revenue grew to $356 million, up 23% from prior year and comprising 58% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $285 million before non-cash stock option expense, up 27% from the first quarter of last year. Net income was $189 million, up 32% over last year. Earnings per share for the quarter were $4.56 compared to $3.50 in the first quarter of 2012. We ended the quarter with $3.116 billion in cash and investments, up $196 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays in the quarter included $17 million invested in fixed assets and intellectual property. We repurchased $146 million worth of our shares in the quarter. Our product development teams continued to make good progress. This quarter, we initiated our controlled rollout for Single-Site hysterectomy and oophorectomy. Leading surgeons are optimizing their procedure choreography, and we plan to expand our installations, had a measured pace through the year. Early surgeon and patient interest in Single-Site for Hysterectomy is high. We have also initiated our first clinical cases with our da Vinci Stapler. As we have mentioned previously, our first stapling product is focused on colorectal surgery. Earlier clinical results and surgeon feedback on use of the Stapler are very encouraging. Given the subtleties involved in the use and manufacture of surgical Staplers, our rollout plan for the Stapler will be conservative for the year. Turning to system and imaging developments, we continue to invest in expanding indications for Firefly Fluorescence Imaging and in deepening our product offerings in support of system training. We are currently answering FDA questions regarding expanding Firefly indications to include biliary imaging. The intent of this is this indication is to allow surgeons to image the common bile duct in real time during cholecystectomy. On the simulation front, we have added new surgical skill modules to our simulator through our development partnerships. Our medical research team is working with academic centers world wide of face, content, and construct validity stays of the da Vinci Skills Simulator. Early publications of these validations are positive. Lastly, we are initiating our first clinical sites configured with da Vinci Connect over the next few months. da Vinci Connect is our system for remote proctoring. Remote proctoring uses Internet-based conferencing technology to allow a distant surgeon to participate in the da Vinci case with a surgeon on an SI console through video, voice, and illustration. It is intended to augment surgical proctoring by lowering the time, distance, and cost barriers to expert participation during the surgeon’s learning period. We are also investing in the construction of two new training centers that are expected to become operational this year; one increasing the capacity of our training center at our California headquarters and the second new facility in Atlanta to serve our customers in the East. As we enter new surgical markets and drive into new product arenas, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter we added 118 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing, and R&D, bringing our total team to 2,480 employees. I’ll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall L. Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our first quarter revenue was $611 million, up 23% compared with $495 million for the first quarter of 2012 and roughly equal to the $609 million last quarter. First quarter revenues by product category were as follows. First quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $261 million, up 26% compared with $208 million for the first quarter of 2012 and up 3% compared with $254 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by procedure growth of 18%. Sales of new products including Single Site, Vessel Sealer, and Firefly, and higher stocking orders associated with higher system unit sales. The 18% procedure growth was impacted by one additional operating day in the first quarter of 2012 reflecting leap year. Excluding the impact of leap year, procedure growth would have been approximately 20%. Procedure growth also reflects seasonality associated with the benign hysterectomies, which was more pronounced in 2013 compared with 2012 as we achieve deeper penetration in this market. The year-over-year procedure growth was led by U.S. general surgery and gynecology procedures, partially offset by lower U.S. dVPs of approximately a 11%. U.S. dVP procedures are approximately 4% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012. The sequential increase in instrument and accessory revenue compared with the last quarter was driven by the timing of customer orders and new product revenue associated with the increased usage from Firefly, Vessel Sealer, and Single Site. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $2,110 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,990 realized in the first quarter of last year, and the $2,050 realized in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013 was driven primarily by the timing of customer orders. First quarter 2013 systems revenue of $256 million increased 24% compared with $207 million for the first quarter of 2012 and decreased 3% compared with $265 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. Our higher systems revenue compared to the first quarter of last year was driven by higher unit sales and a higher average selling price. We sold 164 systems in the first quarter of 2013 compared with 140 systems in the first quarter of last year, and 175 systems in the seasonally stronger fourth quarter of 2012. Our first quarter 2013 system sales included 25 systems into Japan, where we launched the da Vinci SI that started this year. We sold seven systems into Japan during the first quarter of 2012 and 10 last quarter. Our first quarter average selling price per system was $1.55 million compared with $1.47 million realized in the first quarter of 2012 and $1.49 million realized last quarter. ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators, and Firefly when configured with the system and exclude upgrades. Our higher first quarter 2013 ASP was driven by a higher proportion of dual console configuration in a favorable geographic mix. 48 of the 164 first quarter sales were dual console model compared with 25 of 140 last year and 32 of 175 last quarter. 15 of the 25 units sold in Japan during the first quarter were dual console models. We sold 97 simulators during the quarter, mostly in conjunction with new systems sales compared with 102 last year and 115 last quarter. 39 of our first quarter 2013 system sales involve trade-ins comprised of 30 da Vinci Ss and nine standard models. 46 of our first quarter 2012 sales involve trade-ins and 52 of our fourth quarter 2012 sales involve trade-ins. Service revenue increased to $94 million, up 17% compared with $81 million last year and up 4% compared with $91 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total first quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessories, and service revenues, increased to $356 million, up 23% compared with the first quarter of last year and up 3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. Recurring revenue represented 58% of total first quarter revenue compared with 58% in the first quarter of last year and 57% last quarter.
 : First quarter 2013 international procedure volume was approximately 14% higher than the first quarter of 2012, and 10% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012. During the first quarter of 2013, we sold 49 systems outside of the U.S. compared with 35 in the first quarter of 2012 and 42 last quarter. We sold 16 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 14 in the first quarter of 2012 and 24 last quarter. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the first quarter of 2013 was 71% compared with 71.9% during both the first and fourth quarter of 2012. Our lower first quarter 2013 gross margin percentage resulted primarily from the impact of the medical device excise tax partially offset by the favorable impact of higher system ASPs and higher service margin. Our first quarter 2013 cost of sales including $6.5 million related to the medical device exercise tax. First quarter 2013 operating expenses of $183 million were up 13%, compared with the first quarter of 2012 and down 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. Our higher year-over-year operating expenses were primarily driven by headcount addition. The sequential decrease in operating expenses was driven by lower variable compensation expense and the timing of engineering projects in other expenses. First quarter 2013 operating income was $251 million, or 41% of sales compared with $193 million, or 39% of sales last year, and $248 million, or 41% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2012. First quarter 2013 operating income reflected $38 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $34 million last year and $38 million last quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26%, compared with 27% for the first quarter of 2012 and 31% last quarter. As anticipated our first quarter 2013 income tax expense included the discrete benefit of approximately $7.5 million for the reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit, which become effective January 1st of this year, otherwise our tax rate would have been 29%. Our tax provision for the first quarter of 2012 included a one-time benefit associated with domestic manufacturing tax credit and otherwise our tax rate in that quarter would have been 32%. Our net income was $189 million or $4.56 per share, compared with $144 million or $3.50 per share last year and $175 million or $4.25 per share for the fourth quarter of 2012. Now, moving to cash flow, we ended the first quarter with cash and investments of $3.1 billion, up $196 million compared with December 31, 2012. The increase was driven by $258 million of cash flows from operation plus $89 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $146 million in stock buybacks and $17 million of capital and IP purchases. During the first quarter we bought back 299,000 shares at an average price of $487 per share. As recently announced, our Board of Directors has increased our share buyback authorization by $1 billion including this latest authorization, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of authorized share buyback. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks to go over our sales, marketing, and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the first quarter, we sold 164 da Vinci systems; 115 in the United States, 16 into Europe, and 33 into rest of world markets. As part of the 164 system sales, 9 standard da Vinci systems and 30 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We finished the quarter with a net 125 system additions to the installed base bringing to 2,710, the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide; 1,957 in the United States, 430 in Europe, and 323 in rest of world markets. 75 of the 164 systems installed during the quarters represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total 162 of the 164 systems sold represented da Vinci Si or SIE systems, which included 48 dual console systems. The 49 systems, systems sales internationally included 25 into Japan, 4 into France, and 3 into Turkey. Clinically, Q1 year-over-year procedure growth was approximately 18%, led by the category of general surgery, followed by GYN. General surgery growth was paced by cholecystectomy, followed by colon and rectal resections. As Gary stated, procedure growth reflected seasonality, the reduction of selling days and a slower quarter for benign dVH. dVP more specifically the rate of decline for U.S. dVP, a topic extensively discussed, appears to be flattening out. U.S. dVP was once again up on a sequential basis with a reduced rate of decline as compared to last year. Overall, other urology, as well as international dVP showed solid growth both on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis. Recently released new products continue to perform well, notably Single-Site where customer feedback has been positive and sales have remained strong. Through Q1 2013, we have sold Single-Site instrument and accessory kits to approximately 630 U.S. customers. Our recently launched Vessel Sealer product has picked up clinical momentum with most of the interest coming from the specialties of colorectal, advanced general surgery and GYN. The customer adoption for both da Vinci Simulator and Firefly continues to expand with 97 customers purchasing da Vinci Simulator and 69 customers purchasing Firefly systems as part of their initial system purchase this quarter. In addition, we have begun a phased rollout of the da Vinci surgical stapling system as well as our Single-Site Hysterectomy products. These rollouts will be expanded in a measured fashion, so we do not expect them to contribute materially to 2013 revenue. During the quarter several hundred robotic abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer-reviewed journals, while quarterly clinical conferences produced several live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. As many of you know, we are currently participating at the Annual SAGES Conference which is taking place in Baltimore, the surgeon support we received at this conference thus far has been positive.
 : Unfortunately, most of the media as well as the ACOG commentary were focused on da Vinci’s economic profile versus either vaginal surgery or simple laparoscopy. For decades the popularity of vaginal and laparoscopy approaches the hysterectomy paled in comparison to the number of open hysterectomies being performed within the United States which clearly explains the motivation driving our dVH opportunity. In a recent edition of the Journal, Gynecologic Surgery, a European study discussed this very issue, the study emanated out of Cork University Maternity Hospital in Cork, Ireland, an extremely cost sensitive market with national austerity measures in place. In the analysis, Cork U computed and compared hysterectomy specific hospitalization cost between their hospital and the similarly-sized reference hospital, with a similar hysterectomy treatment mix. The hysterectomy treatment mix in these hospitals included open midline incision, lower transverse incision, LADH and vaginal hysterectomy. They determined that on average an open hysterectomy performed through a midline incision required an eight-day hospitalization, six days for a hysterectomy performed through a lower transverse incision, three days for an LADH, and three days for vaginal hysterectomy. They computed cost per day of hospitalization to be approximately €534. Cork University acquired their da Vinci system in 2008, whereas the reference hospital did not. Following the inclusion of da Vinci, Cork University discovered that their dVH patients were spending only two days in the hospital, and GYN beds were being consumed for fewer days. They also reported that the rate of open surgery has been reducing by 10% per year at Cork, following the introduction of dVH, and is projected to represent only 5% of the total hysterectomies performed during the final year of the study, as compared to 35% open hysterectomy rate in the non-da Vinci reference hospital. When comparing to current mix and extrapolating over and annual basis, 280 hysterectomies, the bed day rate has reduced from 1,134 days to 756 days when incorporating da Vinci, which represents a potential annual savings of over €2,000. In the others comments, they stated, and I quote, in 2009 the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released the statement recommending vaginal hysterectomy as the approach of choice for benign hysterectomies due to reduced operating times when compared to the laparoscopic approach. However, they note that laparoscopic surgery is an alternative to vaginal hysterectomy is not when vaginal hysterectomy is not feasible or indicated. Increasing the rate of vaginal surgery decreases the cost of surgery compared to the open approach due to reduced length of stay. Consideration must be given to the fact that not all surgeries are amendable to the vaginal approach.” One could argue that the same commentary would pertain to let the laparoscopic approach, in that if two has remained in the minority due to clinical and/or technical challenges. The authors concluded their paper by stating “Robotic surgery is associated with reduced hospital stay compared with open surgery, while the initial outlay is expensive, the increased number of patients amendable to this minimally access approach compared with conventional keyhole surgery has the potential for financial savings.” Da Vinci colorectal resections have been expanding rapidly over the past several quarters. The uptake has been driven by surgeons seeking to offer patients in less invasive alternative to open colorectal surgery. While Laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been proven to be safe and defective and has for years been available within several leading institutions throughout the world. It has nonetheless remained largely underpenetrated within the United States. In a recent edition of the journal, Surgical Endoscopy, a study entitled total Mesorectal Excision, a comparison of oncologic and functional results between robotic and laparoscopic rectal surgery was published. The study conducted in Rome was based on 100 patients who had undergone minimally invasive anterior rectal resections with total Mesorectal Excision or TME. 50 consecutive robotic rectal anterior resections with TME were compared to the first 50 consecutive laparoscopic rectal resections with TME. The authors made several comparisons which included operating time, conversion rate, lymph node yields, circumferential margins, length of stay, and sexual functions scores. They reported that the operative times were similar between the two groups with da Vinci holding only a slight advantage. Lymph node yields were greater using da Vinci, 16.5 versus 13.8. Conversions to open surgery were zero within the da Vinci cohort as compared to 12% for the laparoscopic cohort. The circumferential margins less than 2 millimeters were zero using da Vinci as compared to 12% for the lap group. In the authors’ conclusion, they wrote and I quote, robotic TME is oncologically safe and adequate for rectal cancer treatment, showing better results than laparoscopic TME in terms of circumferential margins, conversions, and hospital length of stay. Better recovery in voiding and sexual function is achieved with the robotic technique, close quote. In the early days of an emerging procedure, single-center comparative analysis with strong findings laid the foundation for larger and more comprehensive comparative studies. We would expect this trend to continue within the field of colorectal surgery. This concludes my remarks, and now I’ll turn the time over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2013, including procedures, revenues, and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures; on our last call, we projected our full-year 2013 procedures to growth approximately 20% to 23% from the base of approximately 450,000 procedures performed in 2012. Now based upon first quarter procedure trends, we expect our full-year 2013 procedure growth to be in the lower-end of that range. Moving on to revenues. Last quarter, we forecasted full-year 2013 revenue growth of between 16% and 19%. Based upon favorable new instrument and accessory product sales and utilization, we now expect full-year 2013 revenue growth at the higher end of that range. Our first quarter system ASP of $1.55 million was higher than we expected, reflecting a high proportion of dual console configurations in the system mix. Going forward in 2013, we would expect our systems product mix and overall systems ASP to return towards historical 2012 levels. Now turning to operating income. We continue to expect full-year operating income to fall within a range of between 38% and 39% of net revenue. Our first quarter operating margin of 41% reflected favorable system pricing and timing of operating expenses. In Q2, we would expect operating expenses to increase at least $15 million, reflecting higher variable compensation, prototype, headcount, stock compensation and legal expenses. We continue to expect 2013 stock compensation to total between $184 million and $192 million for the year. Timing of recognition should follow-up quarterly pattern similar to 2012. Amortization of purchased intellectual property which is mostly reported as R&D expense is still expected to come in between $28 million and $30 million in 2013. We continue to expect to other income to total between $18 million and $22 million in 2013. With regard to income tax, as Marshall described, our Q1 tax rate reflected the benefit related to the reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit. For the rest of this year, we continue to anticipate our tax rate to fall within a range of between 28% and 30% of pre-tax income. Our share account for calculating EPS in Q1 2013 was approximately 41.4 million shares. Going forward our share account will depend upon the magnitude and timing of share buybacks. We will continue to be thoughtful in our execution of the 1.2 billion authorized by the Board for that purpose. That concludes our prepared remarks, we will now open the call to your questions. Operator?
Evan Lodes – JP Morgan: Hi, guys. This is Evan Lodes in for Tycho. I guess first question was for Gary, can you disaggregate the slowdown in benign dVH between the seasonal effects that you mentioned such as deductibles and then also the more coordinated efforts that you talked about with regards to the roll-off specifically?
Gary S. Guthart: I think I heard the question, although there is a little bit of background noise on the call. I think the question was can we disaggregate the benign hysterectomy slowdown. No, I think there are a few things going on there. As we look at multi port benign hysterectomy in total, we think our market opportunity is really the open surgical market share. There is still more than 100,000 open benign hysterectomies being done in the U.S. We see three issues impacting benign hysterectomy. First, as we become a larger part of the market, the impact of seasonality plays a proportionally bigger role in our performance. So, it’s simply when a new technique is for a small part of the market the number of unserved patients is sufficiently large that changes in the total number of patient admissions do not materially impact growth. However, as penetration increases the sensitivity to total admissions increases with it. Second, several large healthcare organizations are reporting a greater than expected decline in patient admissions in the first quarter. Given that benign hysterectomy is a large part of our procedure base, that will impact us as well. Third, negative press has some hard to measure impact on benign hysterectomy, although it doesn’t appear to be large, it’s also probably not zero.
Evan Lodes – JP Morgan: Thank you very much. And then the second question, you mentioned the international procedure growth was about 14%, could you help us think about what the growth is in Europe and trends there that you’ve seen recently? Thank you.
Calvin Darling: Yeah, I mean just numerically, the 14% would be higher on the Asia and rest of world markets and a bit lower on the European side.
Evan Lodes – JP Morgan: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair, please go ahead.
Benjamin Andrew – William Blair & Company: Hi, good afternoon. Can you hear me?
Marshall L. Mohr: Hi, Ben.
Gary S. Guthart: Yes, we can.
Benjamin Andrew – William Blair & Company: Okay. Gary, talk a little bit about the guidance of 20% to 23% and targeting kind of the low end of that range, what does it take for you to hit that 20%, does it require a stabilization in benign dVH and again continued stabilization of prostatectomy, and just maybe walk through how you get to that 20%, because we’re struggling a little bit as we try to plug-in the number for Q1 to get there?
Gary S. Guthart: A couple of things and then Calvin may help you a little bit with that as well. But as we look out, we’ve seen three quarters in a row with prostatectomy where it’s sort of finding its footing with regard to the U.S. So we are assuming that that remains -- that trend stays about the same as we go through. General surgery has shown real strength. On benign gynecology, I want to make sure, we’re separating out gynecologic procedures from just hysterectomy. There is more in benign gynecology to just hysterectomy; there is myomectomy, sacrocolpopexy both of which were meeting our expectations in this quarter. The quarter is a little bit hard to interpret just because of the number of operating days and there is little bit of ambiguity as to how many there were in terms of how the holidays played, and we’ll have to see a little bit and impossible to predict the future perfectly. We look out and think that our guidance at the low end makes sense given those, kind of three factors together.
Calvin Darling: Yeah, and you know as we look at our guidance, there are a lot of moving parts more and more as you realize, but, the key areas of growth are the same as they were entering the year, specifically the number of new procedures coming from U.S. general surgery, U.S. gynecology, and international dVP are going to be still the largest areas of growth. As Gary said, based upon customer and surgeon feedback, we have not seen a major impact on the benign dVH procedure demand, although we can’t really predict where that may head in the future. We expect seasonality to play through and we’ll benefit later in the year on some of these things as well, and we do forecast that dVP has bottomed out. So, I think that’s -- having said that, nobody has a crystal ball and we’ll take it one quarter at a time.
Ben Andrew – William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And two more quick questions, Gary. Are you hearing additional chatter or kind of disturbing chatter from either surgeons or hospitals questioning the safety and obviously efficacy of the system, and I know that may be hard to quantify, but does it feel different now then it did a month ago, and were there trends in the quarter or something that got your attention?
Gary S. Guthart:
 :
Ben Andrew – William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then finally, you mentioned something intriguing about SG&A spending, popping up in the second quarter. I thought I heard prototyping in the middle of that list. Can you describe that at all?
Gary S. Guthart:
. :
 :
Ben Andrew – William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you.
Gary S. Guthart: Ben, you had asked a question, just a follow-up on kind of a surgeon’s view or surgeon’s commentary on it, and I’ll tell you one surgeon’s comment to me with regard to some of the criticism that’s been out there. He came back and said, hey, open surgery hasn’t gotten any better for patients and laparoscopy hasn’t gotten any easier for surgeons, and I think that’s true.
Ben Andrew – William Blair & Co. LLC: We definitely heard the same thing. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Lennox Ketner representing Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Lennox Ketner – Bank of America: Hi. Can you hear me okay?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes
Marshall L. Mohr: Yes
Lennox Ketner - Bank of America: Great, just a few questions. First, I’m sorry if I missed this, but I think you said that the dVP was down about 11% year-over-year. But last quarter you had provided, I think the overall growth rates for both general surgery and gynecology as well. Is that something you would be willing to breakout at this time?
Gary S. Guthart: We do that on an annual basis and not quarterly.
Lennox Ketner - Bank of America:
 :
 :
 :
Gary S. Guthart: Yeah. So, for starters, while we had the approval last year, the first clinical cases happened in this quarter, and really the reason of it is two-fold. One is, we want to have outstanding first customer experiences with it, so far we have. The second thing is the supply chain for the surgical stapler is a long one, it’s a full system that has electronics in it, software in it, motor packs, and single use sterilizable products. So we want to make sure that that supply chain is exceptionally stable and ready as we move to scale. And it’s really working, those two things in parallel to make sure we get a great result. Stapling is a subtle product. There are a lot of things about it in terms of both its manufacturing and its use that you want to make sure you get right, and so we’ll be doing that. And as we start to see that stability, then we’ll start to ramp the release.
Lennox Ketner - Bank of America: Okay. Just on a feature standpoint, you feel confident that the version that you have now has all the features that it needs to ultimately be successful?
Gary S. Guthart:
 :
Lennox Ketner - Bank of America: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, last one just on the buyback authorization. I mean, I think there is obviously a much larger authorization that you guys have done in the past. I think people are happy to see that. How should we think about the timing of that going forward, but, you know, in the past you guys have done pretty measured buybacks over time? Should we expect this one to occur anymore quickly than the others or is it going to kind of picking you to be at the same pace as the others described larger overall authorization?
Gary S. Guthart: I think you’ve somewhat characterized how we have pushed it. We’ve not been mechanical. We’ve been very thoughtful about what we’ve done and we’ll continue to be thoughtful. So, you shouldn’t look for any particular standard pattern, if you will. We’ll look for the right opportunity to buyback over time.
Lennox Ketner - Bank of America: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Okay. Next, we will go to the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
David Roman – Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about any efforts you are undertaking or look to undertake to address the weakness in the dVH? I mean obviously, the seasonal piece and macro dynamics are what they are, but maybe any sort of impact you’ve had from the recent noise in the marketplace? What is your plan to sort of start to stem that? And then how long do you think it might take before we start to see some positive return from those efforts?
Gary S. Guthart: On the first comment of what do we think there is in terms of an opportunity in our dVH? First of all, we look out and say often procedures that are still being done through a laparotomy are great opportunity for us. We look around the country to see where those are and our ability to serve those patients. That’s our primary opportunity. You implied in your discussion that the negative press is having a fair impact in this. It’s not clear but that’s true. Right now separating out how much of this is seasonality. How much is just a total inpatient admission, and how much is specific going to it’s actually a hard think to piece apart. Having said that, I think the strength of da Vinci Surgery has been in its clinical outcomes and so that’s where we start relative to open surgery both in the publications and in the education of our sales team and the interaction with hospitals it’s that sort of data, and so we’ve done that and we’ll continue to do that in terms of supplying them the data and the resources they need to approach those patients.
 :
David Roman – Goldman Sachs: That’s helpful. And then I know a lot of the questions on this call regarding the market recent noise and marketplace concerns have been focused on gynecology, but it is fair to say that hasn’t sort of trickled into the other parts you’ve been in some of the newer categories like general surgery that continued to be fairly robust and your ability to attract new users, train new users, I mean any change in sort of your size of your training classes interest level I mean any other metrics that you could help us to gauge this sort of looming question around noise versus reality?
Gary S. Guthart: We have not seen a change in that is our for people be trained and we haven’t seen anything that I can point to in the general surgery marketplace that would indicate a real impact?
Marshall L. Mohr: Yeah, and again I think evidence of that that we have that helps us make that statement or the actual procedure numbers, the number of people who are accessing proctors and training. And just as a level set, GYN if you look at things like Sacrocolpopexy and Myomectomy and Endometriosis Resection. If GYN is end hysterectomy for malignant conditions, this is a very robust category and while dVH Benign is certainly the largest individual segment of that category, as we look out overall at GYN, we’ve remain very encouraged.
David Roman – Goldman Sachs: Okay, and maybe the last question just a follow-up on the share repurchase authorization. You’ve in the past I think you’ve got to use share repurchase to kind of offset the impact of options being exercised and that sort of been not a top use of cash, but sort of something that you’ve done to manage options, dilution. Is there anything different are there prioritization to think about this $1 billion authorization or it’s just the cash balance has got into where it is the stock price is where it is that you need more to offset the impact of options exercised?
Gary S. Guthart: I think number one is in the authorization reflected confidence in the business, but I think that it’s also intended to be a return to shareholders. We’re talking about a $1 billion set more than offset any stock option dilution that we create during the year.
David Roman – Goldman Sachs: Okay, got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Larry Keusch. Please go ahead.
Lawrence Keusch – Raymond James Financial: Gary, there has been obviously a lot of discussion focused on procedures and the impact from the predicts over last several months, but I’m wondering if we can perhaps shift towards system sales obviously quite strong this quarter, but I’m wondering if you’re seeing anything change in the selling cycle or there has been some speculation that hospitals may holdback on purchasing while there is all those noise out there, so any color would be helpful?
Gary S. Guthart: All I can speak to is the first quarter and looking at the first quarter we haven’t seen any meaningful impact of negative press on capital sales. In fact, the capital side was pretty strong as you mentioned not only in systems as a whole, but and the attachment of some of the products we’ve added to assign. So, dual console sale, simulator sales, Firefly demand have continued to be strong, again don’t have a crystal ball is to what happens in the future, but so far the conversations have been pretty straightforward.
Lawrence Keusch – Raymond James Financial: Okay, great. And then this is also come up over the last several calls, you’ve expressed some need to work on the European organization, so I’m just curious kind of take your temperature little bit on where we are in that process?
Gary S. Guthart: I think that we’ve been making on a good progress, I think that it’s been measured, but we’ve been adding resources in a few places, some of that has been leadership resources, some of that has been people in the sales force experienced, people into the sales force and some of it is in areas such as regulatory and reimbursement, we’ve made some great hires there they are integrating well and as we’ve said in the past this is something that will happen over quarters not over days, but we are pleased with our partners.
Lawrence Keusch – Raymond James Financial: Okay. And then lastly, just on the usage of cash obviously, share repurchase remains out there, but what are the latest thoughts around potentially using cash for some M&A opportunities?
Marshall L. Mohr: Go ahead.
Gary S. Guthart: So, I think there is, our eyes are always open for opportunities for a few things and some of it has been as you know on the past looking for technologies that we think did really well with robotic surgery and advancing the ability of surgeons and the systems to do more. We continue to be looking forward and able to acquire those things, we think make a difference. We also think that investments in markets not in the United States are really important. You’ve seen this through that in the past. And we continue to do so in terms of investing into existing organizational frameworks in Japan and in Korea and also positioning ourselves for success in other markets or U.S. having cash help us to do that as well.
Lawrence Keusch – Raymond James Financial: Okay, terrific. Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Demchick – Morgan Stanley: Hello, this is actually Jon in for David. So, we had a few questions. One just while procedures were a bit slower than expected, instrument revenue is still strong and I guess that was more related to the revenue per procedure being higher. And I’m just wondering if you could maybe break that out and how much of that was related to stocking whereas how much of that was some of the more advanced tools? You mentioned thoughts on the system ASP is to normalize down a bit, any thoughts to where revenue procedure should go throughout the year?
Gary S. Guthart: We’ve actually seen a bit of an uptick in the base, what we call the base. And so if you parse out the stocking orders associated with new system purchases, we see a little uptick in the base and that reflects the new products. So that reflects usage of Firefly, usage of vessel sealing. And so, I think it was also benefited, the quarter was also benefited by the timing of purchases of buying through distributors and other customers where they’re entering their new fiscal year and so they may have bought more. And so I think there is a little bit higher than maybe we would expect going forward, but it’s definitely being benefited by the new products.
Aleks Cukic: And we’ve always talked there is a lot of moving parts in this overall instrument and accessory per procedure. We have talked in the past about a natural trend downward as the impact of stocking orders becomes less on our larger installed base and procedure mix moving towards the simpler mix maybe moving downwards but now, what we’re seeing, the impact of the new products, even beyond the initial stocking of the new products which we’ve talked before. We’re talking about utilization of products like the Vessel Sealer and the Firefly in procedures, which getting those procedures utilized and those products used in procedures. It’s allowing us to really to capture larger portion of the hospitals procedure spend through the da Vinci platform. And so directionally, we probably see that winning the day at least for the balance of this year.
Jonathan Demchick – Morgan Stanley: Thank you. That’s very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on Single-Site chole. First, I was more curious to, if you could break out how much Single-Site chole is out of our chole is? And then also it just seen kept increased each year on the Single-Site side, and I was wondering if you can maybe discuss how much of those are VP buyers, how much of those are new adaptors and just what you’ve seen there?
Marshall L. Mohr: Yeah. At this point in time, the Single-Site chole, it’s really moving from an initial introduction into more key element of our business here, a lot more matured status. We’ve talked about the number of customers who bought Single-Site products. We may move away from that. I think as it becomes part of the norm, the portion that’s Single-Site versus multi-port that’s always transitioning as most people are aware the multi-port side is generally part of the training pathway to move towards single port, but I think the multi-port side is really the stat as an avenue to move towards the ultimate destination of the single port. So it’s probably not as important at that point, at any of time of how many of those are.
Gary S. Guthart: Just a qualitative remark on the reorder rate. We have been watching and we’ve been pleased so far. Reorder rate has been positive for us.
Jonathan Demchick – Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Okay. Next from the line of (inaudible) with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks very much. I thought maybe I would first ask about Single-Site for dVH. I think I was a little bit surprised in kind of thinking back in your traction with Single-Site for chole and what that did in 2012, essentially its first year. In your comments that you thought it might not have much of an impact this year. So I thought maybe you could explain the differences between the rollout here versus the rollout for chole’s and why it’s going to take a little bit longer?
Gary S. Guthart: Well, again, as you know, I mean, we’re pretty measured in our approach with all of these various procedures. And I think when you look at Single incision hysterectomy, you’re looking at products that are required to be made which we’re doing and then we know how to do that. And then you’re looking at really understanding, the physicians are looking at really understanding procedure choreography, how do I do this, how do I do that, how do I close the cup, how do I take the next et cetera. And so, it’s difficult to try to assign a reasonable timeline to how the choreography will go, in addition to the general issues of manufacturing new products getting new supply chain down et cetera. So we’re being pretty cautious about that. Now, if it turns out that that changes in time will certainly let you know. But I think there is a, I think there are number of surveys that people have done and we’ve done ourselves, where there is a real excitement for from the customer. And so we just want to make sure, do you take this into consideration and that work that into your expectations because it’s really too early to call.
Unidentified Analyst: All right, okay. And then on the system side, just the comment you made about system mix in ASPs maybe not holding through the whole year. I’m just wondering, if that’s more product mix related or is that geography related? And if it’s on a product side just specifically what you’re thinking in terms of the products that might not be relating the year that you’ve been selling.
Marshall L. Mohr: Yeah, it’s primarily product mix and we had 48 of the 164 units were dual console systems in the first quarter and that’s by far in a way the highest proportion that we’ve had. We’d see that attach rate returning to more historical levels and as such the ASP. It’d be less than we saw here in the first quarter, maybe more in line with what we saw throughout 2012.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then last one from me, I realized that with regard to the FDA MedSun survey, I guess there was only nine people or so may be it’s not even a survey or definitely not a government probe, it’s may be some would call it. But have you guys had talked to any of the doctors involved in that kind of inquiry or do you know anything about the reports that might be coming out or what you might be anticipating?
Gary S. Guthart: As far as we know it was a confidentially run survey and so we have no, nothing to share on that front.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks very much guys.
Gary S. Guthart: All right, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our final question today will come from the line of Rick [Wise] with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Miroslava Minkova – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, it’s actually Miroslava for Rick today. Let me start with asking a question on Japan could not [help] but note of the significant number of systems you played there this quarter and it was coincided with the Si approval in Japan. Was the Si what you needed to help unlock this market to some extent? And related to that should we expect this kind of rate to continue or was this, do you view this is as an anomaly as you launch the Si?
Gary S. Guthart: I think that they were happy to get a Si approval and I think it’s been well received. I think that there is some amount of early excitement having to do with Si long-term as you look at that market. Procedure reimbursement is going to be the thing that is the long and sustained growth path. And so I think system sales in Japan are going to be lumpy, until additional procedures are reimbursed. And that’s something that we’re working with the surgical societies on supporting and helping them to complete that activity.
Miroslava Minkova – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, and…
Gary S. Guthart: One last question please.
Miroslava Minkova – Stifel Nicolaus: And going back to just the both concerted effort by the critics of surgery. I was wondering if you have any plans to highlight some of your data on the outcomes and perhaps the economics of your procedures. And it goes back to what was asked earlier, but maybe if I could ask it a little bit differently has your conversation with your customers changed in any way as a result of the negative press?
Gary S. Guthart: It was two questions. On the first one, do we have plans to share our data? Yes, we do. And we have been and we will continue to do so. In terms of the conversations that occur with customers over this and in essence the conversations with customers are amongst the most straightforward because they understand the issues on all sides. The conversations really come down to their own experiences and the data and we’re happy to and well, condition well positioned to have those conversations. We’ll continue to do so. And as additional data comes out, we were happy to share with.
Miroslava Minkova – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, thank you.
Gary S. Guthart: That was our last question. In closing, da Vinci Surgery has proven safety, efficacy, economic and ergonomic benefits when compared to the open surgical procedures, it is replacing. We are steadfast in our conviction in the value that da Vinci has and will bring to medicine. And we thank you for your support and helping Intuitive expand the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. We’ll look forward to speaking to you again in three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and using the AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.

With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary S. Guthart: Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2012 has been a productive year at Intuitive, in the past year our focus was in the following four areas; first, continued growth in gynecology and urology worldwide. Second, disciplined execution of our Single-Site and vessel sealing launches. Third, building robust clinical programs with leading customers in emerging procedures in general surgery, thoracic surgery and transoral surgery. And finally strengthening our capabilities in international markets. In reviewing the year I'll turn first to procedures. Year-over-year growth in procedures finished at 25%, led by continued uptick in gynecology and growing use of da Vinci in general surgery. The gynecology growth was broad-based with increased use of da Vinci surgery for gynecologic oncology, hysterectomy, myomectomy, and sacrocolpopexy. General surgery growth was substantial in the year led by increased use of da Vinci in colorectal procedures and Cholecystectomy, the latter driven by interest in da Vinci Single-Site. Global urology as a category was up slightly for the year, pressured by a significant reduction in prostatectomies in the United States. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we believe the reduction in prostatectomy is the result of a combination of factors including recommendations moving away from the use of PSA testing for early detection and an increase in non-definitive treatment pathways such as watchful waiting. However we did see a quarterly sequential rise in the United States in prostatectomies from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2012. Aleks will take you through greater detail on our procedure performance later in the call. Turning to da Vinci surgery outside of the United States in 2012 we focused on improving our performance in Asia and in Europe. In Japan, reimbursement approval for da Vinci Prostatectomy contributed to significant early uptake of systems and procedures. In the fourth quarter, we have received clearance for our da Vinci Si System in Japan and customer shipments for Si are planned to commence in the first quarter of 2013. We expect progress in Japan to proceed in steps as we pursue additional instrument regulatory clearances and additional procedure reimbursement. In Europe, we made progress in the fourth quarter, seeing a significant increase in system sales as we invested in deepening our organization. However for our commentary through the year, we have more work to do in building our organization to perform in a challenging environment. We expect these challenges in Europe and our investments to continue for the next several quarters. Our product launches proceeded well in 2012, response to our da Vinci Vessel Sealer and Single-Site instrument kit was positive in the year, with over 450 Si customers purchasing Single-Site starter kits. Surgeon acceptance of Vessel Sealer has been encouraging with Vessel Sealer used focused on colorectal surgeons as well as GYN and Oncologist. We received 510(k) clearance in the United States for our da Vinci Stapler and we planned to start a controlled roll out over the next several weeks. Our rollout this year for our Stapler will be carefully phased and focused on excellent customer experiences. For our prior calls, in Q3 of 2012 we submitted a 510(k) for an additional set of instruments and an expanded indication for Single-Site, for use in Hysterectomy and Nephrectomy. Our dialog with FDA on this kit has been constructive. In imaging, we submitted a 510(k) application to expand indications for our Firefly Fluorescence imaging system to use in biliary imaging. We believe this will have application for use in imaging in the common bile duct during Cholecystectomy, and we’ll complement the use of Single-Site.
 : Turning to operating highlights for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 25% over the fourth quarter of last year. We sold 175 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 152 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Total revenue for the quarter was $609 million, up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $254 million, up 29%. We generated an operating profit of $286 million in the quarter before non-cash stock compensation expense, up 22% from the fourth quarter of last year and GAAP net income grew to $175 million, up 16%. We ended the year with $2.921 in cash and investments, up $219 million from last quarter and up $749 million from last year. We received $263 million in cash during the year from the exercise of stock options and invested $180 million in intellectual property, working capital, property, plant and equipment, and $238 million in stock repurchases for the year. In the quarter, we added 170 people to our team predominantly in our clinical sales force, our manufacturing team and design functions in Q4, bringing our total team to 2,362 employees. Looking to 2013, our priorities are as follows: first, continued focus on use of da Vinci in gynecology; second, supporting emerging growth for da Vinci in general surgery; third, disciplined execution of our stapling and Single-Site for hysterectomy launches, focused on outstanding early customer experiences; and finally, continuing to strengthen our capabilities in international markets particularly Europe and Japan. I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer to take us through our financial performance in greater detail.

I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer to take us through our financial performance in greater detail.
Marshall L. Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our fourth-quarter revenue was $609 million, up 23% compared to $497 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 and up 13% compared to $538 million last quarter. Fourth quarter revenues by product category were as follows; fourth quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $254 million, up 29% compared with $196 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 and up 16% compared with $218 million in the third quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase in I&A was driven by procedure growth of approximately 25%, sales of new instrument and accessory products, including Single-Site, Vessel Sealer and Firefly and higher stocking orders associated with higher system unit sales. The year-over-year procedure growth was led by U.S. gynecology and general surgery procedures, partially offset by lower growth in Europe and a year-over-year decrease in U.S. dVP's of approximately 17%. The sequential increase in I&A revenue compared with the last quarter was driven by higher procedure volume benefitting from favorable fourth quarter seasonality in benign procedures, higher new product sales, higher initial stocking orders, and the timing of distributor orders. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $2,050 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,980 realized in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the third quarter of 2012. The sequential year-over-year increases were driven by higher new product sales, including Vessel Sealers, Single-Site kit, and Firefly kits. Higher initial stocking orders associated with higher systems unit sales, and the timing of distributor orders. Fourth quarter 2012 systems revenue, $265 million, increased 18% compared with $225 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 14% compared with $232 million for the third quarter of 2012. We saw 175 systems in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with 152 systems in the fourth quarter of 2011, and 155 systems in the third quarter of 2012. Our fourth quarter average sales price per system was $1.49 million, slightly above the $1.47 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $1.48 million realized last quarter. ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators, and Firefly when configure with the systems and exclude upgrades. Fourth quarter ASP's benefited from the favorable mix of dual console systems, Firefly enabled systems, and direct sales to Europe. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer, and trade-in mix as well as foreign exchange rates on direct sales to international customers. We sold 150 simulators during the quarter, mostly in conjunction with new system sales compared with 123 last year and 87 last quarter. We sold 32 dual console systems compared with 29 last year and 20 last quarter. 52 of our fourth quarter 2012 system sales involve trade-in comprised of 40 da Vinci S and 12 standard models. 50 of our fourth quarter 2011 sales all trade-in, and 34 of our third 2012 sales all trade-in. Service revenue increased to $91 million, up 20% compared with $75 million last year and up 3% compared with $88 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total fourth quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to $344 million, up 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2011 and up 13% compared with the third quarter of 2012. Recurring revenue represented 57% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 55% in the fourth quarter last year and 57% last quarter. International revenue results were as follows. Fourth quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $131 million, up 23% compared with revenue of $107 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and up 14% compared with revenue of $115 million in the third quarter of 2012. Our year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter international revenue growth was driven by increased procedures and higher system revenue. Fourth quarter 2012 international procedure volume was approximately 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011, and 15% higher than the seasonally lower third quarter of 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we sold 42 systems outside the U.S. compared with 39 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 41 last quarter. We sold 24 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 23 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 13 last quarter. We sold 10 systems in Japan this quarter compared with five last year and 16 last quarter. A higher mix of systems to direct customers in Europe also contributed to higher system revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter and the fourth quarter 2011. Aleks will provide additional details in international system sales. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 71.9% compared with 73.1% during the fourth quarter of 2011, with 72.5% last quarter. Our lower year-over-year gross margin percentage resulted primarily from lower margins earned on our newer Single-Site and Vessel Sealer products, are slight decline in margin percentage compared with the third quarter is mostly due to the lower margins on a higher volume of our Vessel Sealer product. Fourth quarter 2012; operating expenses of $190 million were up 16%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2011, and up 6% compared with the third quarter of 2012. Our higher fourth quarter 2012 operating expenses were primarily driven by variable compensation associated with our higher fourth quarter revenue and headcount addition. Fourth quarter 2012 operating income was $248 million or 41% of sales compared with $200 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2011, and $211 million or 39% of sales for the third quarter of 2012. Fourth quarter 2012 operating income reflected $38 million of non-cash stock compensation expense, compared with $35 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, and $47 million last quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 31%, compared with 26% for the fourth quarter of 2011, and 15% last quarter. I want to remind you that the third quarter of 2012 tax rate of 15% included discrete tax benefits of $38 million associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations. Our fourth quarter 2011 rates up 26% reflected the federal R&D credit and discrete benefits associated with state tax return. Our fourth quarter 2012 rate up 31% is in line with our expectation and excluded the impact of the federal R&D credit reinstatement which was enacted in 2013 and will be reflected at the discrete item in the first quarter of 2013. We estimate the R&D tax credit benefit for 2012 will be between $6 million and $8 million. Our net income was $175 million or $4.25 per share compared with $151 million from $3.75 per share from the fourth quarter of 2011 and $183 million or $4.46 per share for the third quarter of 2012. Excluding the third quarter discrete tax benefits of $38 million, our third quarter net income would have been $145 million or $3.54 per share. Let me quickly summarize our results for the full year of 2012. Procedures grew by 25% to approximately 450,000. Total revenue was $2.179 billion up 24% compare with $1.757 billion last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 27% and an increase in systems revenue of 20%. Full year operating income was $878 million, up 26% compared with $695 million last year. Operating income included $153 million of stock-based compensation charges compared with $136 million in 2011. Net income was $657 million or $15.94 per share compared with $495 million or $12.32 per share last year. 2012 net income included approximately $46 million associated with statutes of limitations and a change in rules for 199 tax credit. Excluding these items, net income would have been $610 million or $14.85 per share. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $814 million compared with $678 million last year. Now, moving on to cash flows. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and investments of $2.9 billion up $220 million compared with September 30, 2012. The increase was driven by $217 million of cash flows from operations about $87 million from the exercise of stock-option, partially offset by $53 million in stock buybacks and $61 million of capital and IT purchases. We bought back 102,000 shares at an average price of $524 per share, and we have $330 million Board authorized buybacks remaining. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks to go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the fourth quarter we sold 175 da Vinci systems, 133 in the United States, 24 into Europe and 18 into rest of world markets. As part of the 175 system sales, 12 standard da Vinci systems and 40 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We had a net 123 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2585 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 1878 in the United States, 416 in Europe, and 291 in rest of world markets. 114 of the 175 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 167 of the 175 system sold represented da Vinci Si or Si-e systems, which included 32 dual console systems. The 42 system sales internationally included 10 into Japan, four into Italy and three into the countries of Denmark, Switzerland, and Canada. Overall, our da Vinci sales remained strong through the year totaling 620 systems. Clinically, we finish the year strong with Q4 year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 25%. The specialties of GYN and general surgery were responsible for most of this growth. dVP more specifically U.S. dVP, a topic we’ve extensively discussed over the past several quarters declined 17% on a Q4 over Q4 basis, but was up 2% on a sequential basis, while the rate of decline has tampered a bit, we are not in position to declare an endpoint to its decline. Our fourth quarter growth rate matched our 2012 overall procedure growth rate of 25%. U.S. procedure growth for the year was approximately 26% as compared to 23% for our international markets. The specialties of GYN and general surgery contributed the overwhelming majority of 2012 procedure growth. Benign hysterectomy, Cholecystectomy, colon and rectal resections, endometriosis resection, partial nephrectomy, and sacrocolpopexy were the largest individual contributors to procedure growth, which more than offset the decline within our 2012, U.S. dVP business. The U.S. procedure breakdown for 2012 was as follows; total procedures grew to approximately 373,000, up from 292,000 in 2011. Total GYN grew to approximately 222,000 procedures, up from 170,000 in 2011. dVH accounted for approximately 176,000 procedures, up from 140,000 in 2011. Urology accounted for approximately 88,000 procedures, which were down from approximately 93,000 in 2011. U.S. dVP declined from approximately 73,000 to 62,000 procedures. general surgery procedures increased to approximately 42,000, up from 15,000 in 2011, representing a 173% increase. Recently released new products continue to do well, notably Single Site. Early customers’ feedback has been positive and our initial sales have been strong. through the fourth quarter, we’ve sold Single-Site instrument in accessory kids to approximately 450 U.S. customers. Our recently launched Vessel Sealer product continues to pick up clinical momentum with most of the interest coming from colorectal, advanced general and GYN clinicians. The customer adoption for both da Vinci Simulator and Firefly continues to expand, with 115 customers purchasing a da Vinci Simulator and 88 customers purchasing Firefly systems, as part of their da Vinci purchase this quarter. During the quarter, several hundred robotic abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer-reviewed journals while quarterly conferences produced several live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. Some of our early general surgery success is rooted within complex procedures, which are often considered difficult to perform through traditional laparoscopic technique. Laparoscopic mid and low rectal cancer resections have for years proved challenging for even the most advanced laparoscopic surgeons and as a result, clinical adoption remains low. The added benefit of da Vinci’s articulated instrumentation, Intuitive movement and magnified 3D HD vision, has provided a new foundation for MIS advancement in this field. A recent three arm comparison out at the Department of Surgery at Yonsei University College of Medicine was published in the anal surgery, the study reported pathologic results, morbidity, preoperative recovery and short-term oncologic results of 165 patients undergoing robotic laparoscopic and open, mid and low rectal cancer procedures. The findings from this case, this case match study revealed that robotic surgery for the treatment of mid to low rectal cancer resulted in significant decreases in the amount of analgesia used, postoperative pain and length of stay. Although sphincter-preserving procedures were frequently performed with robotic surgery, the incidents of circumferential margin involvement and immediate postop vomiting problems showed a significant decrease with robotic surgery as compared with open surgery. Robotic surgery showed better recovery outcomes than lab surgery with regard to time to resume diet and length of hospital stay. The visual analog scale was significantly lower in robotic surgery than in laparoscopic surgery and open surgery from postoperative days one through five and no significant differences were found in two year disease free survival rate between the three groups, causing the authors to conclude anticlot, robotic surgery maybe an effective tool in the effort to maximize the advantages of minimally invasive surgery and the management of mid and low rectal cancers. The clinical pursuit toward nephron-sparing kidney surgery has increased significantly over the past several years and with more and more urologists adopting Partial Nephrectomy. A 500 patient study out of the Cleveland clinic entitled Comparative Outcomes and Assessment of Trifecta in 500 robotic and laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy was published in the Journal urology. Trifecta is defined as a partial nephrectomy where warm ischemia time is kept below 25 minutes with negative surgical margins and no perioperative complications. The study reported that even with a more complex tumor profiles found in the da Vinci cohort operating times were nearly 22 minutes less as compared to the laparoscopic cohort, 169 minutes versus 191 minutes. Intra-operative complications, associated with da Vinci patients were less than half when compared to laparoscopy, 2.6% as compared to 5.6%. Postoperative complications were 24.5 in the da Vinci cohort as compared to 32% for patients within the laparoscopic arm. Positive surgical margins were 2.9% in the da Vinci cohort as compared to 5.9 for laparoscopy. The overall Trifecta rate was significantly higher in the da Vinci cohort at 58.7% as compared to 31.6% for the laparoscopic group. These findings led to the author's conclusion and “our large analysis shows that robotic partial nephrectomy offers a wider range of indications, better operative outcomes and lower perioperative morbidity compared to laparoscopic partial nephrectomy”. Overall request for Trifecta seems to be better accomplished by robotic partial nephrectomy, thus likely to become the new standard technique for minimally invasive partial nephrectomy, close call. Once again the category of GYN contributed greater total procedure growth than any specialty we serve. da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy volume trails only da Vinci Hysterectomy within this specialty and it continued its solid growth during the year. In a recent edition of female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, physicians from the University of South Florida reported the results of their 164 patient study comparing da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy to Open Sacrocolpopexy. This retrospective study focused on costs, operative time, and the length of stay for each group. Within this study both system costs and maintenance costs were considered and included. The authors reported that the median operative time for Open Sacrocolpopexy and da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy was 166 minutes and 212 minutes respectively. Estimated blood loss averaged 150 milliliters in the Open Sacrocolpopexy as compared to just 50 milliliters within the da Vinci patient cohorts. Length of stay for the da Vinci group averaged two days as compared to three days for the Open Sacrocolpopexy group. However 48% of the women treated within the da Vinci group experienced a length of stay of less than 24 hours as compared to just 1% for the women undergoing in Open Sacrocolpopexy. The median direct costs reported for the da Vinci group was $6,668 as compared to $7,804 for the open group. The overall costs reported for the robotics group was $9,725 as compared to $12,485 for the Open Sacrocolpopexy group with similar readmission rates at 30 days post-op. The author stated that while da Vinci sacrocolpopexy took slightly longer to perform than in open sacrocolpopexy, both the direct and indirect cost for the da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy was less than for open sacrocolpopexy. This concludes my remarks. And I’ll now turn the time over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with our financial forecast for 2013 including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures, in 2013, we expect procedure growth to be driven by U.S. gynecology, U.S. general surgery and international dVP procedures. We expect our 2013 total procedures to grow approximately 20% to 23% from the base of approximately 450,000 procedures performed in 2012. Based on an increasing proportion of the nine short-term elected procedures in our procedure mix, we anticipate a more pronounced quarterly seasonality impact in 2013 as compared to 2012, resulting in proportionally lower Q1 and Q3 procedure volumes and proportionally higher Q4 volumes.
 : As a result, total first quarter 2013 revenue is likely to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2012. All of 2013 revenues particularly capital sales are subject to the impact of economic conditions. Now turning to operating income; our full year 2012 operating income was 40.3% of revenue. In 2013, as we reviewed on our last call, the medical device tax has become effective. Based upon our 2012 regional and product mix, we would estimate the tax to equate to roughly 1.1% of our consolidated revenue. We plan to record the expense as a component of cost of sales, thus impacting both gross and operating profit margins. We also expect the impact of new products to shift our overall gross margin percentage slightly lower in 2013. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in field sales and training resources to support procedure adoption. Based upon these factors, we expect our 2013 operating income to fall within a range of between 38% and 39% of revenue. Consistent with prior years, we would expect our operating income as a percent of revenue to be lower in the first quarter of 2013, reflecting system sales and procedure seasonality. 2013 operating expenses should follow a quarterly growth pattern similar to 2012 with Q1 reflecting the full quarter impact of our Q4 new hires. We expect our non-cash stock compensation charges to increase from $153 million reported in 2012, to approximately $184 million to $192 million in 2013. Amortization of purchased and intellectual property, which is mostly reported as R&D expense is expected to increase from $23 million in 2012, to $28 million to $30 million in 2013. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, was approximately $16 million in 2012. We expect other income to grow to between $18 million and $23 million in 2013. With regard to income tax, on our last call we have estimated a 2013 income tax rate of between 29% and 31% of pretax income. Now including the impact of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2013, we anticipate our base full year tax rate to fall within the range of between 28% and 30% of pretax income. As Marshall mentioned, we expect to recognize a discrete benefit of between $6 million and $8 million during the first quarter of 2013 related to the reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit. This discrete item will result in a downward adjustment of our Q1 2013 income tax expense from the $28 million to $30 million full year rates. We estimate our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 2013, will be approximately 41.2 million shares. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for your questions.
 : As a result, total first quarter 2013 revenue is likely to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2012. All of 2013 revenues particularly capital sales are subject to the impact of economic conditions. Now turning to operating income; our full year 2012 operating income was 40.3% of revenue. In 2013, as we reviewed on our last call, the medical device tax has become effective. Based upon our 2012 regional and product mix, we would estimate the tax to equate to roughly 1.1% of our consolidated revenue. We plan to record the expense as a component of cost of sales, thus impacting both gross and operating profit margins. We also expect the impact of new products to shift our overall gross margin percentage slightly lower in 2013. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in field sales and training resources to support procedure adoption. Based upon these factors, we expect our 2013 operating income to fall within a range of between 38% and 39% of revenue. Consistent with prior years, we would expect our operating income as a percent of revenue to be lower in the first quarter of 2013, reflecting system sales and procedure seasonality. 2013 operating expenses should follow a quarterly growth pattern similar to 2012 with Q1 reflecting the full quarter impact of our Q4 new hires. We expect our non-cash stock compensation charges to increase from $153 million reported in 2012, to approximately $184 million to $192 million in 2013. Amortization of purchased and intellectual property, which is mostly reported as R&D expense is expected to increase from $23 million in 2012, to $28 million to $30 million in 2013. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, was approximately $16 million in 2012. We expect other income to grow to between $18 million and $23 million in 2013. With regard to income tax, on our last call we have estimated a 2013 income tax rate of between 29% and 31% of pretax income. Now including the impact of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2013, we anticipate our base full year tax rate to fall within the range of between 28% and 30% of pretax income. As Marshall mentioned, we expect to recognize a discrete benefit of between $6 million and $8 million during the first quarter of 2013 related to the reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit. This discrete item will result in a downward adjustment of our Q1 2013 income tax expense from the $28 million to $30 million full year rates. We estimate our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 2013, will be approximately 41.2 million shares. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Lennox Ketner with Bank of America.
Lennox Ketner – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hi, can you hear me, okay?
Gary S. Guthart:  Yeah.
Lennox Ketner – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Great. Congratulations on a good quarter. I guess first on, I just wanted to touch base on general surgery and the growth you’re seeing in Cholecystectomy. I am wondering at this point in Europe is it possible to speak kind of either quantitatively or qualitatively to how much of that uptick you think is trialing versus the key procedures? I don’t know, if you can give any sense as to what percentage of the 450 customers that have bought Single-Site, kits have bought second kits or if it’s possible to speak it although to how much do you think is trialing versus the key procedures?
Aleks Cukic: Well, I think it’s really too early to say what is a trend, what is ultimately a long-term expectation. It’s our belief and what we can say at this point, and it’s our belief that with 450 U.S. customers purchasing starter kids that there’s a lot of interest in people moving towards single incision surgery. trying to define how many of those we will have going forward that a part of the initial purchase is difficult to say. But I think we’re most pleased with the fact that it is indeed a large number of U.S. customers that are going through the purchasing activity and actually doing these procedures today.
Lennox Ketner – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. and then just as a follow-up. there is some concern around the recent AAGL statement regarding robotic hysterectomies, in fact that AAGL doesn’t believe it should be used to replace laparoscopic hysterectomies, I know that most of your hysterectomy procedures that are being done right now are – it’s actually replacing open surgeries that I’m wondering if you could maybe just frame for people on a go-forward basis, what percentage of the hysterectomy market, you think is still being done as open procedures, just so people have a sense as to what the remaining opportunity is there in terms of simply converting open procedures to robotic?
Gary S. Guthart: Well, you are right, I think many of the studies that were cited in the AAGL statement actually compare robotic surgery to laparoscopic surgery, and really failed to recognize that the majority of the robotic cases would have probably previously been done via laparotomy. We had as you recall as we’ve gone through our sizing if you will of our target market, we’ve talked about this pretty specifically over the years, when we started really with the da Vinci Hysterectomy, I think it was estimated that somewhere along the lines of 66% of the hysterectomies performed in the United States were being performed through laparotomy. I believe the solution database, which is a division of Thomson Reuters, I think in their most recent publication I think goes to 2011, they estimated that only 39% of the procedures in the United States, now the hysterectomy procedures are being performed through laparotomy.

Lennox Ketner – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. thanks very much. 
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ben Andrew – William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon guys, two questions from me. first, can you talk about the adoption curve that you’ve seen in Gen Surg so far and if you adjust for the installed base change, how it compares to maybe dVH most appropriately?
Aleks Cukic: Well, it’s interesting in general surgery versus let’s say dVH, as we’re talking about a category. within the general surgery category if I’m not mistaken, there have been some where around 40 plus procedures that have gone into the category of general surgery that have been done – performed with da Vinci. So it’s difficult to really compare apples-to-apples between a category and let’s say something like dVH, which is a single procedure and it’s even more difficult comparing it to let’s say dVP, which is a single procedure that is always done for a single disease, which is cancer. In other words, there’s just too many inconsistencies between the three, but what we will say is within the category of general surgery, the two procedures that are driving a great deal of that growth are Cholecystectomy and colon surgery, not just low anterior resection, but right colons, left colons, transverse colons et cetera.
Ben Andrew – William Blair & Co. LLC: And Aleks, can you talk a little bit about the typical experience for a new general surgeon starting out in sort of wanting to do Single-Site chole or whatever, is there a typical kind of process they go through and how quickly, people are coming up that curve?
Aleks Cukic: That depends on what their experience is going into that case. In other words, are they completely laparoscopically trained, are they laparoscopically naive, are they robotically trained, robotically naïve, and I think each one of those is a little bit different, but I would say that by and large, you will have people that will do multi-incisioned cholecystectomies with the traditional da Vinci system or they will do some other procedures prior to moving into the single incision surgeries. I don’t know that I can say that there is a typical profile and/or a typical experience.
Ben Andrew – William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just maybe a quick question for Marshall, can you talk a little bit about the expectations on guidance, and specifically thinking about Europe, if you guide to the 20% to 23% procedure growth, does that give you 25% U.S. and 15% Europe or international more broadly, just characterize for us what you built in there, please? Thanks.
Marshall L. Mohr: We haven’t broken it down and we’ve given you a range, because there is some uncertainty associated with certain elements of the guidance itself. And so, I’m not going to break it down into those details.
Ben Andrew – William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you.
Aleks Cukic: Yeah.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David R. Lewis – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Aleks, I wonder if you could tell us maybe in the back half of 2012 or for all 2012, you think about total general surgery procedures, either in terms of adoption curve steepness either in Single-Site Chole versus LAR. Where you're seeing a steeper relative adoption curve of where the contribution to growth is stronger?
Aleks Cukic: Well, it is too early to say. As you know with adoption curves, it's dangerous to try to project steepness too early in the equation. So try and do really pull out an individual point today and draw a lot of conclusions from it is probably dangerous. But in terms of overall growth, I mean cholecystectomy is as we have said, I think in our previous call is our third largest overall procedure, and that's all cholecystectomy including Single-Site and for incision cholecystectomy, so that one would be growing at a steeper rate.
David R. Lewis – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, very helpful. And then Marshall just a quick question on margins, it sounds like some of the dynamic is mix with some of your higher growth procedures coming in at maybe a slightly lower GM. How much of that is simply temporary, when you start getting real scale advantages, back half ‘13 and ‘14, does that sort of vanish and get back to a corporate gross margin for consumables that's more appropriate or are we always going to see some sort of a drag here, just based on how you are pricing somebody’s individual units?
Marshall L. Mohr: This is the variation in margin really have to do with the introduction of new products. And the margins that are earned under this new product. Initially you are dealing with low-volumes, you're dealing with maybe non optimized, may be factoring in and design, those products are, we work on reducing those costs over time, increasing volumes, and reducing those costs over time. But some of those products are more complex than the products we've had in the past, and so it's not practical to predict that it will actually get to the same level of margin and let’s say a simple product that we have.
Gary S. Guthart: Some improve quickly in margin and some take greater investment and longer time.
David R. Lewis – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Next, we will go to the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho W. Peterson – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good afternoon. Question maybe first one on dVP, your sequential performance, it was a little bit better than we have been modeling. I know you're somewhat reluctant to the kind of call it bottom here, but can you talk about whether there is any change in your own expectation from kind of a peak to trough drop-off in dVP, and is it too early to start to think about some of those that have dropped out coming back in for surgery?
Gary S. Guthart: Yeah, I think as you started out in your question. I think you accurately stated the way we feel about it. It is too early for us to call 90 days have passed since the last time we talked and we watched a little closer, where we’ve seen a favorable Q4 recognizing the Q3 as historically a seasonally slower quarter. And so I think trying to draw too many conclusions at this stage is probably not in anyone's best interest. So I can say that we didn't see a great deal of difference other than the numbers in terms of the discussions with the physicians, I think people are pretty much in the same place today as they were in Q3, however the numbers have shown an improvement, and we will watch it and we’ll see when we feel safe to call it a drop.
Tycho W. Peterson – JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then in terms of the quarter, in terms of placements, were you able to call out the impact of DA order at all, we had to keep watching about that.
Gary S. Guthart: So the DA contract was for about $34 million of products that was a contract for both systems initial stocking of instruments and accessories as well as other things that go with like simulators. And we did ship majority of what was under that contract in the last quarter.
Tycho W. Peterson – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just last one as we think about full ramp of the stapler here. I know you’re kind of still in the trailing period in working with [KOLs], but when should we think about that moving into kind of full commercial launch.
Aleks Cukic:  We’ll be advancing it carefully the first half of this year and likely through the full year, so in the first half, we expected the customers in this first quarter, and will advance as slowly as we get the customer feedback and really make sure that we’ve optimized their experience. So this will be a conservative launch, really focused on the fact that, stick when you sell, and we want to make sure that our customer is having great experiences.
Tycho W. Peterson – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Next, we’ll go to the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Lawrence S. Keusch – Raymond James Financial:  Thanks. Also maybe you can talk a little bit about prostrate and the experience in Europe, I guess there had been some concern that some of the changes in the U.S. here would have a pronounced effect over there, so any thoughts on that would be great.
Aleks Cukic: Well, I think as we’ve said in the past, the world is getting smaller, information is shared quickly and narrow our same senses if you will of participants at both national and international meeting. So I think there is some effect and it is in some markets, it’s probably felt a little bit more than in others. In other words, in a place like Japan where you’re starting relatively new, there is a lot of growth ahead of us and you’re probably powering through that, any concerns – if there were some concerns about whether or not, PSA screening is appropriate or conserve the treatment, whereas in other countries it’s probably a little bit more pronounced. So I don’t know that we can necessarily label Europe homogenously and believe more international for that matter and believe that it’s something that resembles – each country resembles the next, but I think there are probably some markets where it’s a little bit more pronounced than others.
Gary S. Guthart: Like in the U.S. it’s a hard think to model.
Lawrence S. Keusch – Raymond James Financial: Got it and then just two other quick ones, just relative to the 510 clearance that you guys are anticipating for Firefly in biliary, could you talk about how important that is to proceed the option of Single-Site Chole. It seems to me that obviously we can reduce kind of bile duct injuries that would be a positive with that technology. And then separately, I think last quarter you provided some feel for kind of in the U.S. what procedures grew if you were to adjust for the declines in prostatectomy. I was wondering if you can help us with that in the fourth quarter. 
Gary S. Guthart: Just speaking to the first one, the 510(k) submission for Firefly biliary imaging that has just been submitted this quarter, so in terms of when we expect clearance, no end point to tell you about yet. We do think that biliary imaging in real time is interesting and meaningful for Cholecystectomy for the reason that you indicated that a common bile duct injury is a serious complication, and we think that Firefly can augment the white light imaging and be a complement to cholangiography, so that’s the intend. We‘ve just started that conversation with FDA and as it proceeds in we have something more material to share we will. With regard to the break outs on kind of the adjustments and the procedure mix, I’ll turn to Aleks.
Aleks Cukic: Yeah, I think it’s pretty consistent with what I had mentioned earlier in terms of Hysterectomy, if cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery, endometriosis resection, partial nephrectomy, I mean those procedures are the ones that I think primarily are the strength for the quarter and for the year.
Gary S. Guthart: Yeah. And just looking at the numbers on a full-year basis, dVP on a full-year basis was down 15%, as Aleks described in his notes, if you kind of back that out in the U.S. everything else was up about 39%.
Lawrence S. Keusch – Raymond James Financial: Thank you so much.
Operator: We’ll go to the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
David H. Roman – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good evening everyone. And I’m certainly echoing the comments earlier on the very strong quarter here. So congrats, nice way to start - end the year and start 2013. I wanted to sort of focus a little bit on the general surgery application and more specifically, can you give some perspective on where the procedures you’re doing are coming from, and I guess what I’m asking is, are these procedures that were done in a laparoscopic setting, were they done open, are these people who wouldn’t otherwise do their procedures, are you adding growth to the market, maybe just any perspective you can give us on the competitive modalities would be helpful?
Aleks Cukic: Yeah. I think if you look at again, we believe, we talked about 42,000 procedures, up from 15,000 in 2011. If you look at the biggest contributor there it’s cholecystectomy. And almost all of those procedures had been done laparoscopically, because the standard of care is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. So that one I think is fairly simple to say where it’s coming from. If you look at bowel surgery and specifically large bowel or colon, you have left colons. You - starting the other side you have right colon is transverse, left sigmoid moving down into the rectum and then you have total colectomy. depending on which procedure each of those are accounted as a different procedure, depending on which of those procedures you’re talking about, if you did it inversely and you started at the most difficult or the lowest penetrated laparoscopically it would be low rectal cancer. There you are talking about data which suggest that it’s single digit penetration of laparoscopy whereas if you’re talking about right colon, it’s double digit and I have seen numbers perhaps as high as 20% or 21% or 22%, that is laparoscopic. So you have a range of where those patients would have gone either to a open surgery or laparoscopic surgery and then you have a smattering of procedures that range from some open, that would have been done open, whether it would be distal pancreatectomy or liver surgery and then you have other procedures such as Nissens that may have been laparoscopically. So there is a lot of movement that’s going on which is I think was an earlier question that Ben had asked about general surgery, you have what amounts to I think 40 some procedures that have been done and trying to build an individual profile for general surgery is a challenge.
David H. Roman – Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then maybe just a follow up on the guidances obviously 20% or 22% procedure guidance is a sold number. I mean look at that in contrasted with a total revenue guidance, it does imply a fairly sharp slowing on the system side of the business. Is there anything particular to call out there, is it comps, is it lapping the Japan reimbursement or anything to help us understand why that business would start – would slow to the degree that the guidance implies.
Calvin Darling: Yeah, I am not sure that – yeah the conclusion is absolutely right. I mean there are lot of factors in the guidance including the average selling prices of the systems and the procedures and so on, so yeah. So don’t necessarily agree with the conclusion. 
Marshall L. Mohr:  I think we’ve lived in a good world of – a good mix on systems. And so I’m not sure that we believe that that system mix in that ASP will hold for the whole year. I think on the I&A front, as we move out in time as we’ve always said, as stocking orders will become a smaller part of the picture and have less impact. And so, we would see some level of pressure on pricing on I&A. and then I think in general, I think we’ve shown over the years, the procedure growth outpaces revenue growth, because our systems generally are not at the same level.
David H. Roman – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then lastly, just to clarify on the share count, you said 41.2 million shares. is that a comment regarding the first quarter or the full-year of 2013?
Gary S. Guthart: That’s the first quarter comment.
David H. Roman – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it, thank you.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Rick Wise with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Rick A. Wise – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon everybody.
Gary S. Guthart: Hi, Rick.
Rick A. Wise – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: If you could just give us a little more color on some of the structural changes you’re making in Europe. Gary, you indicated that you’re making significant progress as you’ve deepened the organization. just a couple of things, how long do you envision this investment, maybe extraordinary investment process continuing and maybe, give us a little more details about some of the specific actions, if you could that you’re taking place and maybe how you’re approaching the market or Pan-Europe or company specific, anything to just to understand a little better, some of the things that are happening there? Thank you.
Gary S. Guthart:  Yeah. I think with regard to the progress we’ve made, I think we’ve made some progress, I’m not ready to call it significant progress yet. I think that our investments have really been in kind of three areas; one has been getting the right sales reps in the right territories, pretty straight forward. We’ve done that and we’ll continue to do so. And that runs on a set of coverage metrics and kind of market analyses that are pretty straight-forward. We’ve been making some more targeted investments, this isn’t [cash of thousands] [ph] spent in terms of understanding reimbursement and regulatory and the resources that are required to perform in different markets. And so that’s been a more targeted set of investments. and we’ve invested in some better kind of top line leadership, and I think investments in all three of those are encouraging, but they’re early. I think that we’ll continue to invest for the next several quarters. It isn’t a huge dollar value investments, they’re more targeted in that way, but they’re important. and so far I think that that we’ve made the right first steps, I think we need to continue on that pathway.
Rick A. Wise – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And thank you for that, and you think that the major thrust is completed this year or by midyear just getting any sense of timing?
Gary S. Guthart: I think we’ll be concentrating on it through the year and by this time, next year; we don’t ask that same set of questions.
Rick A. Wise – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Gary S. Guthart: Just time for one more question, if you will.
Rick A. Wise – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Japan, just again, I think you said a significant demand, with the da Vinci Si approval on hand, is this going to be an incremental driver or we’re going to see more upgrades maybe in 2013, getting help or bring that for us? Thank you.
Gary S. Guthart: I think there are really two things to say with regard to Si approval in Japan. The first one is we’re excited about the approval in large part, because it allows us to bring the Japan with follow-on clearances, a set of technologies that we think have really made a down set in the rest of the world and things like Single-Site and Firefly and thus assuming to counsel and simulate or a bunch of things that we invest on the SI system side. So we’re excited about that. I think structurally though in the longer term, the Japanese market penetration will be based by additional procedure reimbursement and so near-term it’s a great thing to get in the hands of Japanese customer. We need to continue to work on reimbursements beyond Prostatectomy and we will continue to do so. 
Rick A. Wise – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you so much.
Gary S. Guthart: Thank you. That was our last question. As we’ve said previously, while we focus on financial metrics, such as revenues and profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value and by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience from Warne in California gives you some sense what this means in the lives of our patients. “Last year I made a donation to the Sutter Maternity & Surgery Center. I had no idea that some day I might benefit by the use of this system. Having ontological engineering background, I am interested in innovations that benefit people. I consider this system to be a must have tool for our surgical centers. A few months ago after successive urine samples show traces of blood, my nurse practitioner asked me to see a urologist. Dr. Joe Franks discovered a small cancer in my bladder which I removed on May 8, 2012. A follow up CT scan on May 25, showed a tumor in my left kidney, because I am 88, I was considered borderline for surgery and if the mass appeared to be stable, I might be lucky enough to outlive the tumor. This was not to be, by late July, I was passing visible blood in my urine. On August 1, Dr. Franks agreed we should go ahead with surgery if my internist gave the okay. On Friday, August 30, internist pronounced me to be fit and I was on the list for surgery. On Saturday, Dr. Franks called me to say there was a surgery cancellation for that Monday morning, August 6.
 : Patients like Warne are the strongest applicants for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving about a few things that truly make the difference. This concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q3 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. And at this time, we would like to turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Director of Finance Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead, sir.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's Third Quarter Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Intuitive's archives on the Audio Archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter's results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, then I'll provide an update to our financial forecast for 2012. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary S. Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. The third quarter highlighted both market's strengths and headwinds. Our procedure performance came in below our expectations, driven by challenging conditions in Europe and changes in prostate cancer detection and treatment. On the positive side, acceptance of da Vinci surgery in general and gynecologic surgery continues to grow, in complex cancer procedures, benign procedures and in single port robotic surgery. In the third quarter, procedure growth was challenged by a continuing weakness in Europe and acceleration in the decline of our U.S. da Vinci prostatectomies. The prostatectomy decline appears to be driven by a combination of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation against PSA testing and a change in treatment recommendations for low-risk prostate cancer away from definitive treatment. European procedure weakness appears to be driven by 3 underlying conditions: broad economic pressure in Europe, sentiment behind the PSA testing recommendation from the U.S. reflecting into Europe and the need for increased depth in our commercial organization. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we expect economic pressure in Europe to persist for the near future. We have been investing in our European commercial organization over the past couple of quarters and anticipate doing so for the next several. Moving to general surgery. We experienced continued strong growth, which was multifaceted, including growth in colon and rectal surgery for cancers, as well as cholecystectomy, the latter following the introduction of Single-Site earlier in the year. Gynecology performance was solid. And like general surgery, gynecology was broad based, including hysterectomy, sacrocolpopexy and myomectomy. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. In Japan, system sales and procedure performance have both continued to growth, led by dVP. Two da Vinci training centers have opened this year, one at Fujita Health and one at Tokyo Medical University, to increase in-country capacity for training Japanese surgeons. Turning to our operating performance for the third quarter. We sold 155 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 133 during the third quarter of last year. Procedures grew approximately 22% over the third quarter of 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue was $218 million, up 24% over Q3 2011. Total revenue was $538 million, up 20% over last year. Total recurring revenue grew to $306 million, up 24% from prior year and comprising 57% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $259 million before noncash stock option expense, up 21% from the third quarter of last year and representing 48% of Q3 revenue. Net income was $183 million, up 50% over last year. We ended the quarter with $2,701,000,000 in cash and investments, up $70 million from last quarter. Turning to recently launched products and those in development. In the third quarter, we continue to focus on our launches of Single-Site for cholecystectomy and Vessel Sealer. This quarter, we submitted our 510(k) for Single-Site instruments and indications for use in benign hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy. We have received FDA's questions and are encouraged by the conversation for this expansion of Single-Site. We will work over the next few months to gather the data they have requested. We mentioned on our last call that we expect applications for the da Vinci Vessel Sealer to be centered on general surgery and gynecologic procedures. Uptake in customer response for the Vessel Sealer has been positive in both of these disciplines. Lastly, with regard to our da Vinci stapler, we have submitted our responses to FDA and believe that we have answered their questions. We are awaiting their response. As we enter new surgical markets and drive into new product arenas, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and in acquiring technology that can make a difference to robotic surgery. Given the uptick of da Vinci in general surgery, we expect to increase our sales force for emerging general surgery procedures and to increase customer training capacity. Furthermore, we plan to continue investment in our sales and marketing team in Europe and our overall organization in Japan. This quarter, we added 92 people to our team predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 2,192 employees. I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall L. Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our third quarter revenue was $538 million, up 20% compared with $447 million for the third quarter of 2011 and up slightly compared to the $536 million last quarter. Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $218 million, up 24% compared with $176 million for the third quarter of 2011 and down 3% compared with $224 million in the second quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase in I&A was driven by procedure growth of approximately 22% in sales of our new instrument and accessory products, including Single-Site, Vessel Sealer and Firefly. The year-over-year procedure growth was led by U.S. gynecologic procedures and U.S. general surgery growth, partially offset by lower growth in Europe and a decrease in U.S. dVPs. Third quarter 2012 U.S. dVP procedures decreased 20% compared to the prior year. The decrease in I&A revenue compared to last quarter was primarily driven by the timing of stocking and distributor orders. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,980 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,950 realized in the third quarter of 2011, though lower than the $2,020 realized in the second quarter of 2012. The sequential decrease was driven by the timing of instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with new system sales and the timing of distributor orders. Third quarter 2012 systems revenue of $232 million increased 17% compared with $199 million for the third quarter of 2011 and increased 1% compared with $229 million for the second quarter of 2012. We sold 155 systems in the third quarter of 2012 compared with 133 systems in the third quarter of 2011 and 150 systems in the second quarter of 2012. Our third quarter average sales price per system was $1.48 million, an increase from the $1.46 million realized in the third quarter of 2011 and a decrease compared to the $1.53 million realized in the second quarter. ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators and Firefly when configured with the system and exclude upgrades. The decrease in ASPs compared with the second quarter of 2012 was driven by a lower proportion of dual console and simulator configurations and lower revenue recognized on euro-denominated sales. We sold 87 simulators during the quarter, mostly in conjunction with new system sales compared with 121 last quarter. We sold 20 dual console systems compared to 28 in the second quarter. 34 of our third quarter 2012 system sales involved trade-ins comprised of 26 of da Vinci Ss and 8 Standard models. 35 of our second quarter 2012 system sales involved trade-ins comprised of 23 da Vinci Ss and 12 Standard models. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix, as well as foreign exchange rates on direct sales to foreign customers. Service revenue increased to $88 million, up 22% compared with $72 million last year and up 5% compared with $83 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base. Total third quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to $306 million, up 24% compared with the third quarter of 2011 and roughly equal to the second quarter of 2012. Recurring revenue represented 57% of total third quarter revenue compared with 55% in the third quarter last year and 57% last quarter. International results were as follows. Third quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $115 million, up 22% compared with revenue of $94 million in the third quarter of 2011 and up 14% compared with revenue of $101 million in the second quarter of 2012. Our international revenue growth was primarily driven by higher system sales into Japan. 16 da Vinci S Systems were sold into Japan during the third quarter of 2012 compared to 6 during the third quarter of 2011 and 7 during the second quarter of 2012. International instrument and accessory revenue grew approximately 9% year-over-year and decreased 17% sequentially. The changes in instrument and accessory revenue roughly followed the procedure volumes and reflect summer seasonality, a difficult European economic environment and distributor buying patterns. We sold 41 systems outside the United States compared with 34 in the third quarter of 2011 and 26 last quarter, reflecting higher Japanese placements. We sold 13 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 18 in the third quarter of 2011 and 13 last quarter. The decline in year-over-year European system sales reflects the difficult macroeconomic environment. Aleks will provide additional details of international system sales. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter was 72.5% compared with 72.9% during the third quarter of 2011 and 72% last quarter. Our slightly higher gross margin percentage compared to last quarter resulted primarily from cost improvements made to our new products. Third quarter 2012 operating expenses of $179 million were up 22% compared with the third quarter of 2011 and up 11% compared with the second quarter of 2012. Our higher third quarter 2012 operating expenses resulted in a large part from the timing of noncash stock option expenses. Beginning in 2012, we changed our stock option granting pattern so that employees are now granted options at both February 15 and August 15 compared with only at February 15 in prior years. Although approximately the same number of options were granted in each year, we recognized a higher proportion of stock option expense in the third quarter of 2012 relative to the first 2 quarters of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011. On a year-to-date basis, the stock option expense in 2012 is comparable to 2011. Our higher third quarter 2012 operating expenses also reflect higher R&D project expenses and increased headcount. We added 92 employees in the quarter, including 44 employees in our commercial operations and 36 employees in product operations. Third quarter 2012 operating income was $211 million or 39% of sales compared with $179 million or 40% of sales for the third quarter of 2011 and $225 million or 42% of sales for the second quarter of 2012. Third quarter 2012 operating income reflected $47 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $35 million for the third quarter of 2011 and $33 million last quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 15% compared with 32% for the third quarter of 2011 and 32% last quarter. Our lower third quarter tax rate resulted from the release of reserves specific to tax years where the statute of limitations has now expired and adjustments to our 2011 provision as we have now finalized and filed the related returns. Excluding onetime benefits, our third quarter tax provision would have been approximately $38 million higher. Our net income was $183 million or $4.46 per share compared with $122 million or $3.05 per share for the third quarter of 2011 and $155 million or $3.75 per share for the third quarter of -- for the second quarter of 2012. Excluding the onetime tax benefits, our third quarter net income would have been $145 million or $3.54 per share. Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 9 months of 2012. Procedures grew by 25%. Total revenue was $1,570,000,000, up 25% compared with $1,261,000,000 last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 27% and an increase in systems revenue of 21%. Year-to-date operating income was $630 million, up 27% compared with $495 million last year. Operating income included $115 million of stock-based compensation charges compared with $102 million in 2011. Net income was $482 million or $11.72 per share compared with $344 million or $8.55 per share last year. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $597 million compared with $464 million last year. Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and investments of $2.7 billion, up $70 million compared with June 30, 2012. The increase was driven by $246 million of cash flows from operations plus $38 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $170 million in stock buybacks and $17 million of capital and IP purchases. We bought back 343,000 shares at an average price of $495 per share, and we have $383 million board-authorized buybacks remaining. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the third quarter, we sold 155 da Vinci systems, 114 in the United States, 13 into Europe and 28 into rest of world markets. As part of the 155 system sales, 8 Standard da Vinci systems and 26 da Vinci S Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 121 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2,462 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 1,789 in the U.S., 400 in Europe and 273 in rest of world markets. 79 of the 155 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 139 of the 155 systems sold represented da Vinci Si or Si-e Systems, which included 20 dual console systems. The 41 system sales internationally included 16 into Japan, 4 into Australia and 3 into Belgium. The 16 systems placed in Japan establishes it as our second largest da Vinci market worldwide with 70 placements. With the exception of Europe, our da Vinci system performance remained very solid. Clinically, we do not meet our procedure expectations for the quarter, achieving year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 22%. The shortfall can be attributed to 2 factors: a larger-than-expected decline in our U.S. dVP business and procedure underperformance in Europe. The pressure we face within our U.S. dVP business can be traced to both conservative PSA screening protocols and a change in treatment recommendations for low-risk cancer patients away from definitive treatment. Our EU procedure business shortfall is a bit more complex to define as it appears to be both macroeconomic and structural in nature, as Gary stated. With the exception of these 2 areas, procedure performance was solid. Growth during the quarter was led by the categories of general surgery and GYN. Procedures, which included da Vinci Hysterectomy, Cholecystectomy, Colon and Rectal Resections, Lobectomy, Endometriosis Resections, Sacrocolpopexies, Myomectomy, Mitral Valve Repair and Nephrectomy all displayed solid growth. Recently released new products continue to do well, most notably Single-Site. Early customer feedback has been positive, and our initial sales have been strong. Clinical awareness for da Vinci Single-Site Cholecystectomy was very apparent at the recent American College of Surgery conference held in Chicago, the clinical presentations that were delivered drew large audiences with both U.S. and international surgeons participating. Through the third quarter, we sold Single-Site instrument and accessory kits to over 350 U.S. customers. Our recently launched Vessel Sealer product was also favorably received at this conference with most of the interest coming from colorectal and advanced general surgery clinicians. This product is performing well in the field, and the feature set, specifically the articulated risk design, appears to be satisfying a strong market need. The customer adoption for both da Vinci Simulator and Firefly continues to expand with 87 customers purchasing a da Vinci Simulator and 64 customers purchasing Firefly systems as part of their initial system purchases this quarter. During the quarter, several hundred robotic abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer-reviewed journals, while quarterly conferences produced several live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. Much of our early general surgery success has been within procedures that are deemed difficult to perform. Near the top of that category is low rectal cancer surgery. In recent edition of the Annals of Surgery, a prospective study entitled Impact of Robotic Surgery on Sexual and Urinary Functions After Fully Robotic Nerve-Sparing Total Mesorectal Excision for Rectal Cancer described the results of 74 da Vinci Rectal Resections completed at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy. Urinary and sexual functions are recognized as -- dysfunctions, excuse me, are recognized as serious complications within rectal surgery but have yet to be reported on robotically, which was the aim of the study. 74 patients undergoing fully robotic resection for rectal cancer were prospectively included in the study. Urinary and sexual dysfunctions affecting quality of life were assessed with specific self-administered questionnaires in all patients undergoing robotic total mesorectal excision, and the results were calculated using validated scoring systems and statistically analyzed. The analysis showed that the sexual function and general sexual satisfaction initially decreased 1 month post surgery for erectile function and general satisfaction in men and for arousal and general satisfaction, respectively, in women. Subsequent testing showed that both parameters increased progressively. And at 12 months post surgery, the values were comparable to presurgical baselines. Concerning urinary function, the grade of incontinence measured 1 year after intervention was consistent to presurgical measurements in both sexes. The study conclusion was, and I quote, "Robotic total mesorectal excision allows for preservation of urinary and sexual functions." The authors went on to say that this is most likely due to their ability to perform superior wristed movements, fine dissection, coupled with a stable magnified 3D view when working around the inferior hypogastric plexus. Consistent with the theme of difficult to perform general surgical procedures is a paper out of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center, which recently published in the Annals of Surgery. The paper entitled Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Distal Pancreatectomy is Superior to Laparoscopic Technique described the technical limitations of the laparoscopic approach and how it may limit patient eligibility and require conversion to open or hand-assisted surgery to maintain patient safety. The study compared the perioperative outcomes, 90-day morbidity and mortality of their first 30 robotic distal pancreatectomies to a historical control of 94 consecutive laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies. They reported that the postoperative length of hospital stay and rates of pancreatic fistula blood transfusions and readmissions were not statistically different between the groups. However, for patients in the robotic group, the conversion rate to open surgery was 0 as compared to the lap group of 16%, which significantly reduced the risk of excessive blood loss. Also of note was that more pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas were approached robotically than laparoscopically, 43% compared to 15%. Oncologic outcomes in these cases were superior for the robotic-assisted group with higher rates of margin negative resection and improved lymph node yields for both benign and malignant lesions. The author's conclusion, and I quote, “Robotic distal pancreatectomies were equivalent to laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies in nearly all measurements of outcome and safety but significantly reduced the risk of conversion to open resection despite a statistically greater probability of malignancy in the robotic cohort. We concluded that robotic assistance may broaden indications for minimally invasive pancreatectomy." From time to time, we will read critical reviews relating to the cost of robotic surgery where the underlying comparator is usually laparoscopic or laparoscopically assisted surgery. Some comparisons have lumped several procedures into the same analysis, labeling them all as robotic, while others have looked at each procedure individually. While it would be presumptuous to dismiss all previous analysis as incorrect, it would be accurate to point out that every procedure has its own economic profile and can only be compared accordingly. In a recent edition of the Journal of Endourology, a study entitled Cost Analysis of Robotic-Assisted Versus Hand-Assisted Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy reviewed the economics for one of our largest and most successful procedures, partial nephrectomy. The aim of the study was to perform a cost comparison of 3 approaches to partial nephrectomy, those being open, partial nephrectomy, hand-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and robotic partial nephrectomy. The retrospective analysis evaluated cost and clinical data from 89 patients who had undergone the 3 surgical approaches. Baseline demographic data, patient comorbidities, nephrometry score and perioperative outcomes were assessed. Costs and subcosts from the operating room and hospital were evaluated using nonparametric statistical analysis. Since the patient comorbidities and tumor characteristics were different in the open partial nephrectomy cohort, it was excluded from the cost comparison, thus allowing for an apples-to-apples comparison between hand-assist laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and robotic partial nephrectomy. The study found no difference in overall costs between hand-assist and robotic partial nephrectomy. OR costs were higher for the robotic partial nephrectomy because of the higher robotic capital and reusable equipment cost that outweighed the cost of disposable product for the hand-assist laparoscopic partial nephrectomy group. OR time-related costs were similar between the groups. Robotic partial nephrectomy patients had a shorter length of stay, which decreased postoperative hospital costs. They concluded by saying, and I quote, "No difference in overall cost was found between robotic partial nephrectomy and hand-assist laparoscopic partial nephrectomies. Robot allocation, OR equipment used and length of stay are important determinants of total cost. Further study regarding recovery and quality of life may reveal added benefits to minimally invasive approach and increased use in nephron-sparing surgery." This concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the time over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2012, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast procedures to grow approximately 25% to 27% from the base of approximately 360,000 procedures performed in 2011. Three quarters through 2012, our procedure growth stands at approximately 25%. During the third quarter, we saw further pressure on our U.S. dVP both volumes and upon our overall European procedure business. As a result, we now forecast full year 2012 da Vinci procedure volume to grow approximately 24% above our 2011 total. Moving on to revenues. On our last call, we forecast 2012 revenues to grow between 20% and 23% above our 2011 revenue of $1.76 billion. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are now able to refine our guidance to the upper half of this range. Now turning to noncash expenses. We continue to expect noncash stock compensation to fall within a range of between $152 million and $156 million for the year. Through 3 quarters of this year, $115 million of stock compensation has been recognized, and all of the quarterly timing differences related to our revised 2012 employee grant process have cycled through. The Q4 portion of total 2012 option expense should follow historical patterns. Now turning to other income. On our last call -- operating income. On our last call, we forecast operating income to fall within a range of between 39% and 40% of net revenue. Now based upon the impact of recent material cost reductions and expense timing, we expect operating income to come in at the high end of the range at about 40% for the year. We continue to expect other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, to total between $16 million and $17 million for the year. With regard to income tax, our Q3 reported tax rate of 15% reflected a discrete benefit related to releasing reserves for tax years where the statutes of limitations had expired. This discrete item favorably impacted Q3 but will not impact Q4. We continue to expect the Q4 tax rate to be approximately 31% of pretax income, which has not assumed any reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Going forward into 2013, we expect to see a gradual reduction in rate to a range of between 29% and 31%. Also looking into 2013, the medical device tax is scheduled to become effective on January 1. Based upon our 2012 regional and product mix, we would estimate the tax to equate to roughly 1.1% of our net consolidated revenue. We would plan to record the expense as a component of cost of sales. We estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q4 2012 will be roughly flat to Q3 at approximately 41.1 million shares. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question in queue from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Gary or Aleks or anyone for that matter, just thinking about the third quarter kind of from the macro perspective, it looks like the third quarter is a lot like the second quarter. We saw significant Japan strength and U.S. de novo system strength offset by Europe, and we saw dVP U.S. and OUS weakness offset, obviously, by dVH, as well as some general surgery improvements. So do you have sort of any sense the fourth quarter guidance sort of implies stable trends on procedures with the third quarter? Do you have any sense of the balance of these positive and negative forces? How many quarters do you think this could persist?
Gary S. Guthart: It’s Gary. It's pretty hard to call U.S. prostatectomy. That's, as you know, more an issue of medical management and watchful waiting than it is a change in da Vinci Surgery versus other kinds of surgery. So we don't have a crystal ball as to where that procedure is going to go over time. The data we look at is probably pretty similar to the data that you look at in terms of where PSA testing is taking us. On the upside, I think the things that are growing, we can measure good interest from our customers. We can measure sales force activity that tends to be a little bit more on our camp versus out in the world. So on the downside, pretty tough to call. On the upside, we can look at the activities that we can influence and feel pretty confident about the things that we can do.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Gary, just following up on one of those key catalysts, which, obviously, is single incision. I don't know if I caught it on the call, but could you sort of confirm whether sales has sort of moved into your third largest procedure for the company?
Gary S. Guthart: We have talked about before that cholecystectomy has a total procedure of all types, multiport and single-site. Together, combined, is the third. Single port on its own is not.
Aleks Cukic: It's important to note that, as a reminder, of course, it's a distant third. I mean, you have hysterectomy, you have prostatectomy and you have cholecystectomy. And so you have other procedures that are sort of in the general neighborhood procedures such as a partial nephrectomy and sacrocolpopexy and others. So it is indeed third, but as a reminder, it is a distant third.
Gary S. Guthart: There's one more difference that's worth pointing out, is that unlike prostatectomy and hysterectomy, cholecystectomy can be an entry point into a clinical pathway for somebody who wants to end somewhere else. And so those procedures can be a little bit more volatile.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And then, Gary, just one quick one. I apologize for 2, 3 questions. But you talked about an increase in spending for both U.S. general surgery. And potentially, I would imagine if you're going to go after Europe and change structurally how you're selling that it could be increased expense. Could you help us sort of frame those relative expenses versus other very significant sales investments you've made, perhaps the 2010 significant investment in the U.S.?
Gary S. Guthart: This won't quite be the same scale. It's a little bit more targeted. So in Europe, it's really filling open headcount in the field and investing a little bit more in the back office in terms of clinical trials and other types of marketing investments, economic analyses and so on. So that's kind of what the European side looks like on the general surgery side. It will be general-surgery focused expertise and depth.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Gary, can you break down the procedure growth for us between the U.S., Europe and ROW?
Gary S. Guthart: I'll turn it to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Right. So the procedure growth -- let me find that. Go ahead.
Marshall L. Mohr: Total procedure growth quarter -- year-over-year was 22%. And then what we said was that the procedure growth outside of the U.S. year-over-year was 9%.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. So was the U.S. close to around 30%? It wouldn't be that high?
Calvin Darling: Yes, I mean, you could probably back into it on your models there. But again, worldwide, we're looking at about 22% for Q3, 25% on a year-to-date basis. And included in those numbers would be a decline in the U.S. dVP volume that Marshall mentioned of 20% on a quarter basis and 14% on a year-to-date basis. And so I think kind of what it implies is that if the U.S. stayed flat from year to year, the worldwide growth would have been about 26% in Q3 and 28% on a year-to-date basis.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Right. I guess what I'm getting at is dVP is down 20% in the U.S. If you were on a base of, say, 75,000 cases for '11, if that's down 20% full year, you're talking something in the low 60,000 cases, negative 15,000 at the most, 12,000 to 15,000. If dVH has grown 60,000 and chole is adding 10,000 and all the other stuff is adding another 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, you end up with robust procedure growth in the United States. And the real evidence of the problem is obviously Europe, which is macro, and some concern about, obviously, dVP. But at some point, dVP has to bottom. And so the question becomes, is there sort of a structural level of prostatectomy that we can think about where this will shake out over the course of, call it, 6, 8 quarters and we’ll end up at maybe a the rate of 50,000 dVPs in the U.S.? Does that make sense?
Gary S. Guthart: The flow of your argument makes sense. I think that Calvin may argue with you about some of the numbers. Just to make sure that you're tie them out right. But the flow, generally speaking, the flow makes sense. Calling that number of kind of what the baseline number of prostatectomies in the U.S. is hard to do. We've seen some analysis out there that's probably similar to the kinds of analysis that you've seen, and I think we're just going to have to see where that base establishes itself. I mean, I think there are a couple of things that argue for a base. One of them is that prostate cancer, the highest cure rate will come from surgery, not from medical management. And the other thing that we know is that over time, watchful waiting patients, some fraction of them, usually a majority of them, will convert to definitive treatment over time. So I think both of those things will argue for finding a floor, and what exactly that floor level is, we're just going to have to wait and see.
Aleks Cukic: Yes. But I think, Ben, the central theme of your thesis there is accurate. And that is if you look outside of those 2 areas, U.S. dVP and the European weakness, the remainder of the procedure business was very strong year-to-date and for the quarter.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And I'll sneak in one more as well, if you look at Japan, we've done some calls recently, and it sounds as though the Japanese government has authorized funding for about 150 systems. And our sources were sort of indicating that, that could come into play by the end of '13, and certainly 16 in the third quarter goes a long way towards that. Is that consistent with sustaining this sort of 16 or pretty substantial rate? And is that a reasonable target for an installed base kind of going out of '13?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes. I don't think we're ready to size the total market opportunity. And I think that system sales by themselves are going to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and I would expect some lumpiness. Long term, we're really excited about the Japanese market opportunity. The key opinion leaders, the people we talked to on the ground are excited about robotic surgery. And we think it will build, and that's another area of investment. But again, kind of calling the specifics is not something we're prepared to do.
Aleks Cukic: Yes, I think there's just one caveat that's worth mentioning, is as a reminder, we have one national reimbursement, which is prostatectomy. There are ways for it, as evidenced by the activities prior to that national reimbursement, that hospitals can go through that's, call them, a one-off basis or a checklist basis where they can apply for certain levels of reimbursement on other procedures. But from a national perspective, we are really in this environment where we are working within prostatectomy primarily. And then there may be a few other procedures that get worked in on a one-off basis. So that's the environment we're in for a little while.
Calvin Darling: Yes. The next scheduled pass, that procedure being added to the reimbursement list would be April of 2014 for a general system-wide reimbursement.
Gary S. Guthart: Based on the way that MHLW runs the review.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question maybe on chole, wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a breakdown as to how much of the chole uptake is single-site versus multi-arm. And are you starting to see chole drive system placements?
Calvin Darling: I think we're not prepared to break out what that mix is. And honestly, I think the important message here is that -- is to just really look at this structurally. You have general surgeons who don't have a lot of robotic experience going in. And so they are going to work through various procedures to some level to make sure that they have a good understanding of the Xs and Os of the system. And then what is today a general multiport cholecystectomy, the expectation is that those move in to single-site. So there will be a relationship, and I think trying to call it at any given time is probably -- I don't know how meaningful that is. But collectively, as we said, it is the third largest procedure. Now we -- I think the way we would categorize the importance of procedures as they relate to new system placements, it's hard to tease out what is cholecystectomy and what is general surgery because to Gary's earlier comments, sometimes cholecystectomy is not the endpoint which the general surgeons are trying to get to. And so it becomes one of many procedures that they see in our armamentarium over time. And so it's really hard to say what evidence we have at this point that it's chole specific that is driving the system. But there's definite evidence that general surgeons are becoming more and more important to system placements.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then in your commentary, you talked about additional indications for Single-Site, benign hysterectomy and nephrectomy, can you just talk about how you think about those opportunities and then how much you want to push through Single-Site versus -- at some point, is it logical to introduce a new system?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes. On the first side, we think that hysterectomy is a patient population that sets up well for a single port robotic approach. And we've gotten good feedback from customers in Europe and the U.S. that that’s something worth pursuing, and so that's been our next procedure, that and nephrectomy. We'll see in terms of what happens next after Single-Site. We'll continue to invest in instrumentation that makes sense in that platform and in indications. I don't think that will be the last stopping point in terms of an indication for Single-Site as we go forward. And as always, we continue to invest in technologies that can make things more capable, and we invest in tissue interaction technologies. We invest in patient access, smaller ports in different ways to get into the body. And with regard to Single-Site, we'll continue to do that.
Marshall L. Mohr: Yes. I think the way we think about, for example, the Single-Site in GYN or benign hysterectomy is if you think about the way we've always described the market, there is a level of complexity that was inherent in our target for hysterectomy, both benign, complex benign, as well as malignant. And so there's a subsegment of the market that is by definition, if you will, relatively less complex or simple. It seems like a very good area for us to apply some resources and see if this is indeed something we can access with new technology, which is the approach.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just one last one because I'm sure we'll all get the question. In terms of the stapler, I mean, based on your actions with FDA, are you still thinking this could come by year end? Or should we think about SAGES next year? Just how do we think about timing there?
Gary S. Guthart: It's always hard to predict exactly timing on these things, and so I won't -- we've had a healthy conversation with FDA. We've understood their questions. I think that we have provided answers that make sense, and we'll let you know what happens thereafter.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from the line of Lennox Ketner with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: First question, it sounds like you're seeing a lot of good momentum in Japan. I'm wondering if you could just comment on what Japan contributed to either overall procedure growth in the quarter or to the 9% international growth.
Gary S. Guthart: Just in a broad brush, it's growing nicely, out from a very small base. So in-country, we're delighted with the growth rate. In terms of total contribution to the overall, it's probably not a material contribution at this time.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then just to go back to Europe, Gary, you talked about the fact that it's partly the macro environment and partly structural, which it sounds like you're working to address on the structural issues. But I'm wondering if you could just give a little more detail on what those structural issues are. From my conversations with some European physicians, it sounds like 2 of the challenges over there are, one, that in some countries, there are per diem reimbursement systems. To me, it makes the length of stay reduction less valuable upfront, but then also, just the fact that there's less competition among hospitals. Are those kind of the 2 main structural issues? Or is there something I'm missing there that you guys are working to address?
Gary S. Guthart: I think there are a couple of things. One of the structural things is just open territories on our side and making sure we have the right number of salespeople in the various countries, and we can run that against internal metrics. So it's pretty simple one. And the solution there is to make sure that we're fully staffed. The second thing, or more along the lines you've discussed, although I described it a little bit differently. I think it is not really that a single-payer system is not capable or interested in adopting da Vinci Surgery. We've seen Japan single-payer system that's been moving pretty quickly. Sweden as a single-payer system has moved quickly. So it isn't the act of being a single payer. It's more of making sure that the conversations with government-run hospitals around both economy value and clinical data are put into forms that they can accept and we can match their time lines. You're absolutely right with regard to systems that are using per diem, but that's a real challenge for hospitals to adopt da Vinci Surgery. We see per diem systems being challenged in favor of DRGs in a lot of different places, not only for da Vinci. I think the trend is away from per diem, not towards it. And so I don't see that as systemic across all of Europe but really in pockets.
Operator: Our next questions in queue will come from line of Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Just to pick up on that question. Could you talk a little bit about perhaps where you are seeing some of the procedure pressures within Europe? Is it more directed at Southern Europe? And just really trying to get a sense of whether anything is changing out there.
Gary S. Guthart: You see capital pressure in Southern Europe, absolutely. Procedure pressure is a little bit less targeted directly with Southern versus Northern, and so it moves around a little bit.
Marshall L. Mohr: So if you looked at -- and again, I think it almost takes even a little, perhaps, a derivative deeper. So if you looked at environments like public hospitals in France, let's say, versus clinics in France and/or private clinics in other parts of Europe, it becomes, probably, more akin to those comparisons than it does just individual countries. And we've had strength in Germany over -- not this particular quarter, but in the past 2 years, we've called out Germany as having a lot of strength. This is the first time we've called out Belgium in probably a few -- probably 1.5 years. So it seems like it's rotating through various countries, but it's probably more consistent with the public versus private.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And just 2 other quick ones. As you noted, benign hysterectomy and oophorectomy for Single-Site, how dependent -- in getting into those procedures, how dependent then is it on the need for new instrumentation? And if so, what might be the timing on that? And then lastly, you utilized cash this quarter to buy back stock. You still have a lot. So again, if you could just remind us of the general uses of cash.
Gary S. Guthart: On the issue of Single-Site, as we've said before, we've just submitted and received our first round of questions from FDA on the extension of our indications for Single-Site into hysterectomy and oophorectomy. I think there that we have, as you know, good momentum in hysterectomy, I think it goes into a set of surgeons who are interested in robotic surgery and towards the segment of the patient population that would be interested in [indiscernible] and return to full function. So we're excited about that. I think it will make some sense. We're in the early stages of our interactions with FDA. How long that will take, it's very tough to predict, and so we won't.
Marshall L. Mohr: Yes. As far as the instruments, Larry, I would say the -- which is pretty consistent with the way we've approached new markets and new procedure targets, where we have a good base of instruments, but we're not exactly optimized for perfect performance, if you will, in terms of ease of use and having all of the right instruments. But think of it in terms of adding a few instruments rather than creating a whole new category of instruments. And I think that will be -- that's been consistent and will be consistent as we go into new procedure targets.
Gary S. Guthart: With regard to uses of cash, I'll turn that to Marshall.
Marshall L. Mohr: Yes. So we bought back 343,000 shares this quarter. We have 383 million still authorized by the board. We'll continue to program. We'll buy back stock when it makes sense. It's not a absolutely certain amount every day. Beyond that, the cash is there for investment back into the business over time, particularly if there were to be an extended or deepened economic issue on a macro basis, as well as for investment into IP if the opportunities come up.
Gary S. Guthart: Or other technologies.
Marshall L. Mohr: Yes.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.
David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was hoping if I could focus a little bit on the spending side of the equation. Obviously, you had guided to the $20 million sequential uptick this quarter versus the second quarter. But if I just look to the income statement, SG&A still being down as a percentage of sales year-over-year. So if you take out of the options grant this quarter, can you maybe talk about your spending priorities? It sounds like you have a lot on deck here in terms of investing in new procedure categories, trying to fend off the assault on dVP, rebuilding your Europe presence, yet SG&A is still growing slower than revenue. That's -- and then I have a follow-up.
Marshall L. Mohr: Yes. We'll talk just on the numbers side, and I'll hand it over. We've guided towards about $20 million increase in operating expenses quarter-to-quarter. It came in closer to $17.5 million. So a little bit less than that. And I think it had a little bit to do with the timing here. We called out R&D projects last quarter. Some of those you're going to see probably spilling into future quarters. And then I think the timing on SG&A that you alluded to, David, we're starting on some things that we thought we might be -- it might have been a little further along here in Q3 in terms of building the organization and the training capacities and so on. So in terms of the numbers, that, I think, the grow -- you're going to see some growth in the OpEx going forward into Q4, and that's inherent in the 40% operating income guidance we gave.
Gary S. Guthart: I think we've laid out for you the things that we think are deserving of differential or additional investment. We've typically been thoughtful about how we invest. And we don't trend to mad dash one direction or another. And so we'll be building it out, but we'll build it out against the plan.
David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then Japan, which has obviously been very successful for you particularly since you got the reimbursement in April, can we maybe talk about the sustainability of that business you referenced, I think, in your prepared remarks that there is some spillover of the dVP concerns of the U.S. into Europe? And obviously, Japan has had a much more nascent stage in its ramp, so you probably wouldn't have seen it at this point. But any concerns on that transpiring Japan? And how we should think about growth in that business over the next 12 months or so?
Gary S. Guthart: On the dVP side, actually the uptick has been significant in terms of dVP in Japan relative to the number of prostatectomies that they do. We do dominate it in prostatectomies based on what they've been doing there. We haven't heard a reflection of this set of concerns into Japan. It's not to say that it might not happen in the future, it might. In general, I think that Japanese surgeons have expressed interest in da Vinci for a pretty broad variety of procedures. So even where that's to be pressured over time, I don't know that it would dampen enthusiasm for a long period for other procedures as we go. Quarter-to-quarter performance can be lumpy there.
David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Sure. And then maybe just one really quick clarification question. From an EPS perspective, this quarter, the $4.46 you reported includes the tax benefit that you discussed. Are you pointing people toward the non-GAAP number or the GAAP $4.46 in terms of the ongoing earnings number for the quarter?
Marshall L. Mohr: So we give you the $4.46, which is the GAAP number. But we also said that if you excluded that, we would have been at $3.54. So we're trying to provide you with all the information so that you can do your own comparisons.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from the line of Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: I wanted to come back to your comments on this sales with simulators, Firefly, dual consoles. It seemed like sequentially, those were down even though total da Vinci sales were up sequentially. Is there anything to read into that? Are some customers looking at more defeatured units? Or is that just a complete coincidence?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes, it's definitely trended down. I think on the Firefly side though, it's pretty similar. We've been saying about the last 3 quarters that about 1/2 of the U.S. systems have gone out with Firefly configuration, and that held through in Q3. As it relates to the dual console and the simulator, those kind of go together in some respects as they're, in large part, training tools and applications. And a slow downward trend there is something that we would have predicted internally here as maybe a fair number of sites have invested in these technologies for training. And then as you know, a lot of systems we sell now are to existing customers, and some of those existing customers already have simulators and dual consoles. So it's maybe less obvious value in those situations. So a little downward trend there is probably something we would expect, but very gradual.
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And quick follow-up on revenue per procedure. I heard the comments on timing of stocking and distributor orders. Is this a run rate that we should be expecting now going forward? Obviously, you've been trending up with a lot of the new instruments. But with a lot of those now in there, is this more of a comfortable run rate?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes. I mean, we've been seeing the run-up, as you say, in recent quarters due to the impact of the new products. And what we've been saying, there are a lot of factors that can serve to move that metric up or down. And in this particular quarter, as Marshall called out in his commentary, we saw some of the timing of those initial stocking orders with system sales and distributor orders kind of serve to drive it slightly down here. But I'd say going forward, it could go up or down, depending -- we also some of the product -- the procedure mix, right? So the more Single-Sites and benign hysterectomies have a lower revenue per procedure for us, kind of pushes it down. So again, I'd say going forward, it could probably go either way from where we are right now.
Calvin Darling: That was the last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. We hope the following experience from Susan of Ohio gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. "I was diagnosed in August of 2011 with adenocarcinoma. I'm a mom of 5, grandma of 11 and 52 years old. I quit smoking years ago. Wow, I had a lot to think about when, by God's grace, I was introduced to a super surgeon. At the time, he thought I would be a really great candidate for the da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery. I figured it sounded really great. We did the surgery in December of 2011. At first, when I started reading about it on websites and talking with people, it sounded really scary. But after reading testimonies like mine, I realized it was the only way to go. And so we removed the top lobe of my left lung in December of 2011. I was home in 2 days. The nurses at the hospital could not believe the type of surgery I'd had. Wow, how the robot changed my life. In no time, I was back to a normal life. My surgeon is one of the best around and I am living proof. He saved my life, saved me from a grueling recovery and saved me from a horrific scar. I had a few little holes and a small incision where they removed the lung. While they were in there, they took lymph nodes, which, by the way, are great. No cancer and a 20% chance that this cancer comes back. If you're considering this type of surgery, I urge you to really think positively about this. Just absolutely amazing what modern medicine is all about. I would welcome the chance to have the surgery versus the old-fashioned way. Recovery was 2 weeks, and I was back to work in 3. It's a miracle that they can do these things with a robot, but they do." Patients like these are our strongest advocates for da Vinci Surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q2 2012 Earnings Release Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director, Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to Intuitive Surgical's second quarter conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter's results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, and I will provide an update to our financial forecast for 2012. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary S. Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, our team has delivered a solid performance driven by robust growth in both our U.S. gynecology business and our emerging general surgery business. As a reminder, for 2012, Intuitive is focused on the following: First, continuing our growth in gynecology and urology worldwide through outstanding execution in the field; second, disciplined execution of our Single-Site and vessel sealing launches focused on outstanding early customer experiences; third, building robust clinical programs with leading customers in emerging procedures in general surgery, thoracic surgery and transoral surgery; and finally, strengthening our capabilities in international markets, particularly Europe, Japan and Korea. In the second quarter, we continued to experience strong growth in gynecology and general surgery. Growth in gynecology came from a broad base of procedures, including benign and cancer hysterectomies, sacrocolpopexy, myomectomy and endometriosis resection. Growth in general surgery was also multifaceted, including growth in colon and rectal surgery, as well as cholecystectomy. The latter following the introduction of Single-Site earlier in the year. This strength was tempered somewhat by weakness in Europe and a decline in our U.S. da Vinci Prostatectomies. In total, procedures for the second quarter 2012 grew by approximately 26% over the second quarter of 2011. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. Globally, our business in Asia has continued to build as a result of fine execution by our team. Japan's system sales and procedure performance have responded well to MHLW's reimbursement of da Vinci Prostatectomy at the start of the second quarter, and we continue to invest in building our capabilities in Japan. Conditions in Europe are challenging, with both broad austerity issues, as well as specific structural issues impacting our business. In response to these conditions, we have brought in an experienced executive from our key accounts group in the United States to lead our European commercial organization. We also continue to invest in our international regulatory and reimbursement teams. Given the depth of environmental issues in Europe, we expect challenging conditions to persist into the second half of the year. Turning to operating highlights for the second quarter. Procedures grew approximately 26% over the second quarter of 2011. We sold 150 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 129 during the second quarter of last year. Total revenue was $537 million, up 26% over last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $224 million, up 30% over Q2 2011. Total recurring revenue grew to $307 million, up 28% from prior year and comprising 57% of total revenue. Net income was $155 million, up 32% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $259 million before noncash stock option expense, up 27% from the second quarter of last year. We generated $223 million in gross cash flow from operations and ended the quarter with $2,631,000,000 in cash and investments. Turning to recently launched products and those in development. In the second quarter, we focused on launches of our Single-Site instruments and vessel sealer. We expanded the use of Single-Site cholecystectomy in the U.S. in response to growing early customer demand. Surgeon and patient response to Single-Site has been positive with over 200 of our U.S. hospital customers having purchased initial Single-Site kits 2 quarters after launch. As mentioned in prior calls, we are working on expanding our instrument offering in Single-Site to enable its use in additional indications. In our vessel sealing launch, we are optimizing procedure choreography through collaboration with leading surgeons, while firming up our manufacturing and supply chain. Clinical response to the vessel sealer has been encouraging, with positive commentary on precision, articulation, vessel sealing quality and thermal spread. We expect applications for the da Vinci vessel sealer to be centered on general surgery and Gynecologic Oncology procedures. Lastly, with regard to our da Vinci stapler, we are gathering data to respond to FDA questions and working on product optimization. As we enter new surgical markets and drive into new product arenas, we continue to invest in building our team. In expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies, they can make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter we added 82 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 2,100 employees. I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall L. Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our second quarter revenue was $537 million, up 26% compared with $426 million for the second quarter of 2011, and up 8% compared with $495 million reported for the first quarter of 2012. Second quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Second quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $224 million, up 30% compared with $172 million for the second quarter of 2011, and up 8% compared with $208 million in the first quarter of 2012. The increases in instruments and accessories were driven by procedure growth of approximately 26% and sales of our new instrument and accessory products, including Single-Site, vessel sealer and Firefly. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $2,015 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,940 realized in the second quarter of 2011 and the $1,985 realized in the first quarter of 2012. The increase in I&A per procedure was driven primarily by new product sales in advance of their use in cases. Second quarter 2012 systems revenue of $229 million increased 23% compared with $187 million for the second quarter of 2011, and increased 11% compared with $207 million for the first quarter of 2012. We sold 150 systems in the second quarter of 2012 compared with 129 systems in the second quarter of 2011 and 140 systems in the first quarter of 2012. Our second quarter average sales price per system was $1.53 million, an increase from the $1.44 million realized in the second quarter of 2011 and $1.47 million realized in the first quarter. ASPs include all da Vinci models, all simulators and Firefly when configured with the system and exclude upgrades. The increase in ASPs compared with the first quarter of 2012 was driven by favorable channel, product and trade-in mix. From a channel standpoint, we sold proportionally less systems to distributors, which are sold at lower prices than prices charged to direct customers. There were 14 systems sold to distributors in the second quarter compared with 26 in the first quarter. On the product side, we sold 121 simulators, mostly in conjunction with new system sales compared with 108 -- or 102 last quarter. We also sold 28 dual console systems compared to 25 in the first quarter. 35 of our second quarter 2012 systems involved trade-ins comprised of 23 da Vinci Ss and 12 standard models, while 46 of our first quarter 2012 system sales involved trade-ins, comprised of 27 da Vinci Ss and 19 standard models. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix, as well as foreign exchange rates on direct sales to foreign customers. We would expect systems ASPs to decline in future quarters driven by a return to a more historic mix and lower ASPs earned on direct sales to European customers due to lower euro exchange rate. Service revenue increased to $83 million, up 23% compared with $68 million last year and up 3% compared with $81 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total second quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $307 million, up 28% compared with the second quarter of 2011 and up 6% compared with the first quarter of 2012. Recurring revenue represented 57% of total second quarter revenue compared with 56% in the second quarter last year and 58% last quarter. International results were as follows. Second quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $101 million, up 16% compared with revenue of $87 million in the second quarter of 2011, and down 3% compared with revenue of $105 million in the first quarter of 2012. Instrument and accessory revenue grew approximately 21% year-over-year and decreased 3% sequentially, reflecting procedure growth rates. Procedures outside of the U.S. grew 21% on a year-to-year basis and decreased approximately 1% sequentially. The growth in procedures compared to the prior year primarily reflect dVP growth in Europe. The decline in procedures compared with the first quarter reflects the macroeconomic environment in Europe coupled with fewer operating days due to holidays. dVPs in Japan grew at a high rate, albeit off a small base, as national reimbursement was approved at the beginning of the quarter. We sold 26 systems outside the U.S. compared with 30 in the second quarter of 2011 and 35 last quarter. We sold 13 systems in Europe this quarter, with 16 in the second quarter of 2011 and 14 last quarter. And we sold 7 systems in Japan compared with 7 last quarter and 4 in the second quarter of last year. The decline in European system sales reflects difficult macroeconomic environment. Aleks will provide additional details of international system sales. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the second quarter was 72%, roughly equal to the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012. Our gross margin has remained unchanged as the positive impacts of our higher second quarter system ASPs were offset by lower margins earned on new products and higher inventory reserves. Margins on newly launched products would typically be lower than those for our mature products, reflecting vendor pricing on low volumes, temporary tooling costs and other startup costs. Overtime, as volumes increase, we refine the manufacturing process of some products, we should see improvements in the margins of these newer products. Second quarter 2012 operating expenses of $161.1 million were up 16% compared with the second quarter of 2011 and down 1% compared with the first quarter of 2012. We changed our stock option granting pattern this year, so that employees are granted options at both February 15 and August 15 compared with only at February 15 in prior years. Although approximately the same number of options will be granted annually, the amount of expense taken in the first quarter and second quarter was approximately $3 million and $5 million lower and the amount of expense in the third quarter will be approximately $8 million higher than had we not changed our stock granting pattern. We added 82 employees in the quarter, including 38 employees in our commercial operations and 39 employees in product operations. Second quarter operating income was $225 million or 42% of sales compared with $168 million or 39% of sales for the second quarter of 2011 and $193 million or 39% of sales for the first quarter of 2012. Second quarter 2012 operating income reflected $33 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $35 million for the second quarter of 2011 and $34 million last quarter. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 32% compared with 32% for the second quarter of 2011 and 27% last quarter. Our 32% second quarter rate was higher than our previous guidance of 31%, primarily due to a higher proportion of pretax income coming from our U.S. business. Our net income was $155 million or $3.75 per share compared with $117 million or $2.91 per share for the second quarter of 2011 and $144 million or $3.50 per share for the first quarter of 2012. Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 6 months of 2012. Procedures grew by 27%. Total revenue for the first 6 months of 2012 was $1,032,000,000, up 27% compared with $814 million last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 29% and an increase in systems revenue of 23%. Operating income for the first 6 months of 2012 was $419 million, up 32% compared with $316 million last year. Operating income included $68 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first 6 months of 2012 compared with $67 million in 2011. Net income for the first 6 months of 2012 was $298 million or $7.26 per share compared with $222 million or $5.51 per share last year. Cash flows from operations for the first 6 months of 2012 was $383 million compared with $306 million last year. Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and investments of $2.6 billion, up $260 million compared with March 31, 2012. The increase was driven by $217 million of cash flow from operations plus $56 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $15 million in stock buybacks and $14 million of capital and IP purchases. We have $553 million board-authorized buybacks remaining. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $323 million at June 30 from $300 million at March 31, primarily reflecting our higher second quarter revenue. Our net inventory of $119 million at June 30 is equal to the March 31 balance. And with that I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the second quarter, we sold 150 da Vinci systems: 124 in the United States, 13 into Europe and 13 into rest of world markets. As part of the 150 system sales, 12 standard da Vinci systems and 23 da Vinci S Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 115 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2,341 the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide: 1,707 in the U.S., 389 in Europe and 245 in rest of world markets. 79 of the 150 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 142 of the 150 systems sold represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 28 dual console systems. The 26 system sales internationally included 7 into Japan, 4 into France and 3 into the U.K. Clinically, we had a solid quarter, achieving year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 26%. Gynecology, general surgery, along with the emerging categories of thoracic and head and neck surgery, accounted for a large part of this growth. Da Vinci Hysterectomy, Cholecystectomy, Colon and Rectal Resections, Lobectomy, Endometriosis Resections, Myomectomy and Partial Nephrectomy exhibited strong quarter-over-quarter growth, which was partially offset by dVP softness in the United States. The recent pressure from nonsurgical disease management, namely active surveillance, as well as an apparent decline in PSA screening has caused some pull back in the U.S. dVP number. As the incumbent leader in the surgical treatment of prostate cancer, it's difficult, perhaps impossible to remain unaffected by this larger trend, at least in the short term. Recently released new products continue to do well, most notably Single-Site. Early customer feedback has been positive and our initial sales have been strong. Within the first 2 quarters, post-launch, we've sold Single-Site kits to over 200 U.S. customers, while demand for training remains strong. We initiated our phased rollout of the vessel sealer product in February and its use within the segments of general, colorectal and GYN surgery has begun. The product is performing well and the feature set, specifically the articulated risk design, appears to be satisfying a strong market need. Operationally, we continue to make progress toward optimizing the manufacturing process while reducing product costs. Regarding system attachments, namely da Vinci Simulator and da Vinci Firefly. Both attachment rates remained high in the second quarter. Strong market acceptance for these products has helped buoy our da Vinci system ASP to an all-time high. During the quarter, over 350 robotic abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer-reviewed journals, and the clinical conferences were abundant with live da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses and podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. The adoption of our international dVH business has lagged behind the United States for both malignant and benign conditions, not surprising. We believe that dVH for the treatment of malignant conditions will likely pace the international GYN business. In a recent edition of the International Journal of Gynecologic Cancer, doctors Mark and Yang [ph] from the National University in Singapore, published a study describing the conversion of their open hysterectomy practice to a da Vinci Hysterectomy practice in treating endometrial cancer. Open surgery is the standard of care for endometrial cancer staging in Singapore, as it is in many other countries. This study compared the results of open hysterectomy to dVH in 124 consecutive endometrial cancer patients. The patients in each cohort were of similar age, BMI and pre-existing health condition. The authors reported that their operating time was longer during their initial 20 dVH procedures but had dropped significantly thereafter and were subsequently on par with the comparator. Lymph node harvests were also slightly lower within the initial 20 cases, but were similar thereafter. However, dVH was associated with 56% less blood loss than open surgery; had a lower rate of postoperative complications, 8.8% versus 26.8%; and a lower wound complication rate, 0% versus 9.9%. In addition, the requirement for postoperative parenteral analgesia was only 5.9% for the dVH patients as compared with 51.1% for the open laparotomy patients. And hospitalization was reduced to 2 days for the dVH patients as compared to 5.9 days for the open laparotomy group. They concluded their paper by stating and I quote, "Our series shows that outcomes traditionally associated with laparoscopic endometrial cancer staging are achievable by laparoscopically naive gynecologic cancer surgeons moving from laparotomy to robotic-assisted endometrial cancer staging after a relatively small number of cases." Early data for da Vinci Single-Sites choles is being collected at various sites within the U.S. and abroad, while the initial EU publications begin to appear in the literature. In a recent edition of the Archives of Surgery, a consortium made up of 5 leading Italian robotic centers published initial results of their first 100 Single-Site cholecystectomy procedures. The paper entitled Overcoming the Challenges of Single Incision Cholecystectomy with Robotic Single-Site Technology, described the contribution of traditional single incision laparoscopy as an important development step in moving from multiple site laparoscopy to single incision interventions. However, single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomies has not gained wide spread use due in large part to the physical limitations of the technology, which compromises optimal triangulation, the overall ergonomics of the procedure and quality of view, this, according to the authors. They also reported that the combination of these factors provides challenges for optimal tissue exposure and that traditional instruments platforms have significant limitation when used for SILS. They went on to say and I quote, "Da Vinci Single-Site Cholecystectomy was regarded as a safe procedure by all surgeons involved in this study and as safe as standard four-port laparoscopic operation." They also reported that 4 out of the 5 surgeons participating in this trial claimed to be considering the extension of da Vinci Single-Site Technology toward treating other conditions. In their conclusion, they wrote and I quote, "The robotic technology is a compensatory technique that can overcome the constraints and the ergonomic limitations of SILS and is potentially capable of realizing the full potential of single-access approach. We showed that it allows for the quick overcoming of the learning curve that is typical to most new procedures, particularly of laparoscopic single incision approach. This is likely to increase the safety of single-incision surgery, and in turn, expand adoption to a wider number of general surgeons and surgical procedures." In a recent edition of the British Journal of Urology, an interesting paper out of Asia authored by Dr. Shin Dong Chung [ph] and others from National University Hospital in Taiwan studied the readmission rates for patients who have undergone open prostatectomy, lap prostatectomy and robotic prostatectomy. The nationwide Taiwanese study included 2,741 patients, studied over a 5-year period with the objective of determining the sub 90-day readmission rate associated with each of the 3 techniques. The reduction of readmission rates is a goal shared by all economies since the associated costs can be quite significant for payers and patients. In total, 257 or 9.4% of the 2,741 patients studied required a readmission to a hospital within 90 days post surgery. The diagnosis for readmission included intestinal infections, UTIs, hernias, pneumonia, prostatic hypertrophy, retention of urine and postoperative infection. The authors reported that the readmission rate for traditional laparoscopic prostatectomy patients was more than twice as common than for patients undergoing a dVP. 8.2% for lap versus 3.6% for dVP. When comparing the readmission rate for open prostatectomy to dVP, the frequency of readmission was nearly 3x as great, 10.7% versus 3.6%. In a written discussion, the author stated and I quote, "In the present study, we clearly showed that patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy had a lower risk of 90-day readmission than the patients undergoing open prostatectomy. We think that the present study is an important step in helping to define the relative efficacy of robotic prostatectomy, laparoscopic prostatectomy and open prostatectomy as a treatment option for localized prostate cancer. Moreover, the present findings may prove valuable to patients trying to make an objective decision about the various treatment options. Because the present study used nationwide population-based data sets, its robust findings can be generalized to a population as a whole." This concludes my remarks. And I'll now turn the time over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2012, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast procedures to grow approximately 25% to 27% from a base of approximately 360,000 procedures performed in 2011. Halfway through 2012, our procedure growth stands at 27%. During the second quarter, we saw a continued strength in U.S. gynecology and general surgery procedures, while we experienced a pull back in U.S. dVP volume and challenges in our European procedure business. Based upon the net of these factors, we continue to forecast full year 2012 da Vinci procedure volume to grow approximately 25% to 27% above our 2011 total. Moving on to revenues. We are increasing our 2012 revenue guidance. Based primarily upon capital sales trends and revenue contributions from new products, we now expect 2012 revenue to grow between 20% and 23% above total 2011 revenue of $1.76 billion. This is up from the 19% to 21% revenue growth forecast on our previous call. Specifically related to system ASP, as Marshall mentioned, our Q2 ASP came in at $1.53 million. This metric largely resulted from favorable channel, trade-in and product mix. Going forward, we would expect to see a system sales mix more in line with previous patterns. In addition, euro-based system ASPs will be lower in U.S. dollar terms due to the weaker euro. As a result, we would expect system ASP to return to more historic levels realized in previous quarters. Overall, we would expect our total Q3 2012 revenue to be near or possibly below our Q2 level. Now turning to expenses. Consistent with our last call, we continue to forecast full year noncash compensation to fall within a range of between $152 million and $156 million for the year. The timing of these expenses however will be considerably different in 2012 as compared to prior years. As Marshall mentioned, in 2012, we began issuing employee option grants in 2 installments, one in February and one in August, rather than a single February grant. As a result, in 2012, Q1 and Q2 received lower proportions of the full year expense and Q3 will receive a significantly higher proportion. Specifically, 2012 actual stock compensation was $34.4 million in Q1 and $33.3 million in Q2. We would expect Q3 stock compensation to be between $13 million and $14 million higher than Q2 and come in around $47 million then declining to around $40 million in Q4. R&D expenses. Based upon the timing of various R&D projects, we anticipate a significant uptick in Q3 R&D expense compared to Q2. Based upon the timing of stock compensation and R&D expenses and continuing business growth, we would expect Q3 operating expenses to come in over $20 million higher than Q2. Now turning to operating income. Consistent with our previous forecast, we continue to expect operating income to fall within a range of between 39% and 40% of net revenue. Again, while second quarter operating income came at 42% of sales and we stand at 40.6% on a year-to-date basis, based upon the timing of expenses I just described, we expect full year operating expense to come in within our 39% to 40% guidance range. We expect other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, to total between $16 million and $17 million for the year. With regard to income tax, our Q2 reported tax rate of 32.4% was above the 31% projection on our last call. While our Q2 tax rate was higher than the forecasted rate, our estimates for Q3 and Q4 remains about the same, 31% of pretax income rate. We estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q3 2012 will be approximately 41.7 million shares. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we will now open the call for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Gary, maybe give us some insights into dVP trends here and how far you think that may go down. If you can give us some sense of what happened in the quarter. Where does this stabilize in your view based on the trends? And it does something. It's a broader industry shift in terms of the way patients are being managed. And obviously it’s becoming less important with the growth of the other pieces, but just wanted to understand and isolate that bit if we can.
Gary S. Guthart: Yes. The way we look at it is really being driven by 2 different effects. One of them has been the scrutiny and discussion around PSA testing and what that impact is. It's hard for us to exactly handicap what the impact on PSA test and discussion is. But clearly as one of the major treatment modalities for prostate cancer care, if there are changes to PSA testing in the number of people going into the pipeline, that will flow-through to us. And then the second part that you've described has been, if there is a look at nonsurgical treatment modalities and other alternatives like active surveillance, that also will have an impact. Hard for us to predict where that will play out over the long haul. We know for -- with high confidence that surgery is the best treatment for men with high risk prostate cancer, there's really no question. And now the question is going to be okay, while surgical societies and surgeons look at this over the long term: how do they vector patients in through their treatment pathways. What we've seen in the past, just one more comment, is that over time as men are moved into active surveillance and those kind have come in waves, having to do with the amount of publicity it gets. Over time, people will start coming back out of active surveillance either because cancer is progressing or because over time, the active surveillance is in itself a burden. So hard to predict with a quantitative sense exactly where that will head. But clearly those 2 factors are having an impact on us in the U.S.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: But maybe try another way, Gary, I mean, was it down single-digit percentage, double digit? And what's baked in the guidance for the balance of the year?
Gary S. Guthart: On our side, it was a significant push. I don't -- we don't usually break out the numbers for you quarterly. And so we've gone through and done our best to project. It's an estimate. And if I had a perfect crystal ball, I'd share it with you, but we don't.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then you talked about some of the timing of research projects. Maybe give us some an insight as to what those are. And are we going to see a structural shift in R&D spending perhaps higher? And also on the operating expense side, can you talk a little bit about opportunities for investment in the sales force? Are you're looking to accelerate that to move things along quicker or maybe offset some of the prostatectomy weakness in other applications? Or are you happy with kind of where the trends are set there?
Gary S. Guthart: Fair question and a lot of questions. The first side on the R&D and the projects side, as you know, we have a few things that we have been working on pretty hard. Stapler, you should think of stapler not as a single product. Stapler will really ultimately be a family of products, kind of a platform. And that will come out in sequential releases. So there is a set of releases and products that make sense for colorectal surgery, a different set that makes sense for thoracic surgery and a different set that might make sense for bariatric surgery in the future. And so those things will move in sequence. Likewise, vessel sealing is a strong instrument for us. Right now it's pointed at general surgery applications and complex gynecologic cancers. But we can see that as being a platform technology as well. So there are investments here that are sequential. As you know, we also work on Single-Site expansion, other sets of instruments, and then other things longer term in terms of platform improvements. It's -- I guess what I'd say is the signal from Q2 to Q3 has more to do with lumpiness and timing than it does kind of a seismic shift in the kind of work we're doing. There is some gradual sequential growth in R&D spend. But mostly what you're seeing is lumpiness. Turning to the question of sales force investments. We are making investments in the sales force. The way you might think about that is significant investments in Japan in terms of our capability. We're happy with our team there, and they're growing, and that will be to allow us to have a greater presence over time. We're also making investments in Europe. The investments there are around the sales and commercial team, mostly around bringing in experience in selling and support skills, as well as investments in our ability to respond to regulatory needs and reimbursement and economic analysis needs. So we're making those investments there. They're kind of investments that are ahead of what you would think of as the U.S. norms. In the U.S, we continue to invest in the U.S. sales force although about on pace to what you've seen in past quarters. We don't feel like we're ahead or behind there, but really moving in sync.
Marshall L. Mohr: Specifically we added about 20 people to our clinical team in the quarter bringing us up to about 600 on the clinical side. We stayed roughly flat about 90 on the capital side.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: If I can sneak in one more quick one. It looks like you had a strong de novo placement effort in the quarter. Talk a little bit about how Si-e affected that. And I heard the number 200 customers. Are you starting to see a lot of productivity from that in terms of initial cases? And are people actually doing cases beyond chole already?
Gary S. Guthart: So I'll just start and Aleks can add, jump in. On the Single-Site versus Si-e, something a little bit different. But with regard to Single-Site, initial purchases, we did say over 200 hospitals in the U.S. have taken their initial kits. We're seeing good utilization so far although its early. The response, the commentary in terms of safety and efficacy and repeatability, the ability to learn the procedure quickly is strong, so we're feeling good about that. But we do caution that we're still in the early quarters there. With regard to people having an interest to doing things beyond cholecystectomy, we're FDA approved in the U.S. for chole. There is surgeon interest o U.S. and discussed interest inside the U.S. to do some other things. And so we're seeing interest in certain gynecologic procedures perhaps, some upper GI procedures over time, and that's where our R&D teams are spending their time. I'll turn it to Aleks.
Aleks Cukic: Yes, I would just reiterate under the comments pertaining to the 200 customers that have purchased initial sites. What we can tell thus far really from that is that there is a lot of general interest to try the system. We can't -- it's too early to make any large clinical claims, other than people are looking at reduced cosmetic -- improved cosmetics, I should say, and then whether or not there's pain differences between one technique versus the other. But at this stage, it's very difficult to say. But the interest is high to try it. The training queue is strong, and we'll look at it for a few more quarters I think before we can assess much more.
Gary S. Guthart: Yes, in terms of the Si-e impact on the quarter, 6 of the 150 systems sold were Si-e systems. And to remind you, Si-e's are 3-arm versions of Si and also have some other feature reductions. And they're primarily targeted towards the more price-sensitive customers who are engaged in the Single-Site or engaged in maybe a lesser complex hysterectomy. I think we are seeing more interest in this particular segment of our product offering.
Operator: And our next question will come from Lennox Ketner with Bank of America.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess if we can maybe just shift gears and focus on Europe for a minute. I guess I just wanted to understand in your view kind of what's driving the lower procedure growth. I know you talked about it being some structural issues. But in terms of the austerity measures impacting it -- I guess why I'm struggling a little bit is because it's -- obviously we've seen elective procedures impacted there. Because it's a cancer surgery, I would have thought we'd see less. Are you essentially seeing the government just lower their quotas for these surgeries even though they're cancer surgeries?
Gary S. Guthart: We definitely see -- depends on which country you're in. And I guess I'd start by saying different countries are behaving a little bit differently. So one answer won't cover them all. But taking a couple as an example, we have seen pressure on quotas. For sure you see total budgets getting pressured and people are making decisions about how they want to spend that money. We think some of it has to do a little bit with how we've grown our organization and their training and skill. If I just stand back from the point of view of bringing clinical and economic value to procedure that would have been open and taking it to noninvasive da Vinci procedure. We think there's value there. And we think we can do well in the presence of even tight budgets. And that's really the internal part that we're working on.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. So I guess just as a follow-up. You had mentioned that you're investing in regulatory and reimbursement. If you -- is that -- are you focused on changing kind of reimbursement themes [ph] in Europe or was the reimbursement question or comment more directed towards Japan?
Gary S. Guthart: Well, the answer is a little bit of both. In Japan, it tends to be a more direct conversation with surgical societies in the government. In Europe it tends to be a little bit more working with surgical societies and health technology assessment groups to really understand the clinical benefits and the long-term, the downstream economic benefits of da Vinci Surgery. And it really is a way for hospitals and customers to understand what the total economics are.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then just last question on the Single-Site, the attachment for that. Is it possible just to give us some sense as when a hospital does buy the Single-Site attachment, how much you're charging for that? And is that revenue recorded in -- as part of an upgrade revenue or is that in insurance and accessories?
Marshall L. Mohr: Well, just to let everyone know, the Single-Site is a set of instruments and accessory really instruments that attach to the da Vinci Si System. And so there's no system upgrade required to do Single-Site procedures. Usually initial customers, you need to have the 8.5-millimeter endoscopes, as well as the specific instruments for the case and so on. So it's an investment I think on average out of the gate it might be something like a $40,000 investment to kind of get going. It's recorded on the instrument and accessory line.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to go back to kind of the discussion on dVP from before, and understand obviously with the change in screening intervals, that's one aspect. But as we think about watchful waiting, do you have any color on what the conversion factor is in terms of patients going into watchful waiting and then coming back and heading into surgery? And obviously with PIVOT back in the news, is there anything you need to do differently in terms of data generation or marketing given that it's back in kind of the public press, if you will?
Gary S. Guthart: I'll speak to the first one. I'll let Aleks speak to the second one. With regard to what kind of behavior has been historically with regard to people on active surveillance in very, very rough outlines. It's been about 1/3 -- start in active surveillance and stay in active surveillance throughout. About 1/3 will convert to aggressive disease and in essence be kicked out by progression, and about 1/3 will choose to leave because of the repeated going back in to being tested. At some point they decide to rather -- they'd rather have a definitive treatment. And that's been historical and it's rough. We'll see if it holds going forward.
Aleks Cukic: With regards to the second part of your question, the PIVOT trial being back in the news. I don't know that there was anything that was new that was reported today. I think this is something that we've discussed, I think, over the past year since it had been presented at the AUA. I think the editorial that accompanied the actual report in The New England Journal of Medicine really says, I think -- has a pretty consistent tone to I think the way we think about it as well.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just to clarify your comments in Europe. I'm just not understanding why the volumes are really declining here when you've got nationalized health care in a lot of these markets? Is it really that variable in these geographies?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes. Short answer is yes, it's variable. You have a few different things and, again, I think you have to think, well what's happening thing in Norway, what's happening in Spain, what's happening Germany, what's happening in France, what's happening in U.K., what's happening in the Scandinavian countries, and they vary. In many of the countries, you have a combination of private health systems and public ones. Their behaviors vis-a-vis da Vinci are quite different. And so depending on what the mix of private and public is and what the government-run hospitals are wanting to do, we'll see different kind of dynamics and behavior.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then last one, as we think about some of the gives and takes around procedures, I understand obviously you didn't change guidance on procedures this year. But do you see a path north of 30% in that kind of medium to intermediate term the next couple of years given everything you've got in terms of the new procedures or -- I don't want to box you into giving longer-term guidance, but how do you think about where procedures could go?
Gary S. Guthart: Our best thoughts are in the guidance we provide you.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I was talking beyond this year though.
Gary S. Guthart: And we'll talk to you about that in January.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Gary, these comments about dVP in the U.S., most of the comments so far have really focused on utilization or sort of patient-demand creation. I wonder have you seen anything in the U.S. that would suggest that maybe it's push and pull where it's a hospital specific issue, so I'm really referring to ACOs, demonstration projects with the hospitals just sort of targeting prostatectomy for its declining profitability or something like that, or this is a very acutely the patients just aren't proceeding to surgery and aren't showing up?
Gary S. Guthart: Without having talked to every hospital in the U.S., I have not heard the concern that you just voiced, that hospital is trying to direct patients one way or another due to their perceived profitability. Generally speaking, most hospitals will offer both or all 3 alternatives. They'll counsel all of them. And in that setting, where all the alternatives are discussed and a patient has been diagnosed, da Vinci does well, and we've seen a lot of stability there. So short answer is it tends to be more diagnosis and nonsurgical approaches than it is, I think, directed intervention.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then the clear positive this quarter sort of on the capital side in the U.S. is, you know, multiple capital peers have reported sort of softness in the second quarter. You don't appear to have exhibited any of that softness. Is it safe to assume that you feel, at least as far as the second quarter is concerned, relatively insulated from some of the factors that may have been out there or some of the push-outs that some of your peers had seen in the second quarter?
Gary S. Guthart: Well, again, I think that term insulated has got a few meanings. But I would say that if you look at and again, back away from just that number for a second and look at the overall procedure business. We've reported a 26% gain in procedures year-over-year, and for the first half of the year, it's up 27%. That's still a pretty large number. And so, that does necessitate the demand for systems. And so we do believe that. We do we believe that very strongly. I don't think there was a particular event or an episode in Q2 that separated us from our peer group or other capital companies anymore than just strong procedure demand. And now there are, as you said earlier, puts and takes on the procedures, while one has gone down, several have gone up, and some have gone up pretty significantly. And on balance, it's a very strong procedure business. And I think that's really what separates us from some of the other companies that are up there when you look at the actual numbers and the percentage of growth. So short of that, I don't think there's anything else we can really point to.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And then just, Gary, maybe one quick one if I could. The comments about Europe, I wonder, have you seen anything in Europe over the last couple of quarters or several quarters that would suggest that perhaps the market development in Europe is going to be different than the U.S.? In one particular way, we would be, in the U.S. you never engaged in a directed significant study to prove a specific procedure, but you had a wealth of single center experience data and multicenter experience that was generated by users. Is there a sense sort of based on what you're seeing in Europe that a more directed or active approach to clinical data is going to be required in Europe or is that not the case?
Gary S. Guthart: I think a more active conversation is required, and that's a little bit of what we've been talking about with regard to health technology assessments and other things. We have -- now we've been in the market long enough in some procedures over a decade. That's because actually large population-based studies that are well done, multicenter, tens of thousands of patients in them, show clear benefits for da Vinci over other surgical alternatives. There's data being generated around comparisons to other kinds of treatment modalities between Da Vinci Surgery and nonsurgical outcomes. And I think that data is going to be helpful worldwide and in Europe. There may be cases and certainly we're in conversation and have thoughts and plans around specific trials that may help us in different locales, and Europe is one of them.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Just to pick up on Europe. Gary, I think I heard you correctly. It sounds like there's a change in the leadership there. And if I caught that accurately, if you could kind of just walk us through kind of what's changing and kind of what's the strategic direction?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes. We have changed leadership in terms of leadership of commercial organization in the direct side of Europe, and as well as overall leadership over the indirect as well. This is somebody who's been with us for many years in the U.S. and that run the national accounts side of the business here in the United States. He knows our business very well, has had prior experiences in Europe, and so he'll be taking over there.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: But I guess part of the question is, is that a result of the current environment or needing to change your strategic tactics within Europe coming back to needing more discussions around the marketing of the device and the procedures? Just trying to understand perhaps what there maybe the change in strategy in the European region?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes, I think it's probably less of -- capital less strategy change and more a focus on execution and organizational growth and capability. There are some things that we can do a little bit differently and perhaps a little bit better in terms of some of the conversations on the economic side. So sort of small strategy. I don't think it's Earth shatteringly different, but I do think it's an emphasis change, and they're working on those things.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then the -- obviously, it's terrific to hear that the Single-Site procedures are starting to gain some traction, and I fully understand that it's going to take a couple of quarters to fully feel that out. I guess the conversations that we've had with folks would suggest that where there is a da Vinci in place, the general surgeons are eager to jump in and get some time on the system to try out these procedures. And generally we've heard very good things once they get to do it. But I guess the question that I sort of wrestle with is, there are an awful lot of general surgical procedures, prostatectomies in particular, are probably done at institutions that today don't have a da Vinci system. So can you make a convincing ROI argument that this system can be used for general surgery sort of as a standalone device even with the Si-e option? Or at some point, does there have to be a segmentation strategy?
Marshall L. Mohr: Well, Larry, if you look at the overall number of da Vinci placements in the United States, we have a 1,707 total systems and I believe the number of U.S. customers -- Calvin, will give us that. I believe it's somewhere -- 1,200 to 1,300, I believe. But if you...
Calvin Darling: 1,275.
Gary S. Guthart: 1,275. The way -- what we have seen in prostatectomy for example is that the system has, to this point, become somewhat of a consolidator for the procedure rather than having to put procedures in all, and I should say, put systems in all 4,800 or 5,000 hospitals that are out there. You've seen a strong consolidation of, let's say, the urologic oncology business happen around the same base of systems that prior to the minimally invasive introduction was being done at significantly more hospitals. Fewer were being done at more hospitals. So I don't think we look at it and say, can we necessarily build this self-standing platform with general surgery as a paramount question today? Now what we do believe is that with the increased interest both from the colorectal surgeons, from other complex and general surgery procedures, as well as the individual cholecystectomy procedures that there is enough capacity out there for people to actually try, use it and then build into the flow of the robotics coordinators in the hospital to make sure that there is enough access whether it becomes second systems or third systems, et cetera. But the cholecystectomies by themselves is probably not the way we think about it. I think general surgery, as a whole, and then leveraging the installed base that we have.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Understood. And then just last one, not to continue to come back to U.S. prostatectomy. But I guess any flavor for where U.S. prostatectomy procedures, I assume, they were down sequentially. And would you characterize it as sort of a sharp falloff relative to where we've been over the last couple of quarters or sort of been a gradual decline and now we've hit a point where we're down year-over-year?
Gary S. Guthart: I think the way we think about it and really what the numbers will tell us that it's been a gradual decline over the past few quarters. We've called it out in the past, and now we're calling it out with a little more emphasis. And there appears to be more evidence in the sort of macroenvironment for prostate cancer that we can refer to with a little more clarity.
Operator: We'll go to Jose Haresco with JMP Securities.
Jose T. Haresco - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions. On Single-Sites chole. You guys haven't broken this out in the past. Are you at a point where you can kind of give us a sense of how many procedures you think you've done in Single-Site chole, or just in general, who many Single-Site procedures have been done since these 200 devices have been placed -- I'm sorry, sets have been placed out there?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes, we're not ready yet to start breaking that out. Just because we're still on the early days of seeing new sites come up and really work through their initial orders. And what we would like to see is what happens on a sustained basis. How much of their future business they start to convert to Single-Site and so on, and that's just too early to tell. So we're happy to tell you -- to talk a little bit qualitatively about how the initial installs are going, but we'll wait a little bit on sequential use.
Jose T. Haresco - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Just on Europe trend [ph] a little more. Can you give us a little more granularity between say regions of Europe, Southern Europe versus Western Europe as an example, and then, procedures versus hardware? You guys raised the system guidance, revenue guidance for the year. I want to get a better sense for where that confidence is coming from beyond just the slight increase in ASP that we saw in the quarter?
Gary S. Guthart: On the kind of the break-outs country-by-country, it's a little bit mixed, probably not real surprising that some of the countries in the south that are always in the news have been most trained in terms of both system sales and procedures. Although I'd say that Italy has been a bright spot. We have seen some pressure in both capital and procedures in some of the core countries of Europe as well. And that's kind of where we are and what we are working through.
Gary S. Guthart: That was our last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience from Rebecca in Maryland gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. "I went to Dr. Katherine Kratz upon discovering that I had a uterine fibroid and endometrial cysts, which had been causing painful menstrual cramps, as well as severe lower back pain. Dr. Kratz recommended da Vinci surgery for several reasons. The procedure is minimally invasive, so the recovery time would be much quicker. At the time I was trying to finish up my dissertation and apply for academic jobs, so it was important to me to have a quick recovery. My surgeon also explained that this procedure allows for greater visualization of the area, as well as providing for her a greater range of motion, allowing her to work with great precision in performing the surgery and in doing the stitches. Because of this, Dr. Kratz was able to save my left ovary, which would not have been possible otherwise. After my surgery, not only was I able to return to working on my dissertation within a few days but I was also able to attend my annual professional conference a few weeks later. Even with all that I have been told, I was shocked at how quickly I had recovered from surgery. Everyday I was able to move more easily and with far less pain, allowing me to stop taking pain medication after 1 day or 2. Now I'm free of back pain and have nearly no menstrual cramps. I'm extremely grateful for the da Vinci Surgery and the excellent care I received from Dr. Kratz and her entire surgical team, because the surgery has significantly improved my quality of life. When I look back at my time -- at that time of my life, I have only positive memories of my surgical experience. My surgeon provided me with comprehensive information about my options and about the surgery and allowed me to make the decision that was best for my situation." Patients like these are the strongest advocates for Da Vinci Surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. And I assure you that we remain committed to driving about [ph] a few things that really make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for participating -- for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical First Quarter Earnings Release Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's First Quarter Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archives section under our investor relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter's results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights. Then, I will provide an update to our financial forecast for 2012. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary S. Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. In this first quarter, our team has executed well and we have experienced strong performance in procedures, encouraging acceptance of our new products and the financial results that follow. For 2012, Intuitive is focused on the following: first, continuing our growth in gynecology and urology worldwide through outstanding execution in the field; second, disciplined execution of our Single-Site and vessel sealing launches focused on outstanding early customer experiences; third, building robust clinical programs with leading customers in emerging procedures and general surgery, thoracic surgery and transoral surgery; and finally, strengthening our capabilities in the international markets, particularly Europe, Japan and Korea. With regard to procedures, we experienced strong growth in general surgery and gynecology, leading to a year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 29%. With uptake in colorectal procedures and the introduction of Single-Site in the United States, the category of general surgery grew at the highest rate this quarter. Worldwide urology procedures grew year-over-year as well, led by growth in European dVP, while U.S. urology was flat. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. As we have mentioned on previous calls, we have been investing in improving our structural capabilities in Japan. Our team has worked with Japan's MHLW on reimbursement for da Vinci Prostatectomy, receiving reimbursement approval on April 1. Intuitive Surgical Japan has also successfully transitioned the import license for da Vinci S from Johnson & Johnson Japan to Intuitive Surgical Japan this month. We are encouraged by our progress in Japan and we will continue to invest to clear the path for increased da Vinci use. Overall, international system sales were encouraging. However, our first quarter system sales in Europe were somewhat disappointing. This is likely a combination of both economic pressures in Europe as well as organizational capability. Turning to operating highlights for the first quarter. Procedures grew 29% over the first quarter of 2011. We sold 140 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 120 during the first quarter of last year. Total revenue was $495 million, up 28% over last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $208 million, up 32% over Q1 of 2011. Total recurring revenue grew to $289 million, up 31% from prior year and comprising 58% of total revenue. Net income was $144 million, up 38% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $228 million before noncash stock option expense, up 26% from the first quarter of last year and representing 46% of Q1 revenue. We ended the quarter with $2,371,000,000 in cash and investments, up $199 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $50 million invested in the acquisition of our Korean distributor, fixed assets and intellectual property. Excluding the impact of these outlays as well as $83 million from stock proceeds and $30 million used for working capital, we generated $211 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 147% of our reported GAAP net income in the first quarter. The first quarter has been an active one for our product development, marketing and operations teams. In the quarter, we completed our first phase of rollout for our Single-Site instruments and accessories for da Vinci Si in the United States. Recall, Single-Site is a platform for increasing patient value by reducing the number of incisions required by traditional multiport minimally invasive surgery. Instead of the multiple incisions of traditional laparoscopy, the body is entered through a single incision at the umbilicus. Currently, Single-Site is cleared for single-incision cholecystectomy in the U.S. and for broader indications in Europe. Experiences by our Single-Site customers in the U.S. indicate that cholecystectomy procedure is safe, repeatable and teachable. Market response today has been very encouraging. We are working with our customers in Europe to identify procedures in which Single-Site can bring additional patient value beyond cholecystectomy. We continue to focus on developing products that enable surgeons to convert traditionally open surgeries to minimally invasive surgery using da Vinci. In the quarter, we completed our first customer access work on our EndoWrist vessel sealer and are pleased with its performance in surgery. Our vessel sealer brings to da Vinci surgeons full articulation and precise control. We think this instrument will facilitate robotic general surgery. We are communicating with FDA regarding our da Vinci stapler and we are making progress in answering their questions. In imaging, our Firefly Fluorescence Imaging system is now being used regularly to image kidney vasculature during da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy. Surgeons are also exploring the use of Firefly in visualizing blood flow in da Vinci colorectal procedures. As we enter new markets and drive into new product arenas, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter, we added 94 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 2,018 employees. I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall L. Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our first quarter revenue was $495 million, up 28% compared with $388 million for the first quarter of 2011 and $2 million less than the $497 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2011. First quarter revenues by product category were as follows. First quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $208 million, up 32% compared with $157 million for the first quarter of 2011 and up 6% compared with $196 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Year-over-year, instrument and accessory growth was driven by procedure growth of 29% and initial purchases of recently launched products, including Single-Site starter kits and our Firefly product. Note that the first quarter of 2012 included one more surgical day than the first quarter of 2011 due to leap year. Instrument and accessory growth relative to the first quarter of 2011 was primarily driven by procedure growth in sales of our Single-Site starter kits, partially offset by lower first quarter stocking orders associated with seasonally lower first quarter system sales. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders of $1,985 per procedure, was higher than the first quarter of 2011 by $50 and $10 higher than the fourth quarter of 2011. Over time, we expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly, given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base. This natural decline has been more than offset in recent quarters by the positive impact of our new instrument and accessory products, specifically, Single-Site, Firefly and our thoracic lung kit. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure will fluctuate based on the rate of adoption of newer products as well as product and procedure mix. First quarter 2012 systems revenue of $207 million increased 24% compared with $167 million of systems revenue for the first quarter of 2011 and decreased 8% compared with $225 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011. We sold 140 systems in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with 120 systems in the first quarter of 2011 and 152 systems in the fourth quarter of 2011. The first quarter of 2011 system count included systems involving trade-ins of older units comprised of 19 standard systems and 27 da Vinci S-es. The first quarter of 2011 system count included 13 standard trade-ins and 19 da Vinci S trade-ins, while the fourth quarter of 2011 included 23 standard trade-ins and 27 da Vinci S trade-ins. Our first quarter average selling price per system, including all da Vinci models, was $1.47 million, an increase from the $1.38 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the same as the fourth quarter. ASPs include simulators and systems configured with Firefly but exclude upgrades. The increase in average sales price relative to the first quarter of 2011 reflects a higher proportion of dual consoles, a higher number of systems shipped with surgical simulators and Firefly partially offset by an increased proportion of trade-ins. We sold 25 dual console systems in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 16 in the first quarter of 2011 and 29 in the fourth quarter of 2011. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix as well as foreign exchange rates on direct sales to foreign customers. Service revenue of $81 million increased 27% compared with $64 million last year and increased 7% compared with $75 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total first quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue of $289 million, increased 31% compared with the first quarter of 2011 and increased 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. Recurring revenue represented 58% of total first quarter revenue compared with 57% in the first quarter last year and 55% last quarter. International results were as follows. Procedures outside of the U.S. grew approximately 31% on a year-to-year basis led by growth in Europe, particularly dVPs. We also experienced growth in our other target procedures, including dVH in Europe. First quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $105 million increased 15% compared with revenue of $91 million in the first quarter of 2011 and decreased 2% compared with seasonally strong fourth quarter revenue of $107 million. Instrument and accessory revenue outside of the U.S. grew 24% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. We sold 35 systems outside of the U.S. compared with 31 in the first quarter of 2011 and 39 last quarter. We sold 14 systems in Europe in the first quarter compared with 15 in the first quarter of 2011 and 23 in the fourth quarter of 2011. European system sales reflect a challenging economic environment. However, we are also taking steps to improve our execution. Capital sales in rest-of-world markets increased to 21 systems in the first quarter compared with 16 in each of the first and fourth quarters of 2011. Aleks will provide additional details of overseas system sales. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the first quarter of 72% was the same as the first quarter of 2011 and lower than the 73% last quarter. The lower gross margin compared to the fourth quarter primarily reflected lower margins on our newly introduced products. Margins on newly launched products like Single-Site will typically be lower than our mature products, reflecting vendor pricing on low volume, temporary tooling costs and other start-up costs. However, over time as volumes increase, and we refine the manufacturing process in the product, we would expect to see improvement in the margins of these newer products. First quarter 2012 operating expenses of $163 million were 25% compared -- up 25% compared with the first quarter of 2011, and were approximately the same as those for the fourth quarter of 2011. Relative to the fourth quarter of operating expenses, the first quarter expenses included costs associated with employees added during the quarter and payroll taxes on a higher level of employee stock option exercises, offset by lower engineering project costs which fluctuate with prototype spending. We added 94 employees in the quarter, including 41 employees in commercial operations and 44 employees in product operations. First quarter 2012 operating income was $193 million or 39% of sales compared with $148 million or 38% of sales for the first quarter of 2011 and $200 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 operating income reflected $34 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $32 million for the fourth -- first quarter of 2011 and $35 million last quarter. We have changed our annual stock option grant process such that 1/2 of the employees' annual grants were issued on February 15 and the other 1/2 will be issued on August 15. The first quarter impact of the February 15 grant was more than offset by the full vesting of options granted in 2008. We would expect noncash compensation expense to increase in the second quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the February 15 grant, and then increase further in the third quarter with the August 15 grant. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 27% was lower than our rate for 2011 of 30%. The decrease reflects a one-time benefit associated with a change in the way the IRS interprets the rules associated with Section 199, domestic manufacturing tax credit. We expect the rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 31%. The increase relative to 2011 reflects no research and development credit, a lower mix of foreign earnings partially offset by ongoing Section 199 tax credit. Our net income was $144 million or $3.50 per share compared with $104 million or $2.59 per share for the first quarter of 2011 and $151 million or $3.75 per share for the fourth quarter of 2011. Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and investments of $2.4 billion, up $199 million compared with December 31, 2011. The increase reflects $167 million of cash flow from operations, $83 million from the exercise of stock option partially offset by $50 million associated with the purchase of our Korean distributor, purchase of capital and IP. During the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any of our common stock. However,, we retained the option to exercise the remaining Board-authorized buybacks of $568 million. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $300 million at March 31 from $298 million at December 31. Our net inventory increased to $119 million at March 31 from $112 million at December 31. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the first quarter, we sold 140 da Vinci systems: 105 in the United States, 14 into Europe and 21 into rest of world markets. As part of the 140 system sales, 19 standard da Vinci Systems and 27 da Vinci S Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 94 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2,226 the accumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 1,615 in the United States, 379 in Europe and 232 in rest of world markets. 80 of the 140 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 132 of the 140 systems sold represented da Vinci Si systems, which included 25 dual console systems. The 35 system sales internationally included 7 into Japan, 4 into India and 3 into the countries of Italy, the U.K. and Australia. While our overall international system sales were strong, our Q1 EU system sales were somewhat disappointing and below historical trends. Clinically, we had a strong quarter, achieving an overall year-over-year procedure growth rate of approximately 29%. Gynecology, international dVP, along with the emerging categories of general surgery and thoracic surgery, accounted for a large part of this growth. Cholecystectomy, colon and rectal resections, lobectomy, dVH, endometriosis resections, myomectomy and partial nephrectomy all exhibited strong year-over-year growth. International dVP growth remained strong both in Europe and rest of world. However,, in the U.S., dVP has felt some recent pressure from non-surgical disease management, mainly active surveillance. With the international market playing an every ever-increasing role in the worldwide procedure numbers, overall worldwide dVP growth remains positive. Recent new product launches are all proceeding well. The attachment rate for both the da Vinci simulator and our Firefly product remain high, which is helping to buoy da Vinci system ASPs. The initial customer response to our da Vinci Single-Site product line has been very positive, with many centers up and running and several more scheduled for training. We initiated a phased rollout of the vessel sealer product in the second half of the quarter, and early customers are beginning to perform their initial cases. The product is performing well and early customer feedback has been positive. But as with all new product launches, customer feedback processes and operational scaling will remain central themes. Throughout this period, the focus of our operations team will be to optimize manufacturing while reducing cost. During the quarter, over 350 abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer review journals, while the clinical conferences were abundant with live da Vinci procedure transmissions, post-graduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. As we've discussed, da Vinci colon and rectal surgery is an emerging category and is receiving a lot of clinical interest and for good reason. While clinical experiences for laparoscopic colon and rectal surgery date back to 1991, the adoption has been lagging. In a recent edition of the American Surgeon, Dr. Joseph Carmichael and his colleagues from the University of California Irvine published a comprehensive review on the utilization of laparoscopy in colorectal surgery for cancer in academic medical centers. In it, they segment various colorectal surgical procedures as they relate to laparoscopic adoption. University Hospital Consortium or UHC is a large organization consisting of 112 academic medical centers and their affiliates, representing approximately 90% of the nation's non-profit academic medical centers. The study, based on data from the UHC database, included records from 22,780 patients who had undergone open or laparoscopic colon and rectal surgery for cancer between 2007 and 2009. Interestingly, 19,408 or over 85% of these patients received an open surgery as compared to 3,372 or 14.8% who had received a laparoscopic procedure. The study reports that, as a percentage, the most commonly performed laparoscopic colon resection was a total colectomy at 22.6%, followed by a sigmoid resection at 17.3%. The least common were abdominoperineal resections at 8%, transverse colon resections at 10%. When subcategories were consolidated and analyzed, it was reported that laparoscopic surgery was incorporated in less than 20% of colon cancer resections and less than 10% of rectal cancer resections. Historically, both patient value and da Vinci's procedure adoption have been strongest where a traditional lap in MIS adoption has been limited. This is often the case within procedure categories where MIS is deemed clinically challenging. While every procedure has its own set of variables, prostatectomy, complex hysterectomy, partial nephrectomy, myomectomy, sacrocolpopexy and lobectomy have shared at least one common bond, which is that, each of them, despite years of clinical effort, was limited to a relatively small number of centers, resulting in limited MIS penetration. We believe that MIS colorectal surgery is consistent with this theme. While laparoscopic colorectal surgery is limited in the U.S., lap colon initiatives throughout Korean and Japanese universities have been more ambitious, which has led to some academic analysis of da Vinci's role versus laparoscopy. A comparative study of urinary voiding and sexual function following a total mesorectal excision or TME for rectal cancer was recently published in the Annals of Surgical Oncology. The study, authored by Dr. Young-Joon Kim and his colleagues from Yonsei University, compared laparoscopic and robotic TME as it relates to complications in urinary incontinence and sexual function, which are both common complications in rectal cancer surgery. 69 patients who underwent a lap or robotic procedure were prospectively enrolled. Their urogenital function was evaluated by uroflowmetry. Standard questionnaires to establish an international prostate symptom score and international index of erectile function score were given before surgery and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post surgery. Their initial findings were not surprising in that bladder function within both cohorts significantly decreased 1 month post surgery. In the lap TME group, urinary dysfunction gradually improved over a 6-month period, which is consistent with previously reported open surgery TME studies. In other words, both lap and open TME required 6 months for ISP scores to decrease. However, interestingly, patients who underwent robotic TME showed significantly earlier recovery at a period of less than 3 months. They also analyzed the urinary flow where the most objective urinary function results were obtained. The robotic TME showed no decrease in mean voiding volume. The robotic TME urinary data analysis revealed superior outcomes compared to laparoscopic TME data, not only in ISP score but also in urinary flow. With respect to erectile function, the robotic TME group showed earlier recovery as compared to the laparoscopic TME group, 6 months versus 12 months. They stated that, during pelvic dissection, avulsion or direct injury of the nerve plexus can easily happen, which is tied to post-operative sexual and urinary dysfunction. Enhanced 3D HD magnified views, along with 7 degrees of instrument freedom, were found to be of high value during delicate dissection. In their conclusions, the authors stated, and I quote: "We conclude that the use of da Vinci's surgical robotic TME system allowed for an earlier recovery in voiding and sexual function because it enabled meticulous dissection and maintenance of adequate countertraction strength as a result of enhanced dexterity." As stated earlier, our GYN franchise remains robust. While most of our previous growth has been U.S.-centric, we are beginning to experience dVH expansion in non-U.S. markets. As was the case in the United States, complex dVH from malignant conditions appears to be the catalyst. In this month's edition of Obstetrics & Gynecology, a group made up of both surgeons and epidemiologists from Jewish General Hospital and McGill University in Montréal, published their 2-year findings on both patient outcomes and economics associated with their robotic GYN cancer program. A total of 303 endometrial cancer patients were involved in this study. Following the initial -- the initiation of their robotics program, 143 consecutive dVH patients were compared to 160 consecutive patients who underwent surgery prior to the robotic program commencement. These 160 patients made up the historical cohort. Within the historical cohort, the rate of minimally invasive surgery performed with traditional laparoscopy was 17%. During the following 2 post-da Vinci years, the MIS rate had grown to 98%. Patient characteristics were comparable in both eras, except for an even higher body mass index in the robotics era. Robotic patients had longer operating times but fewer adverse events, 13% compared to 42%; lower estimated median blood loss, lower by approximately 70%; and shorter median hospital stay, 2.2 days compared with 5.5 days. The overall hospital cost for the robotic group was significantly lower as compared with the historical group, CAD $7,644 compared with CAD $10,368. The gains with robotic surgery are even more pronounced in a multivariable analysis where they considered both the full cohorts and matched sub-cohorts. The reduction in grade 2 or higher complications resulting in far less hospitalization drove significant dVH-related hospital savings. However, the key factor in evaluating any cancer treatment is oncologic outcome. At present, the 2-year post-dVH follow-up indicates a lower recurrence rate as compared with the historical cohort. Improving procedure efficacy while reducing hospital costs is a powerful combination and one that aligns us closely to the needs of our patients, providers and payers. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the time over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2012, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures. During the first quarter, we saw continued strength in U.S. gynecology procedures and Europe dVPs. We also saw strong global general surgery growth and positive U.S. early market reactions to our Single-Site cholecystectomy offering. We are now increasing our 2012 procedure guidance. On our last call, we forecast procedures to grow approximately 24% to 26% from the base of approximately 360,000 procedures performed in 2011. We now forecast full year 2012 da Vinci procedure volume to grow approximately 25% to 27% above our 2011 total. Moving on to revenues. We are also increasing our 2012 revenue guidance. Based upon our higher procedure expectations and revenue contributions from new products, we now expect 2012 revenue to grow between 19% and 21% above total 2011 revenue of $1.76 billion. This is up from 17% and 19% revenue growth forecast on our previous call. Now turning to operating income. Consistent with our previous forecast, we continue to expect operating income to fall within a range of between 39% and 40% of net revenue. We will likely trend towards the lower end of this range as a result of lower gross profit percentages realized on recently launched instrument products. Now turning to noncash expenses. We now expect noncash stock compensation to fall within a range of between $152 million and $156 million for the year compared to our previous forecast of $144 million to $150 million, with the increase driven by higher option valuations associated with our higher stock price. As Marshall described earlier, we would expect noncash stock compensation expense to increase in the second quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the February 15 grant, and to increase further in the third quarter with the August 15 grant. Amortization of purchased intellectual property, which is mostly recorded as R&D expense, is still expected to fall within a range of between $20 million and $24 million in 2012. We expect other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, to total between $15 million and $17 million for the year. With regard to income tax. Our Q1 reported tax rate of 27.2% fell below our guidance range of between 29% and 31%, driven by the release of Section 199 reserves, deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities. Going forward, we expect our tax rate in quarters 2 through 4 to come in at the higher end of our range at around 31% of pretax income. While we will benefit from the ongoing manufacturing activities deduction, we project this benefit will be more than offset by the non-continuance of the U.S. R&D tax credit and a slight shift in our projected geographic mix of pretax profit towards the U.S. We expect that our share count for calculating EPS in Q2 2012 will be approximately 41.2 million shares. Our higher forecasted share count is driven by higher equivalent shares assigned to the diluted share calculation based on our higher stock price. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: A question comes from the line of Spencer Nam with ThinkEquity.
Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: Just a couple of questions here. First of all, you guys mentioned a lot about these new products and these different upgrades having impact on your procedure volume. And I'm curious whether the -- well, whether you guys could tell us how much of the increase in procedure volume is driven by the upgrades and this new capability introduction versus you actually going out and just opening up the new procedure areas that you're currently working on.
Aleks Cukic: Well, I'll answer that the best I can, as I understand it. First off, I don't know that we had necessarily indicated that the new products, i.e. Single-Site and/or the vessel sealer, are the reason for the additional procedure growth, although they did add and contribute to it. The categories of general surgery, which include colorectal surgery, the categories of thoracic surgery, lobectomy, et cetera, in addition to the strong GYN growth and international dVP growth, were really the reasons that drove the added procedure for the quarter. As far as differentiating between new procedures and/or new products, I don't know that we can do that calculation for you. I think, in general, there's good procedure strength that's happening across the core business, specifically dVP outside the United States. dVP in the United States was actually down a little bit, but it was more than made up for in the addition of the other procedures that we talked about.
Operator: And our last question comes on the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Maybe I'll comment on that last point. You talk about active surveillance and the dynamic there in the U.S. Can you just talk about -- I mean, are you expecting dVP to remain flat here? And just talk about watchful waiting and how you think about that impacting this.
Aleks Cukic: Well, I think, in general, we've been talking about dVP being flattish for some time in the United States, for probably the last 3 or 4 quarters. And it's our expectation that, as -- I think you have to almost back away and not look at it as dVP and look at it in general as prostate cancer and the treatment of the disease of prostate cancer and what may happen on a macro level with -- if more people end up going into an active surveillance. And history will tell you that, at some point, something as high as 60% of those men, and it could be as high as 2/3, often wind up in some other therapy, either radiation or surgery, so some of this may be a lead lag effect. We don't really know how to handicap that. I think there's a lot of information that's out there and I think we will probably move up and down with surgery in general. And outside of the United States, again, just to underscore, you're seeing that the overall dVP number is growing, and that is really driven by both European strength as well as Asian and Latin American and other markets.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then can you quantify what the revenues were from Single-Site stocking orders? We've had a few people ask on that.
Marshall L. Mohr: I'm sorry?
Aleks Cukic: Single-Site stocking orders, quantify.
Marshall L. Mohr: We're not going to quantify it. I'd just tell you that, like we said in the script, that the attach rate for Single-Site was reasonable in the quarter. So we're still in the early phases. It's not -- I think, if we gave out numbers now, it really wouldn't be an indication of much.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then last one, on service margins. I think they were at a record this quarter. Just talk about the sustainability of the service margins there and then what's kind of driving the strength.
Marshall L. Mohr: Really, improvements in product quality, reducing the amount of time that our field engineers have to spend servicing the equipment and leveraging than more systems over an existing field service engineer force. It'll fluctuate a little bit here and there, but I think that you've seen the margins over the last few quarters at a certain level and they should continue at that level.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Aleks or Gary, maybe a question for you. If you think about the relative benefits of single-incision cholecystectomy versus lap, is it -- are you seeing enough kind of evidence of that benefit in the early days that convinces you the procedure trajectory is going to be very strong? And just talk a little bit about the selling process and what you're seeing in the initial rollout, if you would.
Gary S. Guthart: You know, I think, on the first part of where the benefits sit, the early anecdotes we're hearing are a combination of benefits on pain and benefits on cosmesis. How these play out over time and what segment of the broader population is interested on those things, just hard to forecast right now, so we'll see.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Gary, are you hearing that that's patient driven or physician driven? Because we've heard some comments that a Single-Site through the umbilicus can actually be more painful in a way than the 4 ports of a typical lap chole.
Gary S. Guthart: Yes, what most -- mostly, what we're hearing is a little bit of both. We hear both the surgeon commentary on it as well as some patient commentary on it, but it's early days. And I think there'll be conflicting opinions for a while until there's a large-enough procedure base and evidence base for to sort out. I'll let Aleks speak to this, on the process.
Aleks Cukic: Again, if you look at the market before we entered into it, I think there were a fair amount of physicians and hospitals that were interested in single-incision surgery, as evidenced by the number of surgeons that were trained and some of the early successes that some of the other companies may have had in that area. So the demand is there in terms -- let's say that the interest level is there. And in terms of the sales process, I think we're seeing a few things converge at the same time: You're seeing general surgeons who have garden-variety procedures like cholecystectomy. At the same time, you're seeing colorectal surgeons who don't necessarily get involved in those type of surgeries, and you're seeing other areas. And we don't talk about them because they're not large markets, but we look at procedures like adrenalectomies and some of the upper-G.I. gastric surgeries, et cetera. They are all on the small end but nice trajectory. So there seems to be a lot of global awareness from the general surgeon that is making it, let's say, easier for our people to get in front of and then consolidate the messaging of robotics programs to include general surgery. So there isn't really any sort of paint-by-numbers here that we can say is consistent other than there's a lot of global awareness in this category they know.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And maybe 2 other quick questions. You talked about Europe placements being weak. What is your outlook for the -- I know it's probably baked into your guidance, but do you think -- do you assume that it gets better, or are you baking it at staying relatively tough even though procedure growth was pretty good? And what are you hearing about the magnitude of hospital budgets relative to procedure capability as they go through the year?
Marshall L. Mohr: A couple of questions in there. I -- we think it will remain pressured for some time to come, so we're not forecasting that the pressure comes off capital budgets. The -- as you said, the procedure side has been reasonably healthy to date. How capital -- or how expenditures reflect back into procedures is really hard for us to handicap. I think we're just going to have to wait and see where that goes.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And then finally, a quick one for Marshall. You talked about gross margin pressure early on with the rollout of SILS and the new products. Is that something we could see resolving over the course of this year? Or maybe it takes a bit longer to get enough scale there?
Marshall L. Mohr: We're not going to put a time frame on it. I'll just say that, like I said in the script, over time, we will -- we are working towards revising our production processes as well as the product itself in driving the cost down.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A couple of quick questions. I want to try to, maybe Aleks or Gary, to rectify the revenue per procedure numbers. Obviously, it's stronger than we would have thought, and you've talked about general surgery being a contributor to incremental growth. So I'm trying to figure out, if general surgery comes on, revenue per procedure should trend down slightly, but in this quarter it trended up and it did contribute to growth. So can you just give us some more granularity on your revenue per procedure going up even though general surgery did contribute to positive growth acceleration?
Marshall L. Mohr: Yes, so when we're selling SILS kits or our single-incision product...
Gary S. Guthart: Or Single-Sites.
Marshall L. Mohr: Yes, Single-Site product. We're -- they're buying it as a kit and they may not have done any surgeries yet, right? And so that's really what is helping increase the revenue per procedure, that, as well as Firefly, as well as thoracic kits. So they're buying instruments and accessories in advance of doing the procedures. Now over time, they'll be doing the procedures and then that will balance out. Long term, I think your question is, is the price that they are paying for single-incision products less than what we're charging for our normal -- our multiple-incision products? And the answer is yes.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So it sounds like, even though the ancillary products, like Firefly, are doing obviously well, you still believe, over time, this trend is going to annualize down.
Aleks Cukic: Yes, yes.
Gary S. Guthart: Over time. It's hard to exactly predict because the mix of new products and the mix of procedures is hard to forecast precisely. And so some of them carry it up and some of them push it down and so you have those 2 trends working in opposition.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Fine. And I know it's early, but is it safe to assume that, in the earliest days of the international general surgery traction, that the majority of this success has been in chole versus other procedures?
Gary S. Guthart: You're seeing really 2 different -- general surgery for us is a tale of 2 different activities. We have strength in colorectal, which is typically cancer procedures that would otherwise have been done open, and so that tends to be one-site. There's a larger volume there. And then we have Single-Site, which is right now approved for cholecystectomy. So you're seeing those 2 things kind of as a barbell. As a total number of procedures, I think you're getting more from colorectal in terms of growth than you have in chole so far.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, very helpful. And just one last quick one and I'll jump back in queue, just in terms of an OUS market dynamic question. If you think about your key markets, maybe Japan is less relevant right now, but in terms of Germany, France, Italy, in those key markets, is prostatectomy still your single biggest growth contributor? So not necessarily absolute, but on a growth perspective, is prostatectomy still the biggest driver in those 3 markets?
Marshall L. Mohr: Yes, the answer is, mostly yes. Although, we're beginning -- there's -- you can see high growth off small bases in a couple of other procedures. So off a substantial base, the dVP is the highest grower. We're beginning to see hysterectomy for cancer condition starting to come up. And there's some interest in general surgery in Italy and that's starting to come up on a lower basis.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Lennox Ketner with Bank of America.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just to go back to the Single-Site product. Our checks suggest you were in probably 20 to 30 hospitals this quarter. I'm just wondering if you're willing to comment on whether that's the right ballpark. And also just wondering, are you still in -- at a point where you're hand-selecting the sites so that you can work with the early adopters? Or is that product developed for broad distribution now?
Aleks Cukic: First, with respect to the number of centers, we really aren't in a position to disclose what those numbers are and we'll probably pass on trying to answer that question. But I would say that, during the course of the quarter, we've seen a lot of interest both in centers that have purchased and have begun doing cases as well as the centers who are in the process of being trained. So comparing and contrasting Single-Site versus the vessel sealer, Single-Site, from a market development standpoint, is much further along than vessel sealing which was a product that we started to phase into -- rollout in the later half of the first quarter. So you should think of those 2 differently: Think of Single-Site being further along and think of Single-Site as a product now that customers can get their hands on.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then you mentioned that it's cleared for broader indications in Europe. Is it cleared for additional specific indications in Europe, or does it -- are you just cleared to use it in anything in Europe?
Gary S. Guthart: It's cleared in most things in the abdomen. It's not cleared in all parts of the body.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, on Japan, sorry if I missed this one. I'm just wondering if you said how many systems were sold into Japan and then also if you could just talk a little bit about what the process is for getting additional procedures approved in Japan. And I know you are kind of, last quarter at least, still debating which procedures to pursue there next, but if you can maybe just talk a little bit about the process there and whether you've made any decisions.
Gary S. Guthart: Sure. So the first question was how many went into Japan this quarter. It was 7. With regard to what happens next in terms of reimbursements, first, we're happy to have the first one under our belt. Going forward, the process changes a little bit and surgical societies are then the groups that lead the pursuit of a reimbursement beyond the first one. And so we'll be in support of the societies as they look to see where they want to go. It's a little bit early to figure out which one will be the next one in the queue, but those societies are interested and they're starting to talk to us about it. And as we know more, then we'll report more in future quarters.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Let me go back to the Europe issues again. Did I hear you correctly that -- part of the issues that you cited and disappointing were the external factors, but some of them, if I understood you, were organizational. And you said you're taking steps to improve. Can you expand on that and give us a little more color on what you're doing and maybe how much of what was disappointing was related to internal versus external issues?
Gary S. Guthart: That's -- it's hard to quantify the differences. You did hear us right. I think there are some things we can do to strengthen our capabilities in Europe. And they tend to be around things like economic support, health technology assessments, marketing, those kinds of market access and structural issues, more than they are a sales process type. So we're working on those things, I think we're making some investments in them. How to distinguish how much is one and how much is the other, very tough to do. We don't know exactly how to do that.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: And so was it sort of a minor factor really this quarter, or if this is something that really could make a significant difference as you address it in the second half, let's say, or...
Gary S. Guthart: It's clear there are economic pressures in Europe having nothing to do with us, and so I think -- and those things are going to exist. How quickly we can add some capabilities and make some changes, that's going to be hard for us to forecast. They're directionally correct and we'll make those investments and progress.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Okay. Two other quick ones. You highlighted the transfer of the da Vinci S license from J&J to you. Is there any economic impact that we should think about or ability to sell or freedom of action that, that helps with that we should understand?
Gary S. Guthart: There is nothing material in terms of a commercial aspect of revenue or cost. What it does allow us to do is move on our timelines and a little more quickly with regard to approvals of future products and the ability to be more responsive in the marketplace. And so that's really the excitement of it for us.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Yes. And a last quick one. You mentioned no stock buybacks in either the fourth quarter or the first quarter. I don't know how to ask it other than rudely: Why not? What are you -- what are the factors that would -- might drive that process?
Gary S. Guthart: I -- Warren Buffet wrote in his shareholder letter something on this point that I thought was great, and I'll just quote it for you. He says he looks for 2 conditions to be satisfied for buy back stock, and I'll quote him: "first, the company has ample funds to take care of the operational and liquidity needs of its business; second, its stock is selling at a material discount, so the company's intrinsic business value, conservatively calculated." I think he said it right. I think we're happy to emulate his behavior there. And that's how we think about it.
Operator: And our last and final question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Yes, so I guess just taking sort of a -- standing back, taking a bigger picture view of things, I guess. First of all, you've got -- hysterectomy is obviously doing extremely well in the U.S. By my math, I think you are kind of getting up to -- upwards of -- in the 50% range now in terms of penetration, and I guess, in another year or 2, that's going to start to peak, I guess. And so where -- what do you really see sort of beyond that to pick up the slack if that really started to slow down, as what we've seen with prostatectomy? Do you think it's really going to be Single-Site? Do you think it's just a combination of a multitude of these other smaller procedures? Do you think it's general surgery? I'd just be interested in getting your thoughts there.
Aleks Cukic: Yes, so it -- think about it this way, Michael: You've got -- if we went back in time in 2005 or so where that question was asked as to, "What are you going to do when U.S. prostatectomy reaches its height?", we weren't talking about hysterectomy. We weren't talking about U.S. hysterectomy, let alone international hysterectomy. We weren't talking about lobectomy. We weren't talking about any of these procedures. Now we're Single-Site and general surgery, in general. So what I -- sort of fast-forward the tape to where we are today. so recognize that dVP U.S. has been flat for some time, let's call it a year, and yet we're growing at a pretty significant rate. Why? Because there are other ways to sort of slice it and look at it internationally. dVP internationally is growing at a very quick rate and it is a larger market than the U.S. dVP market, potentially. Now when you look at dVH, you are talking about the U.S. dVH market which we segmented down to a certain number but it doesn't include non-U.S. geographies. We are continuing to add procedures. And when you add general surgery, whether it be through single-incision or other multiple-incision procedures, and you continue to add thoracic, et cetera, there is plenty for us to do. We don't feel as if we're running out of steam or running out of procedures, but by all means, we feel completely the opposite. So at this stage, it is -- there is plenty on our plate and we think that, over time, we will be adding more things to our plate.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just as sort of a follow-on to that, just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of hysterectomy in Europe and outside the U.S. I mean, you kind of commented on it a little bit earlier in the Q&A, but is there any reason to believe that it might not sort of follow what's happened in the U.S.? I mean, I realize that these procedures probably aren't as common, at least, on a per-capita basis outside the U.S., but is there any reason to believe that, at least for the portion that are done, that we wouldn't see some more adoption curves with time?
Aleks Cukic: Yes, if you look at it from a couple perspectives: One is that dVH is done for a multitude of reasons. It could be endometrial or cervical cancer, ovarian cancer. You move into the benign side and you've got fibroids, multiple fibroids, large fibroids, endometriosis, combination of all the above and normal uterine bleeding, et cetera. So when you try to draw a connection between the way women's health care is performed in the United States or delivered in the United States, it -- and try to compare it to other markets, it's a little bit different, whereas prostatectomy is done for the same reason. They're all done for cancer. Cancer tends to have consistency in a lot of countries: U.S. and OUS. So what our thoughts are at this stage is that, not unlike the United States, we would expect the dVH for malignant conditions to probably be the beachhead, if you will, into most of these countries. And what happens after that, we will have to wait and see. But thus far, the strength that we've seen is consistent with that explanation. So overall, I think you can just take away that women's health care in general, especially for benign conditions, is different in a lot of countries than it is in the United States.
Gary S. Guthart: Thank you. That was the last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flows during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience from Kimberly in Florida gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. "I was diagnosed with vaginal prolapse in November of 2011. I had a hysterectomy 2 years prior, in November of 2009. This is an unfortunate condition caused by several factors such as heredity; number of children, I have 4; and a previous hysterectomy. My gynecologist referred me to Dr. Coyle for the da Vinci procedure due to its minimally invasive nature and, most of all, its high success rate. I researched the procedure, met with Dr. Coyle, discussed it with my family, prayed and decided to schedule the surgery. After years of back pain and discomfort, I was looking forward to some relief. Never did I expect to feel as good as I do today, just 4 weeks post surgery. The first couple of days after the surgery were the hardest, and that was it. After the most -- after that, the most difficult thing was adhering to the post-surgery instructions of what I couldn't do because I felt so good. I never realized how much the nagging pain I'd lived with prior to the procedure was affecting my life. Now I feel so renewed, refreshed and, easily, 10 years younger. I would like to say thank you to Dr. Coyle and his team for their continued pursuit of technological advances in the medical field, their commitment to medical excellence and true compassion for their patient's well-being. I would also like to thank those who created the da Vinci robot for their commitment to these types of advancements in medical technology that make such a positive difference in people's lives. If you're considering this procedure, do yourself a favor and say yes. The outcome is truly worth passing on to others." Patients like Kimberly are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Quarter 4 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Director of Finance for Intuitive Surgical, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's fourth quarter conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights. Then I will provide our financial forecast for 2012. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary S. Guthart: Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2011 has been a productive year at Intuitive. In the past year, our focus was in 4 areas: first, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and urology; second, expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia; third, crisp execution in our product development efforts; and finally, enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral, colorectal and general surgery. We have made substantial progress in the areas above.  Looking first at procedures. In gynecology, hysterectomy procedures grew by approximately 33% over 2010, led by growth in procedures for benign indications in the U.S. In urology, da Vinci Prostatectomy grew by approximately 15% worldwide with most of the growth coming from Europe. Emerging procedure growth was substantive during the year with thoracic surgery and general surgery leading the way followed by head and neck surgery. Clinical results and surgeon interest in these procedures reinforce our conviction in the value of da Vinci surgery in these disciplines. Aleks will take you through greater detail on our procedure performance later in the call.  Internationally, our teams perform well. In the face of economic uncertainty, our European capital team continue to convert the demand for dVP into new system placements. In Asia, we continue to invest into key markets, particularly Korea and Japan. Earlier this month, we acquired our Korean distributor, Biorobotics, and will begin the transition from a distributor market to a direct sales market. Korea is a country that has embraced robotic surgery and whose surgeons have led in creating new techniques. This acquisition allows us to partner with Korean customers more closely in the development of procedures and products to advance the art. We welcome our Korean team to Intuitive. In Japan, customer interest in 2011 remained high despite the earthquake and ensuing tragedy that occurred in March. We have been working diligently on obtaining reimbursement for da Vinci in Japan and are actively engaged with our partners and MHLW.  Our product development and regulatory teams also performed well in 2011. Response to our da Vinci Simulator and our Firefly Fluorescence Imaging system was positive in the year with more than half of our new customers purchasing simulators and with Firefly systems beginning use in several leading centers.  Turning to instruments. We received clearance for our Single-Site instrument and accessory kit for use in cholecystectomy in Q4 2011 and are in the process of a phase rollout. Our first U.S. customers have been completing single-incision cholecystectomy cases and their early reports on outcomes and ease-of-use are encouraging. In December of 2011, we received our FDA clearance for our vessel sealer and we anticipate beginning its phase rollout in this first quarter of 2012. Lastly, we submitted our 510(k) for our da Vinci Stapler late in the fourth quarter.  Looking back at the full year 2011, our operating highlights are as follows. Worldwide procedures grew by approximately 29%. We sold 534 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year, up from 441. Total revenue grew to $1,757,000,000, up 24% over 2010. Recurring revenue grew to $980 million, up 30% and comprising 56% of total revenue. We generated $831 million in operating profit before noncash stock compensation expense, up 24% from last year. And GAAP net income grew to $495 million, up 30% year-over-year.  Now turning to operating highlights for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 27% over the fourth quarter of last year. We sold 152 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 124 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Total revenue for the quarter was $497 million, up 28%. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $196 million, up 30%. We generated an operating profit of $234 million in the quarter before noncash stock compensation expense, up 27% from the fourth quarter of last year. And GAAP net income grew to $151 million, up 25%.  We ended the year with $2,172,000,000 in cash and investments, up $285 million from last quarter and up $563 million from last year. We received $261 million in cash during the year from the exercise of stock options and invested $83 million in fixed assets and intellectual property, $19 million in working capital and equipment and $332 million in stock repurchases for the year. Going forward, we will continue to look for stock repurchase opportunities. Gross cash from operations for the year were $737 million, which is 149% of our reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of the significant noncash stock option and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason that we believe that gross cash generated from operations remains the best measure of our financial performance.  We added 79 people to our team predominantly in our clinical sales force, our design and operations functions in Q4, bringing our total team to 1,924 employees. Looking to 2012, our priorities are as follows: first, continuing our growth in gynecology and urology worldwide through outstanding execution in the field; second, disciplined execution of our Single-Site and vessel sealing launches focused on outstanding early customer experiences; third, building robust clinical programs with leading customers and emerging procedures in general surgery, thoracic surgery and transoral surgery; and finally, strengthening our capabilities in international markets, particularly Europe, Japan and Korea.  I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer, to take us through our financial performance in greater detail.
Marshall L. Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our fourth quarter revenue was $497 million, up 28% compared with $389 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and up 11% compared with $447 million reported for the third quarter of 2011. Fourth quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Fourth quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $196 million, up 30% compared with $151 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, and up 12% compared with $176 million in the third quarter of 2011. Year-over-year, instrument and accessory revenue growth was driven by procedure growth of 27% and initial purchases of recently launched products, including our Firefly and thoracic instrument set. Quarter-over-quarter growth was primarily driven by higher fourth quarter stocking orders associated with higher fourth quarter system unit sales.  Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders of approximately $1,975 per procedure, was higher than the $1,940 realized in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the $1,950 achieved in the third quarter of 2011. Over time, we expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base. This natural decline has been more than offset in recent quarters by the positive impact of our new instrument and accessory product. However, instrument and accessory revenue per procedure will fluctuate based on product and procedure mix as well as the rate of adoption of newer products.  Fourth quarter 2011 systems revenue of $225 million increased 27% compared with $178 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010 and increased 13% compared with $199 million of systems revenue for the third quarter of 2011. Our higher fourth quarter 2011 systems revenue was driven by higher system unit sales and increased average selling prices. We sold 152 systems in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with 124 systems in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 133 systems in the third quarter of 2011. The fourth quarter of 2011 system count included 50 systems involving trade-in comprised of 23 standard systems and 27 da Vinci Ss. During the third quarter of 2011, 35 systems involved trade-ins comprised of 14 standard systems and 21 da Vinci Ss. In the fourth quarter of 2010, 33 systems involved trade-in comprised of 24 standard systems and 9 da Vinci Ss. Upgrade revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 was approximately $2 million compared with $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $5 million for the third quarter of 2011.  Our fourth quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades, was $1.47 million, an increase from the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2010 and a slight increase compared with the $1.46 million realized in the third quarter. The increase in average sales price relative to the fourth quarter of 2010 reflects a higher proportion of dual consoles in surgical simulators and Firefly-enabled systems, both of which were introduced in the current year, partially offset by an increase in the number of da Vinci S trade-in. The increase in ASPs relative to the third quarter reflect a higher proportion of simulators and Firefly-enabled systems, partially offset by a proportionally lower mix of dual consoles and increased da Vinci S trade-in. We sold 29 dual console systems in the fourth quarter 2011 compared to 16 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 29 in the third quarter of 2011. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix as well as foreign exchange rates on sales made in European currency.  Service revenue increased to $75 million, up 24% compared with $61 million last year and up 5% compared with $72 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total fourth quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $272 million, up 28% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 and up 10% compared with the third quarter of 2011. Recurring revenue represented 55% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 54% in the fourth quarter last year and 55% last quarter.  International results were as follows. Fourth quarter 2011 procedures outside of the United States grew approximately 28% compared with fourth quarter of 2010 and 34% compared with the third quarter of 2011. dVP in Europe was the greatest driver of o U.S. procedure growth. We also experienced growth in dVH for malignant conditions in Europe. o U.S. procedures grew slower than previous quarters in part reflecting cost control efforts in certain European market and a decline in the Korean market. On January 11, we completed the purchase of our Korean distributor. The purchase price and the impact of the acquisition on 2012 income is not expected to be material. The acquisition will enable closer relationships with our Korean customers and increase focus on procedure adoption.  Fourth quarter revenue outside of the United States was $107 million, up 12% compared with revenue of $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and up 13% compared with revenue of $94 million in the third quarter of 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue outside of the United States grew 34% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. We sold 39 systems outside of the United States this quarter compared with 38 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 34 last quarter. Aleks will provide additional details of overseas system sales.  Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Our gross margin in the fourth quarter was 73%, consistent with 73% for the fourth quarter of 2010 and 73% for the third quarter of 2011. Fourth quarter operating expenses of $163 million were up 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 and up 11% compared with the third quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects higher variable costs associated with increased revenue, higher engineering project costs and costs associated with employees added during the quarter. We added 79 employees in the quarter, including 30 employees in product operations and 31 employees in commercial operations. Fourth quarter 2011 operating income was $200 million or 40% of sales compared with $154 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $179 million or 40% of sales for the third quarter of 2011. Fourth quarter 2011 operating income reflects $35 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $30 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $35 million last quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 26% brought our annual tax rate to just over 30% compared to an annual tax rate of 33% last year. The decrease in the annual rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings and lower state taxes. The change from the third quarter reflects lower state taxes and changes in our estimates of foreign versus U.S. income. Our net income was $151 million or $3.75 per share compared with $121 million or $3.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $122 million or $3.05 per share for the third quarter of 2011.  Let me quickly summarize our results for 2011. Procedures grew by 29%. Total revenue for 2011 was $1.76 billion, up 24% compared with $1.41 billion last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth, 30%, and an increase in systems revenue of 18%. Operating income for 2011 was $695 million, up 25% compared with $555 million last year. Operating income included $136 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2011 compared with $118 million in 2010. Net income for 2011 was $495 million or $12.32 per share compared with $382 million or $9.47 per share last year. Gross cash flows from operations for 2011 totaled $737 million compared with $573 million last year.  Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended 2011 with cash and investments of $2.17 billion, up $285 million compared with September 30, 2011. The increase was driven by $209 million of gross cash flows from operation plus $79 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $15 million of capital and IP purchases. During the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any of our common stock. However, we remain committed to exercising the remaining board authorized buybacks of $568 million. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $298 million at December 31 from $265 million at September 30, primarily reflecting the higher impact of fourth quarter revenues. Our net inventory increased to $112 million at December 31 from $109 million at September 30. Our higher inventory reflects our business growth and expanded product offering.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the fourth quarter, we sold 152 da Vinci systems; 113 in the United States, 23 into Europe and 16 into rest of world markets. As part of the 152 system sales, 23 standard da Vinci systems and 27 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We had a net 101 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2,132 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide; 1,548 in the U.S., 372 in Europe and 212 in rest of world markets. 82 of the 152 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 144 of the 152 systems sold represented da Vinci Si systems, which included 29 dual console systems. The 39 system sales internationally included 5 into Japan, 5 into France and 4 into the countries of Germany and Russia.  As mentioned in the past, Q4 tends to provide seasonal strength for da Vinci system sales, most notably in the U.S. While international da Vinci sales were solid, the EU macroeconomic environment remained choppy. Clinically, we had a strong quarter, achieving an overall year-over-year procedure growth rate of approximately 27%. Gynecology and general surgery growth was particularly strong; while urology, most notably international dVP growth, was robust. Within GYN, strong growth took place across the board. The 9 dVH sacrocolpopexy, myomectomy and endometrial resections were up sharply. General surgery growth was also strong within several procedure subcategories, including G.I. surgery and cholecystectomy.  During the quarter, nearly 300 abstracts and papers representing a variety of surgical specialties were published within various peer reviewed journals, while the clinical conferences were abundant with why da Vinci procedure transmissions, postgraduate robotic courses, podium presentations and clinical poster sessions. While our FDA clearance for Single-Site is brand-new, we've had the product selectively available in Europe for the past few quarters. The initial European response has been favorable with early clinical reports beginning to make their way into the clinical journals. In a recent edition of the journal, Surgical Endoscopy, Dr. Spinoglio and Lenti from Alessandria, Italy published a comparative analysis entitled, Single-Site Robotic Cholecystectomy Versus Single-Incision Lap Chole: A Comparison of Learning Curves. In the publication, they described how technical constraints, such as instrument collisions, lack of triangulation and cross-handing has hampered the SILS approach from fully emerging. They described how using a robotic platform may overcome these problems and enable more precise surgical actions by increasing freedom of movement and by restoring intuitive instrument control. In their study, performed under institutional controls, the surgeons compared the results of their first 25 Single-Site cases to their first 25 single-incision lap choles and followed up each patient 2 months postoperatively. The result showed consistency between the 2 patient groups when it came to wound complications where neither group experienced wound infections or incisional hernias. Length of hospitalization was reduced slightly within the Single-Site cohort. However, the most striking difference between the 2 groups was the operative time to perform the procedure. They published that the operative time was significantly reduced using Single-Site as compared to the manual single-incision approach. Average operative time was 83.2 minutes with the SILS approach compared to 62.7 minutes with Single-Site. Their conclusion was and I quote, "Our preliminary experience shows that Single-Site robotic chole is safe, can easily be learned and performed in a reproducible manner and is faster than single-incision lap chole."  We continue to experience general surgery procedure strength across several subcategories, cholecystectomy among them. Going forward, we anticipate general surgery playing a more prominent role within our overall procedure mix. While not a primary target, the conversion from laparoscopic hysterectomy to dVH has been taking place within a number of practices. These conversions have not been isolated to any particular pathological segment, meaning that we have seen conversions take place within both benign and malignant treatment pathways. Surgeons have provided various reasons for converting lap cases to dVH, most of which relate to the expansion of MIS technique across a wider spectrum of patients. But a recent study published in the journal, Gynecologic Oncology, provides a new postoperative cost savings argument. The study authored by Drs. Martino and Shubella was entitled, A Cost Analysis of Postoperative Management in Endometrial Cancer Patients Treated by Robotics Versus Laparoscopic Approach. The study retrospectively collected cost data from 215 patients, 101 dVHs and 114 lap hyst patients where all surgeries were performed by gynecologic oncologists. Demographic data, patient recorded pain scores, pain management interventions and post operative pain medication costs were compared. They reported that robotic patients had a lower number of initial drug interventions as well as a lower number of total drug interventions than laparoscopic patients. Robotic patients also had a lower initial pain score. There was a 50% reduction in the pain medication cost on the day of surgery for robotic patients and a 56% cost reduction for the rest of their length of stay. The author's conclusion and I quote, "Endometrial cancer patients, who have robotic surgery experience, less initial postoperative pain and have fewer drug interventions, the cost associated for their pain management represents a savings of greater than 50%. These factors demonstrate the value of robotic surgery in regard to postoperative pain management by delivering higher-quality care at a lower cost."  Drs. Magrina and Zanagnolo from the Mayo Clinic of Scottsdale published a study in the European Journal of Gynecologic Oncology entitled, Robotic Surgery for Endometrial Cancer: A Comparison of Perioperative Outcomes and Recurrences with Laparoscopy, Vaginal Laparoscopy and Laparotomy. The method of study was a prospective analysis of 67 patients undergoing robotic surgery for endometrial cancer as compared to 37 laparoscopic hysterectomies, 99 laparotomy approaches and 47 vaginal laparoscopic combination procedures. They reported that the mean operating times for patients undergoing these 4 techniques was pretty similar. But mean blood loss differed significantly; 141 milliliters for robotic patients, 300 milliliters for lap patients, 300 milliliters for vag lap patients and 472 milliliters for open laparotomy. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.9 days in the robotic cohort, 3.4 days for lap patients, 3.5 days for vaginal lap patients and 5.6 days for their laparotomy patients. There were no significant differences in intra or postoperative complications among the 4 groups. The conversion rate was 2.9% for robotics compared to 10.8% for the laparoscopy group. Their conclusion and I quote, "Robotics, laparoscopy and vaginal laparoscopy techniques are preferable to laparotomy for suitable patients with endometrial cancer. Robotics is preferable to laparoscopy due to a shorter hospital stay and lower conversion rate and preferable to vaginal laparoscopy due to reduced hospitalization."  Late adopters of urologic robotic surgery have, from time to time, issued critiques based purely on a structural academic point of view, citing little prospective randomized data comparing dVP to open prostatectomy. And since powering a large study with enough men willing to be randomized into the open surgery cohort is both difficult and unlikely, we have relied on the large body of clinical evidence that has been drawn from quality institutions around the world. This month, 2 more very large studies were published in the journal, European Urology. Each study was comprised of 5-digit national samples, but for sake of time, I'll highlight only one. The study was entitled, Perioperative Outcomes of Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Compared with Open Radical Prostatectomy: Results from an Inpatient Sample. It originated out of the Vattikuti Urology Institute at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and included authorship support from several other leading centers. The study, which included over 19,000 prostatectomy patients, compared the rates of blood transfusions, intraoperative and postoperative complications, prolonged length of stay and in-hospital mortality between 7,400 open prostatectomies and 11,900 dVP patients. In the comparison, the authors reported that the percentage of men requiring blood transfusions was approximately 3.5x greater for men undergoing an open prostatectomy as compared to dVP. The percentage of men experiencing intraoperative complications was over 2x greater for open prostatectomy. Postoperative complications were approximately 25% higher in the open prostatectomy group. Length of stay, prolonged length of stay and in-hospital mortality was found to be higher within the open prostatectomy group. The authors summarized their conclusion by stating and I quote, "Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy has supplanted open prostatectomy as the most common surgical approach for radical prostatectomy. Moreover, we demonstrate superior adjusted perioperative outcomes after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy in virtually all examined outcomes."  This concludes my remarks, so I'll now turn the time over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with our financial forecast for 2012, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows.  Starting with procedures. We continue to see strong growth in U.S. da Vinci gynecologic procedures and dVPs in Europe and general growth across a broadening range of procedures at early stages of adoption -- earlier stages of market adoption. We expect our 2012 total procedures to grow approximately 24% to 26% from the base of approximately 360,000 procedures performed in 2011. Based on an increasing percentage of benign hysterectomies and other short-term elective procedures in our procedure mix, we anticipate a more pronounced quarterly seasonality impact in 2012 as compared to 2011.  Moving on to revenues. We expect to achieve annual revenue growth of between 17% and 19%. We expect typical capital sales seasonality in 2012 with the proportion of full year system units sold in each quarter to follow a pattern consistent with 2011. We would expect fewer systems to be sold in the upcoming seasonally slower first quarter than in the recently completed seasonally stronger fourth quarter. All 2012 revenues, particularly capital sales in Europe, are subject to the impacts of uncertain economic conditions.  Now turning to operating income. Our 2011 operating income was 39.5% of revenue and it was 39.3% of revenue in 2010. For 2012, we would expect our operating income profile to remain fairly consistent with the past 2 years falling within a range of between 39% and 40% of revenue for the year. Consistent with prior years, we would expect our operating income as a percentage of revenue to be lower in the first quarter of 2012, reflecting system sales and procedure seasonality in combination with the more linear operating expense growth pattern. We expect our noncash stock compensation charges to increase from $136 million recorded in 2011 to approximately $144 million to $150 million in 2012. Amortization of purchased intellectual property, which is mostly recorded as R&D expense, is expected to increase from $18 million in 2011 to a range between $20 million and $24 million in 2012. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income was approximately $15 million in 2011. We expect other income to be approximately flat within a range of between $13 million and $15 million in 2012. With regard to income tax, in 2011, we recorded an income tax rate at approximately 30% of pretax income. Going forward, we would expect the 2012 income tax rate to remain around that rate, between a range of 29% and 31% of pretax income. We estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 2012 will be approximately 40.5 million shares.  That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Ben Andrew representing William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I'm curious. You had a lot of activity going with all the single-incision approval, purchase of the Korean distributor, closing on Japanese reimbursement approval and it looked like you stepped up hiring in the fourth quarter to support some of that. Talk a little bit about the strategy going direct in Korea and how material event that could be. What does your organization look like in Japan now and what it may look like? And presumably, a lot of that is already contemplated into your operating margin guidance. So is there a chance that maybe we see a bigger investment as the year goes on that could -- that would push you towards the lower end of the range that Calvin just gave us?
Gary S. Guthart: A few questions embedded in there, but I'll start with Korea. Our view of Korea is that -- has a lot to do with being close to our Korean customer to help develop the next generation of procedures of general surgical procedures. We don't see it so much as being a big swing financially one way or the other but really an opportunity to be with some leading groups and be close to them, and it's something that we have contemplated for a little while and are excited to get started with. On the Japan side, most of our investment this past year have really been in regulatory and kind of back office support work getting ready to take on reimbursement and some of the other things we want to do with regard to building out that market. And we expect more of the same this year. I don't think I would forecast high or low end of the range based on that set of activities that we're going to do. I think Calvin's range that he described accurately represents where we're going to wind up.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then as you think about ramping single incision, obviously, that's a new approval for you guys. There's some iteration to do on the instruments and some experience to gain, perhaps. Over what time frame do you think that, that can become material to the business? Is that really a 2013 where you're talking maybe 5s or 10s of thousands of procedures? Or is that something achievable in '12 because obviously it's a large opportunity and the instrument set's early. And I know you're collecting experience in Europe. But just how do you think about that? And being a different call point, does that require a different sales force or just to get another duty for your already very busy sales organization?
Aleks Cukic: Dan, it's Aleks. And I'll take a cut at it and Gary can fill in anything that I leave blank. I think as a general matter, when we think of procedure launches or product launches that are really tied to a specific procedure, we have a set of activities that is requisite, really irrespective of the specialty. And that is getting the procedure up and running with key opinion leaders, making sure that you understand the nuances of the procedure, understanding what the training pathway is going to look like, setting up your proctors, embedding it into basic sales training for your large downstream organization, making sure you've got instrument optimization and so on and so forth. Unlike a, let's say, a pharmaceutical clearance where doctors basically fill out prescription pads and you can be off and running pretty quick, it requires a lot of work. So when we think about it in terms of is it going to be a material number in 2011 or is it 2012, we're really not that focused on it. The market is going to be there if we approach it well. And so we're more interested in really doing it well in the front end and give us a couple of quarters to sort of sort through that, and we'll probably have a better answer for you in the near future.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And just circling back, Gary, on one, that on the sales rep hiring, it does look like the headcount picked up more like the trajectory we saw several quarters ago. Was that an artifact or was that the distributor? Is that kind of more just again in support of this and we should expect to see that sustained over the course of '12?
Calvin Darling: So just in terms of the numbers, I'll fill those in and let Gary comment further. So we ended the quarter with roughly 565 clinical salespeople and 85 capital sales in the field. So what that results in was about 20 clinical adds and 5 capital for the year -- or for the quarter, sorry, which would bring our full year clinical adds to 90 and 15 on the capital side. So that's really more of a return to a pattern of hiring consistent with the system installations or the adds to the installed base that we've seen historically. You may recall in 2011 -- or 2010, we invested heavily in the field organization. In that year, we had 150 when we took it from 315 to 465. So here, we're back to a more status quo level.
Gary S. Guthart: Just to add a little, there's a couple of things in here that are a little bit of timing where we tend to want to bring in sales reps on the early side for the year and get them into training, and you do see the addition of the Korean team into the groups.
Operator: And next we'll go to the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I'm wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on Europe. Your commentary there on Europe in the quarter was a little bit mixed. I'm just wondering, you brought up, I think, something like the cost control initiatives. So can you just talk a little bit more on the dynamics in the European market?
Gary S. Guthart: Sure. So what we saw in the -- in the European market, what we saw was that hospitals are cautious about what they're spending. And we understand that they're given fixed budgets and that they may have run through those fixed budgets and, therefore, didn't serve all of the patients that maybe they otherwise would have. We'll see in Q1. We don't know. The market is not predictable at this point and we'll see how it pans out.
Aleks Cukic: Yes. I think also, just to add, Tycho, is that when you look at the 23 systems that were sold in Europe and you're looking at the connection between procedures and system sales, really the strength of urology and namely dVP is really moving rapidly in certain markets. And you've heard us call out Germany quarter after quarter where they've had a pretty strong performance in Germany. And you're hearing a couple of new markets like Russia, and France has been pretty strong for the past few quarters. So we're pleased with the adoption of that, but it just becomes very difficult to predict which country is going to be able to close, which system and in which 90-day period.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then I guess maybe just shifting to new products. First of all, with the vessel sealer, can you talk about how you see the opportunity between general surgery and colorectal? And I think you've talked about lung and some other areas. And then also, are you willing to put a guess on when you'll get the Stapler out now that you filed?
Aleks Cukic: As far as vessel sealer, the way we think about that, if you look at the standard toolkit for a surgeon, be it general surgery, GYN oncology, thoracic surgery and more specifically, colorectal within general, a vessel sealer capable of taking larger vessels is usually in the armamentarium. Now with da Vinci today, we have the ability -- our customers have the ability to tie off large vessels, they can clip them. We have monopolar and bipolar, which usually goes into smaller vessels. We have the Endo PK device. So we have a number of tools but what has been missing is an integrated vessel sealer. So when we again think about it and where it's going to go, we know it's used in conjunction with da Vinci procedures across the board. When I say across the board, including general surgery and GYN, oncology and other areas. So we think that the choreography of giving them the ability to fire it from the system without having to get up or having the system fire it is going to add value. Where and how and how many, again, give us a few quarters to sort that out. It is a disposal product. We plan to roll it out this quarter. We've got our clearances. We will be cautious and make sure we set up the right sites and the work through it diligently as we do it with any other large product launch.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then on the Stapler?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes. On the stapler, we're feeling good about the product. On the other hand, trying to handicap exactly when we'll get through the clearance process we're not ready to do.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just one last one, following up on that. As we think about overall R&D spend, how do you feel about R&D levels? As you come off 2011, could we start to see R&D leverage at some point going forward? Or how do we think about that?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes, it's been lumpy and you saw some lumpiness in the fourth quarter. A little bit of what drove that lumpiness coming in, a little bit of acceleration in the fourth quarter were really 2 things. Some of it was just prototype timing. Those things aren't always smooth quarter-to-quarter. And a little bit of it was some of the things that we were asked to do for FDA clearances, and that brought it up a little bit. So I think it will be -- in profile it will hold about the same profile. It may be lumpy, though. It may not come in smoothly all the way through the year.
Operator: Our next question today comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: This is Jon Demchick, in for David. We had a question on revenue per procedure trends. Over the last few quarters, we've seen a lot of progress with Intuitive's pipeline; adding Single-Site, the vessel sealer Firefly, suction irrigation, et cetera. These new tools have continued to help revenue per procedure stay in the mid-1,900s now moving up a little from there. As these instruments gain a little further traction, how do you expect revenue per procedure to trend? And also, do you expect to continue to introduce new products at the current rate that you have been over the past few quarters?
Calvin Darling: Yes. Jon, it's Calvin here. Yes, you correctly pointed it out. I think, as Marshall stated in our prepared comments, over a long period of time, we'd expect that the revenue per procedure would gradually trend down as the stocking order impact becomes lesser impactful on a larger installed base. But in recent quarters, as you correctly point out, some of our new product offerings, like Firefly and our 8.5-millimeter scope and our thoracic toolkit, the initial stocking of those new products has also served to kind of offset that national decline and we've kind of held it around the mid-1,900s. So now looking forward into 2012, which is your question, I guess there's forces moving it in either direction, including the timing of the stocking orders, international rate fluctuations, exchange rates, I mean, and new products, and particularly how successful we are with some of the new products that we have talked earlier, which we're just not really in a position to handicap that perfectly how much impact it will have. So really, it could go either way at this point.
Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the procedure guidance. So we were wondering if you could give any clarity to some of the assumptions behind that guidance at around 25% for year 2012 for both hysterectomies and for o U.S. prostatectomies. We were wondering if you were kind of assuming procedure growth in line above or below your total procedure guidance?
Gary S. Guthart: So the major drivers of a procedure -- procedure growth next year, we still expect to be in the gynecologic area in U.S. and dVP in Europe. We haven't profiled how much we think each one of those is going to grow next year, but those assumptions of those 2 areas driving the growth are embedded in our total projection.
Aleks Cukic: And also, strength in the emerging procedures that we've talked about in the general surgery or thoracic surgery and some of the other areas. So we're pretty careful about the makeup of the projected growth and we've thought through it pretty clearly.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tao Levy of Collins Stewart.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division: A question on the procedure growth rate in the fourth quarter of -- was that a -- mainly, the slowdown versus the growth rates that we saw throughout the first 3 quarters of 2011, that was mainly Europe, is that kind of correct?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes, we felt pretty good about our procedure performance through the year in the U.S. We saw some pressure in Europe right at the very end of the fourth quarter and a little bit out of Asia. Different things going on there. In Europe, it looks to be more anecdotes come back, pointing more to economic pressure. In Asia, it's really getting some of the structural issues resolved in Japan and in Korea.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division: Got you. And general surgery, I think, Aleks, you made a comment that expect that to play a bigger role going forward. And can you talk a little bit more or expand a little bit more into what areas, what type of penetration you expect to get to in this segment? And at least in your prior investor presentations, general surgery was mainly made up of colorectal. I mean, you're talking a little bit more about gallbladders being -- having grown nicely in the quarter. And I was just wondering how that fits into the long-term picture.
Aleks Cukic: Yes, so if you look at general surgery, there's obviously a number of ways to cut it. But I think for sake of the question, think of it in terms of G.I., gastrointestinal, made up mostly of the colon. So you've got right colon, transverse colon, you have descending, left colon, sigmoid, low anterior resections, et cetera. We have a nice emerging business there with good solid growth rates. It's off a small base, but we're hearing from customers that there is a lot of value to this procedure, a procedure that they have been doing in small numbers laparoscopically over the past 15 to 20 years. We think we can add some value there. A device, such as the vessel sealer, will be helpful to that cohort of physicians and customers. So we -- you can envision us spending more time there, more sales interactions, et cetera, whereas Single-Site is specific to lap chole. And so as we look at 2011 and compare it to, let's say, projected 2012 activity, you now have a number of exciting areas with higher value offerings to your customer. And so we're going to refrain from trying to give guidance in terms of what we think our penetration will be or by when because we're really focused on doing the right things at the front end to seed this market. The market isn't going anywhere. We will do it right. And so as we get a few more quarters into it, perhaps at that point, we can elaborate more deeply.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division: Okay. If I could just sneak one more in. Japan reimbursement, Gary, I think you mentioned that you may continue to make progress over there. So is it fair to say that you have not gotten reimbursement for prostate in Japan yet?
Gary S. Guthart: So we're in conversation, but we have not had a definitive conversation at this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lennox Ketner with Bank of America.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: One, just if we could just return to Europe quickly. I was wondering if you can maybe characterize kind of what you saw throughout the quarter. The weakness that you're talking about, did that just manifest towards the very end of the quarter? Or was that kind of consistent throughout the quarter?
Gary S. Guthart: Thought it increased through quarter is the right way to view it. I think though, it's not a deep, deep analysis. But anecdotally, you saw some increased pressure as the quarter wore on.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then on the Single-Site launch, is it possible -- I know Aleks was talking about kind of all of the work that's involved in the early stages of the launch and then will be fairly gradual. But is there any way to kind of just qualitatively compare it to the European launch? I know you're in kind of 10 to 15 sites in Europe in the first year. How should we think about the U.S. launch? Can you -- do you feel like you can be in twice as many sites? How -- if there's any way to kind of compare it to the European launch in terms of the scope, that would be helpful.
Aleks Cukic: I think, structurally, when I say structurally, we'll go through the same process of picking the right centers. But I don't think you should think of it being materially larger or materially smaller than the initial launch that we had outside the United States. So it is something that will be carefully scripted in making sure we have the right centers. And obviously, our sales and marketing people have a list of people that they are working with now, and we'll keep it in that domain and eventually add more centers. And as we have more learning, roll it out fully at some point.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then I apologize if you answered this earlier, but are you guys planning to hire additional sales people for that product or to have the sales people specialize there? Or will it just be sold by your general sales force?
Gary S. Guthart: We have a small team who will help focus on Single-Site as it comes out and as it goes in the early phases, they'll be focused on that effort. As it gets a little bit broader, then it will work down into the rest of the organization.
Operator: And we have a question from Rick Wise representing Leerink Swann.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Let me come back to Korea. First, a broader question. Are there other international distributors to convert, one? And, two, I mean, I know that Korea has been a hotbed of a robotic activity, can you give us any flavor for how big it is relative to international sales or total sales? And where I'm going is -- and it would seem to me that as you convert from a distributor to direct that you'd realize higher ASPs, which all things equal should be helpful to a system pricing, all things equal, in 2012.
Aleks Cukic: First of all, Rick, as far as the -- kind of scoping it for you, Korea, I believe, through the end of the year has 36 da Vinci placements. And if you look at the things that are being done within the busy Korean centers, you'll see things like a lot of thyroid work, colorectal work, certainly urologic work. And some pretty advanced efforts into things like gastric and other G.I. cancers. Now as far as the overall procedures, we haven't broken out any individual country by procedure numbers. But you could -- you can envision it, I think, fairly accurately by thinking of a 36-system market that has a lot of activity going on. As far as other distributors, to my knowledge, and perhaps Marshall or Calvin can correct me if I'm wrong, the only other one that I'm aware of that we took from distributor to direct in recent memory has been the U.K. And so we've done it before. And Gary gave the reasons why Korea is an interesting market for us.
Gary S. Guthart: And that was a few years ago. Basically, we monitor the performance of all the distributors and make decisions as we go and so...
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: So there could be others in the future. Turning to gross margins, did I miss it? Or did you not give a specific gross margin for cash for 2012? Any reason to assume anything other than the sort of stable performance we have seen?
Calvin Darling: Yes. So the guidance on this, we kind of truncated the gross margin and the operating expenses to come to an overall operating profit. That again, we guided to something relatively flat on a profile basis between 39% and 40% there. Splitting it out, roughly flat is probably reasonable. If it goes one way or another, we'd probably see maybe a little more downward pressure on the gross margins as we're introducing some of the new products and maybe a slight bit of leverage on the operating expenses. But again, focusing on the operating income, we're signaling pretty flat.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Yes, and then 2 last ones. Just back to Japan reimbursement, I'm not sure what this means, but I've read something that says that the government has certified the da Vinci system is "highly advanced medical technology" for prostate cancer operations, allowing patients to use health insurance. Can you just -- any color around that, what's that about?
Gary S. Guthart: I haven't seen the specific publication that you're talking about, so I really can't comment it on the call.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Okay. And just a last quick one, if I could. And just sort of a fishing expedition, somebody asked me a question about patents. And last time we met, Marshall or maybe it was Gary, you said you have 1,000 patents or so now, 1,000 in the pipeline and just big numbers. Are there any key expirations that we should be sensitive to coming up in the next 12 to 24 months?
Gary S. Guthart: On the patent side, it's a sliding window. So as things mature, some things will fall off and other things get added. It's not huge numbers that falloff at any one time. And so as you go through kind of a detailed analysis, some will start coming off in future years as you'd expect. And we feel like the kinds of things that we're innovating on, and are obtaining patent coverage for either through organic work or through end licensing, will be important for our products and important to our customers.
Operator: Our final question today then will come from the line of Spencer Nam with Think Equity.
Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: Just couple of quick questions. On the multisystem, the places, locations, if you will. Last quarter, you had provided some color on that. Could you give us a little more color on what the current multisystem location numbers would be?
Aleks Cukic: Yes. Spencer, I believe it's -- and Calvin can correct me. I think it's 306 at the end of this quarter. And now we have a hospital. I think the Mayo Clinic in Rochester is now up to 7 systems. So that would be the highest in any one hospital. And again, then there's a smattering of few hospitals with 6 and 5 and 4 all the way down to those.
Calvin Darling: For our total installed base of 2,132, they're spread across 1,718 sites.
Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. And then the -- in terms of these trade-ins with standards and Ss, how many of those are left out there? Can you guys -- do you guys have an estimate on that?
Calvin Darling: Yes. So on the standard side, we've got roughly 225 still remaining out in the field, of which about 100 are in the U.S. then on...
Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: And then final question is, in terms of the customers who are picking up systems now, are they still focusing on prostatectomy and hysterectomy for the initial purchase, if you will? Or is it more broad nowadays that you guys have focused on a broad number of procedures out there?
Aleks Cukic: I think the answer is both or all of what you described. You can imagine if you do not own a single da Vinci system today that there is going to be support from a urologic group that has by -- by any count had some loss of patient volume. And GYN is growing at a pretty rapid rate. You are now starting to see other specialties or I should say you've been seeing other specialties, perhaps thoracic or general surgery to colorectal. Now with Single-Site, it will be interesting to see how some of those physicians weigh into the decision. But it is -- should be and has been considered a multi-specialty initiative, and that's the way our salespeople approach it.
Gary S. Guthart: That was our last question. As we've discussed with you over the years, while we spend our time on these calls reviewing our financial performance, our team remains sharply focused on the creation of patient value, improving the efficacy of surgery while reducing its invasiveness. I'd like to share with you a brief example of what this means in the lives of our patients. I'd like to share with you Cleave's story. "I'm 51 years old. I was hurting in my lower stomach for a few months. I started passing a little blood, so my family said it was time to go to the doctor. So I went to see my regular doctor. And he said, "You're 50, it's time to get a colonoscopy." So December 19, I had my colonoscopy. He told me there was a mass, and I wasn't sure you know that lingo, and he said it will be cancer. So the ball started rolling. Immediately, they referred me to an oncologist. We went in and we met with him, and he said he would be cutting me from the breastbone down and then over and then open me up. There would be 2 surgeons, 4 hands inside working. He said I would lose several pints of blood and that they may dislocate my pelvic bones. And when he started talking like this, I'm like, this doesn't sound right, this is too much. I've got too many years left, I don't like the odds. Meanwhile, my daughter was doing research. We were like, well, we see this da Vinci thing. We looked at the videos on the Internet, and we were like let's go talk to this guy. So we went to Dr. Hoss' [ph] office and he said, "Yes, we can do this." I said, "About how much blood are we talking about losing here?" He said, "Blood's not an issue." He said, "You're a young guy. I'm going to do everything I can." So I came out of it. He took 12 to 13 inches of bowel out and put everything back together. My healing, as far as the procedure itself, my incisions and stuff, they healed up well. I've seen some people who've been cut, they get infections. And this was a scary thing for me, too, because I have a lot of years left. I've got a lot of stuff to do. And I think I've made a good decision." Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci Surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving a vital few things that truly make a difference.  This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q3 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's Third Quarter Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com, on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights. Then I'll provide you with an update to our financial guidance for 2011. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary S. Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with the growth in da Vinci procedures and with the performance of our capital and clinical teams in the third quarter. Overall, the Intuitive team is executing well in our 4 2011 focus areas, which are first, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and urology; second, expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia; third, crisp execution in our product development efforts; and finally, enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral, colorectal and general surgery. Total procedures grew approximately 30% over Q3 2010 with strong year-over-year growth in gynecology. Gynecology procedure performance was solid for all of our target procedures, including hysterectomy for malignant and benign conditions, sacrocolpopexy and myomectomy. In urology, da Vinci Prostatectomy continued to grow year-over-year driven by European uptick. dVP was flat in the quarter on a sequential basis, expected given the summer seasonal slowdown in Europe.  For follow-on procedures in urology, our penetration into treatment for kidney cancer continues to grow as more total nephrectomies are converting to nephron-sparing partial nephrectomies enabled by da Vinci. Emerging procedures in thoracic surgery and colorectal surgery continued to show strength both sequentially and year-over-year.  Transoral robotic surgery grew nicely on a year-over-year basis, however, absolute volumes in TORS are relatively small and quarter-to-quarter variation is significant. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. Operating highlights for the third quarter are as follows: Procedures grew approximately 30% over the third quarter of 2010. We sold 133 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 105 during the third quarter of last year, 99 of which were purchased by U.S. customers.  Total revenue was $447 million, up 30% over last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $176 million, up 38% over Q3 of 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $248 million, up 34% from prior year and comprising 55% of total revenue. Net income was $122 million, up 41% over the last year. We generated an operating profit of $214 million before noncash stock option expense, up 32% from the third quarter of last year and represented [Audio Gap] of Q3 revenue. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and investments, up $65 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $15 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets and $181 million used in the repurchase of our stock.  Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $91 million from stock proceeds and $19 million provided by working capital, we generated $190 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 155% of our reported GAAP net income in the third quarter. Turning to products. We received FDA approval for our suction irrigation instrument in the quarter, which, combined with the new thoracic grasper and new bipolar dissector, comprises an instrument kit designed to facilitate thoracic procedures. Early uptake of our thoracic instrument kit has been encouraging.  As we mentioned on our last call, we continued to answer questions posed by FDA on our Single-Site and vessel sealing products. Our interactions with FDA have been constructive and our teams are working diligently to answer their questions.  Our stapler continues to progress through its validation and testing processes and progress there remains encouraging. Given the current uncertainty of the U.S. regulatory process, we do not have additional information to share with you regarding timing for approval or launch of these products. With regard to recently launched products, our Firefly fluorescence imaging system is gaining acceptance with customers, primarily for visualizing vasculature in partial nephrectomy procedures. We are also pleased with the continued uptake of our da Vinci simulators and feedback on their use. Simulators and dual consoles are providing our customers with targeted tools to improve the quality and accessibility of robotic surgery training reflected in strong simulator purchases and steady demand for dual consoles.  Lastly, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. In the quarter, we moved our manufacturing operation to our new facility built to allow for increased capacity and proximity to our R&D center. We added 76 people to our team, predominantly in manufacturing, sales and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,845 employees. I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall L. Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our third quarter revenue was $447 million, up 30% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010, and up 5% compared with $426 million reported for the second quarter of 2011. Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows: Third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $176 million, up 38% compared with $128 million for the third quarter of 2010, and up 3% compared with $172 million in the second quarter of 2011. Year-over-year, instrument and accessory revenue growth was driven by procedure growth of 30% and early adopter purchases of recently launched products, including our Firefly and thoracic instrument sets. Quarter-over-quarter growth was primarily driven by procedure growth and sales of our recently launched products. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders of approximately $1,950 per procedure was higher than the $1,830 realized in the third quarter of 2010, and slightly higher than the $1,940 achieved in the second quarter of 2011. Over time, we expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base. This natural decline has been more than offset in recent quarters by the positive impact of our new instrument and accessory products. Third quarter 2011 systems revenue of $199 million increased 25% compared with $160 million of systems revenue through the third quarter of 2010, and increased 7% compared with $187 million of systems revenue for the second quarter of 2011. Our higher third quarter 2011 systems revenue was driven by higher system unit sales and higher system ASPs. We sold 133 systems in the third quarter of 2011 compared with 105 systems in the third quarter of the 2010 and 129 systems in the second quarter of 2011.  The third quarter of 2011 system count included 35 systems involving trade-ins of order units, comprised of 14 standard systems and 21 da Vinci Ss. During the second quarter of 2011, 36 systems involved trade-in comprised of 15 standard units and 21 da Vinci Ss. The third quarter 2010 system count included 15 standard system trade-ins, but excluded 10 S to Si upgrades that were treated as upgrade revenue since the S units were upgraded in the field. Upgrade revenue for the third quarter of 2011 was approximately $5 million compared with $10 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $1 million for the second quarter of 2011. Prior-year upgrade revenue included the 10 S to Si upgrade.  Our third quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades was $1.46 million, an increase from the $1.43 million realized in the third quarter of 2010 and an increase compared with the $1.44 million realized in the second quarter. The increase in average sales price reflects a higher proportion of dual console systems in the product mix as we sold 29 dual console systems in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 22 in the third quarter of 2010 and 21 in the second quarter 2011. Also benefiting the year-over-year comparison is revenue associated with our simulator product.  ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix. We sold 98 simulators in the third quarter of 2011, compared to 115 during the second quarter of 2011, which included 33 on backorder from the first quarter of 2011.  In total, we have sold 260 simulators in the first 9 months since its introduction. The large majority of simulators are purchased in conjunction with new da Vinci System sales and are included in our systems ASP calculation.  Service revenue increased to $72 million, up 25% compared with $57 million last year, and up 6% compared with $68 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger systems installed base. Total third quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $248 million, up 34% compared with the third quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with the second quarter of 2011. Recurring revenue represented 55% of total third quarter revenue compared with 54% in the third quarter last year and 56% last quarter.  International results were as follows: Procedures outside of the U.S. grew 34%, on a year-to-year basis, with dVP in Europe being the greatest driver, although we also experienced growth in our other target procedures, including dVH for malignant conditions in Europe. Third quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $94 million, up 59% compared with revenue of $59 million in the third quarter of 2010 and up 9% compared with revenue of $87 million in the second quarter of 2011. Instrument and accessory revenue outside the U.S. grew 51% year-over-year and decreased 7% sequentially driven by summer seasonality. We sold 34 systems outside of the U.S. compared with 22 in the third quarter of 2010 and 30 last quarter. We sold 18 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 16 in the third quarter of 2010 and 16 last quarter. Aleks will provide additional details of overseas system sales.  Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter was of 73% compared with 73% for the third quarter of 2010 and 72% for the second quarter of 2011. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2011 was driven by higher system ASPs and lower service parts consumption. Third quarter 2011 operating expenses of $147 million were up 24% compared with the third quarter of 2010 and up 6% compared with the second quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects cost associated with employees added during the quarter, higher engineering project costs and variable costs associated with increased revenue. We added 76 employees in the quarter, including 47 employees in product operations and 25 employees in commercial operations.  Third quarter 2011 operating income was $179 million or 40% of sales compared with $132 million or 38% of sales for the third quarter of 2010 and $168 million or 39% of sales for the second quarter of 2011.  Third quarter 2011 operating income reflected $35 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $30 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $35 million last quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 32% is consistent with the rate for the first 6 months of 2011 and lower than the 37% reflected in the previous year. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower foreign and state taxes.  Our net income was $122 million or $3.05 per share compared with $87 million or $2.14 per share for the third quarter of 2010 and $117 million or $2.91 per share for the second quarter of 2011.  Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 9 months of 2011. Procedures grew by 30%. Total revenue for the first 9 months of 2011 was $1.26 billion, up 23% compared with $1.02 billion last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 31% and an increase in systems revenue of 15%. Operating income for the first 9 months of 2011 was $495 million, up 23% compared with $402 million last year. Operating income included $102 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2011 compared with $88 million in 2010. Net income for the first 9 months of 2011 was $344 million or $8.55 per share compared with $261 million or $6.45 per share last year. Gross cash flows from operations for the first 9 months of 2011 totaled $527 million compared with $416 million last year. Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and investments of $1.89 billion, up $65 million compared with June 30, 2011. The increase was driven by $190 million of gross cash flows from operations plus $91 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $181 million of stock buyback and $15 million of capital and IP purchases. During the third quarter, we bought back 526,000 shares at an average price of $344 per share. As of September 30, there was $68 million of the Board-authorized buybacks remaining. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $265 million at September 30 from $250 million at June 30, primarily reflecting the higher or the impact of higher third quarter revenue. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter. Our net inventory increased to $109 million at September 30 from $100 million at June 30. Our higher inventory reflects our business growth, expanded product offering and safety stocks acquired for key components.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the third quarter, we sold 133 da Vinci Systems: 99 in the United States, 18 into Europe and 16 into rest of world markets. As part of the 133 system sales, 14 standard da Vinci Systems and 21 da Vinci S Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 98 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 2,031, the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide: 1,478 in the U.S., 357 in Europe and 196 in rest of world markets. 60 of the 133 systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 117 of the 133 systems sold represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 29 dual console systems. The 34 system sales internationally included 6 da Vinci Systems into Japan, 6 into Germany, 4 into India and 3 into Spain. Clinically, we had a strong quarter, achieving overall year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 30%. Colorectal and thoracic surgery growth was particularly strong, while gynecology displayed solid sequential growth, specifically, benign hysterectomy and myomectomy.  As mentioned in the past, Q3 represents certain seasonal challenges specifically in Europe. The months of July and August are particularly slow. Our European system sales growth for the quarter was less affected than our EU procedure business during these months. Our systems sales performance in Europe continues to be fueled by urology.  Q3 represents a quieter quarter for clinical trade shows and surgical conferences. However, it represented a very productive quarter for clinical publications within the medical journal. This quarter alone, nearly 400 papers and abstracts appeared within various peer-reviewed journals. Gynecology, urology, general and colorectal, head/neck, cardiac and thoracic surgery were well represented.  The British Journal of Urology, which is considered to be among the more conservative and most respected peer-reviewed urology journals in circulation, dedicated their entire September edition to papers reporting on da Vinci's role within their field. The edition contained 15 papers covering a wide range of da Vinci studies, including dVP, da Vinci Nephrectomy, da Vinci Cystectomy and da Vinci Pyeloplasty.  In addition to the market clinical reports in comparisons, there were also procedure technique and economic cost reviews. A few reports offered neutral or even clinical analysis of robotic surgery, but the majority were positive. Rather than taking time to review each of these papers in detail, I'll take a moment to highlight some of the written observations and conclusions.  With regard to da Vinci Cystectomy, Dr. Lee and his team from Cornell concluded that despite an increased materials cost, robotic radical cystectomy can be more cost-efficient than open radical cystectomy as a treatment for bladder cancer when the impact of complications is considered. With respect to da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy, Doctors Abreu and Gill from USC reported that within their study, 0 ischemia robotic partial nephrectomy was successful in all cases without any higher eclamping and the warm ischemia time was 0 in all cases. They also stated that the elimination of warm ischemia may ultimately preserve renal function. Doctors Cha and Lee wrote, "Robotic partial nephrectomy appears to be a viable minimally invasive option for nephron-sparing surgery. Robotic partial nephrectomy may reduce some of the technical challenges associated with lap partial nephrectomy, and thus, extend the potential benefits of minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery to a larger population." [Audio Gap], simply, that da Vinci has become an integral tool in urologic cancer surgery, and its presence in the global urologic community has become widespread. The dedication of an entire British Journal of Urology edition to robotic surgery is just further evidence of this phenomenon.  A very large observational study comprised of over 19,000 prostate cancer surgery patients appeared in the British Journal of Urology a month earlier. The study analyzed the substitution that took place between open prostatectomy and minimally invasive prostatectomy over a 4-year period beginning in 2003. These patients had their prostatectomy between 2003 and 2006. However, the reported trends should certainly apply to subsequent years. The study emanated out of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and was a collaboration between the Division of Urology and the Center for Surgery and Public Health. The aim of the study was to determine differences in surgical outcomes by surgical approach during a period of rapid adoption for the minimally invasive surgical approach to radical prostatectomy. The study noted that minimally invasive radical prostatectomy had grown from 5.7% of the U.S. prostatectomies in 2003 to approximately 39.2% in 2006. At the same time, open prostatectomy decreased by approximately 33.5%.  During this study period, the length of hospital stay for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy decreased from 2 days to 1 day, and the length of stay for [Audio Gap] 3.2 days to 2.9 days. The perioperative complication rate for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy had decreased from 13.8% to 10.7% while at the perioperative complication rate for open prostatectomy had decreased from 18.1% to 14.6%. Said another way, the perioperative complication rate for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy at the end of 2006 was 27% less than it was for open prostatectomy.  When comparing the data over the entire 4-year study period, the results were fairly striking. Perioperative complications were 27% less for the minimally invasive group. Blood transfusions were fewer by 83%. Anastomotic strictures were fewer by 51%, and length of stay was shorter by 42%. In their conclusions, the authors stated, and I quote, "The increased use of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy corresponds with a decreasing trend for complications, blood transfusions, length of stay and need for reoperation. Additionally, minimally invasive radical prostatectomy was found to have fewer associated complications compared with men undergoing the open procedure." As we've mentioned in previous calls, da Vinci's role within the specialty of thoracic surgery is on the rise. The desire to reduce or eliminate large, painful intercostal incisions is shared mutually by patients and surgeons. Traditional video-assisted thoracoscopy has provided some relief for patients. However, its adoption has been somewhat limited to smaller, less complex procedures.  While da Vinci Lobectomy, wedged and segmental procedures, are relatively new, with instrument sets that have yet to be optimized, it's early adoption has been strong. In a recent edition of the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Dr. Robert Cerfolio and his team from the University of Alabama, Birmingham published a study on their initial 168 consecutive completely portal robotic pulmonary resections. The study took place over a 14-month period and included lobectomies, wedge and segmental resections. The majority, 106 patients, had da Vinci Lobectomies. The results of the da Vinci patients were compared to 318 propensity-matched patients who underwent a rib and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. The metrics that made up the comparison were morbidity, mortality, quality of life, hospitalization and operative time. Dr. Cerfolio reported that the da Vinci group had a morbidity rate of 27% compared to a 38% morbidity rate for the thoracotomy group. Associated mortality was 0 for the da Vinci group and 3.1% for the thoracotomy group. Quality-of-life metrics were defined as the subject's functioning and well-being in the physical, psychological and social domains in relation to their disease and treatment. In this comparison, the da Vinci group scored 53 compared to 40 with the thoracotomy group. Hospitalization was reduced in half, 4 days to 2, when performing these procedures robotically. And finally, technical procedure improvements in their final 106 patients, which included fourth arm retraction and some minor instrument modification, only one was converted to an open thoracotomy. All patients underwent a lymph node dissection, which yielded an average of 17 lymph nodes. As is usually the case with initial series comparisons, the procedure time for the robotics patients was shown to be a bit longer than with the open thoracotomy group.  In conclusion, the author states, and I quote, "The newly refined 4-arm robotic lobectomy is safe and yields an R0 resection with complete lymph node removal. It has a lower morbidity, mortality, shorter hospital stay and better quality of life than rib and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. Technical advances are possible to shorten and improve the operation." As many of you have recently read, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has published its recommendations against PSA screening for prostate cancer. Their recommendation applies to U.S. men that do not have symptoms that are considered highly suspicious for prostate cancer, regardless of age, race or family history. You may also be aware that the American Urology Association disagrees with the panel's recommendation. Our position on this topic is consistent with the 18,000 physicians that comprise the AUA. It is our belief that the physician members of the AUA are in the best position to appropriately assess the tools and techniques for screening their patients for this serious disease. This concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the time over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing an update to our financial guidance for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures. Based upon our year-to-date procedure results, we are increasing our guidance for 2011. Our prior forecast was for total 2011 procedures to grow approximately 27% to 29% for the year. We now project procedures to grow approximately 29% to 30% from an estimated 278,000 procedures performed in 2010.  Moving onto revenues. We are also raising our 2011 total revenue guidance. On our last call, we had estimated 2011 revenue to grow approximately 19% to 21% above 2010 results. Based upon higher capital and recurring revenue projections, we are now forecasting total 2011 revenue to increase between 22% and 23% for the year.  We are also slightly increasing our guidance for 2011 gross margin percentage. Our previous guidance was for full year 2011 gross margin to come in at roughly 72% of revenue. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage now stands at 72.3%. We now forecast our full year 2011 gross profit percentage to be consistent with these year-to-date results within a range of between 72% and 72.5%. Moving to operating expense. We continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Driven primarily by higher variable expenses associated with our higher revenue forecast, we now anticipate full year 2011 operating expenses to grow between 19.5% and 20.5% above 2010 levels, compared to 18% to 20% growth previously forecast.  Our guidance for significant noncash expenses remains unchanged. We continue to expect 2011 noncash stock compensation to total between $135 million and $140 million and amortization of purchases of intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million. We are slightly reducing our guidance for other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income. We now expect 2011 other income to total around $15 million, down from the $17 million to $18 million previously forecast.  With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2011 income tax rate to fall within a range of between 32% and 33% of pretax income, consistent with the guidance provided on our previous call. We estimate that our diluted share count for calculated Q4 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.2 million shares. Going forward, we plan to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock to reduce the dilutive effects of stock option grants. Finally, regarding our cash flows. Since our guidance calls for over $150 million in noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our financial performance than net income.  And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mr. Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Gary, just a couple of questions for you. I guess, first, if you think about the investments that you've been making over the last couple of years, they appear to be paying off in the form of increased productivity and sort of strong sequential growth despite the challenges around seasonality. And I know you talked before about holding the operating margins down to about 40% for a variety of reasons, but primarily to drive long-term penetration, but also for obviously, other obvious reasons. If you think about where do you go from here coming out of the fourth -- the third quarter with a 40% operating margin and a lot of the opportunities you have, what are the kind of the key priorities over the next, maybe, 4 or 5 quarters for additional investments above and beyond what you might have been looking at before?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes. So I think the biggest investment that you've been talking about, at least in that question, I think, is around sales force in the commercial operation. And we've continued to do that, we're investing and we've moderated our investments in the U.S. sales force. Although in Europe and in Asia, we have been investing on the commercial side of the business, and we'll continue to do so. We think that those are good investments. And then this has been a period of substantial product development investment, and we are continuing to do that as well. So I think it's nothing big and surprising. I think it's a little bit of more of the same.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then 2 quick follow-ups, if I may. Can you update us on sort of a Japanese organization, what you have on the ground there? Where you're making investments today? And if there's any update on regulatory timing -- excuse me, reimbursement timing? And then, second, is it fair to say that da Vinci Hysterectomy is still north of 60% of your sequential procedure growth even in a seasonally weak quarter?
Gary S. Guthart: To the first question on Japan, the first sets of investments have really been kind of back office investments. So we're building an organization that's capable of handling regulatory and logistics kinds of functions and supporting our reimbursement efforts with the Japanese government. We're engaged. We think we're engaged with the right elements of MHLW in Japan. I don't have any additional color for you on timing of those efforts. So that continues. On the procedures side, I don't have the exact splits in front of me. I think I'll look to Aleks to cover that question.
Aleks Cukic: Ben, could you repeat the way you phrased that question? It was on -- it was with hysterectomy, I understand. You were talking about growth on a sequential basis, but I kind of lost it after that.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Sure. I mean, if you look at the growth both this quarter, I think, and then over the next couple of years, the key determinant for that sequential procedure growth is likely to be dVH, and we calculated it at about 60% or more. And I'm curious if that was what you saw in the quarter, if that's still sort of a reasonable assumption for the next couple of years?
Aleks Cukic: Well, not commenting on the percentage and certainly over the time frame of a couple of years, but I will say that the sequential hysterectomy, specifically in the benign side, was very strong in Q3.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: This is Jon Demchick in for David. We saw strong system placements this quarter in an environment where many had been a little concerned about capital equipment. Last quarter, you mentioned that there was an increase in customer's financing systems, and I was curious if that was still the case. Also if there where any macro changes in the environment that you could point out either in Europe or in the U.S.?
Calvin Darling: Yes, this is Calvin. I'll comment on the leasing side. You brought up last quarter, we saw a kind of a spike in the percentage of a systems finance up to around the 30% range. What we saw here in the third quarter was a return to the normal rate, I guess, that we've seen over the past few years, which is within the range between 15% and 20% of the systems going through financing. And just to remind everyone, we don't hold any of the paper for those loans. Those are all with third-party vendors. And I'll leave it to Marshall to comment on the environment.
Marshall L. Mohr: So I think you're out pointing specifically to Europe, and I say that we did have a successful capital sales quarter in Europe despite seasonality. But having said that -- and it's driven by dVP growth in the major countries of Germany, France and Italy. Going forward, it's hard to predict what will happen in those is specific economies. But again, I think we had a successful quarter.
Aleks Cukic: Yes. I would only add that if you looked at the second quarter, Germany wasn't particularly strong in Q2, but here you are in Q3 and 6 systems were placed. You had Spain, which, again, has been in the headlines for its own challenges during the past several quarters, which is also participated with 3 systems. So I think it's important to recognize that the underlying stimulus on systems getting placed is the strength of the procedures, and that continues to be the case.
Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got you, okay, very helpful. Another question I wanted to follow up on was prostatectomy procedures given the, I guess, increased focus with PIVOT and watchful waiting and then also the recommendation against PSA. I was wondering if you've seen physicians changing their behavior at all, and how you kind of expect these procedures to trend in 2012. And lastly, if you've heard any insurers talking about altering coverage at all?
Aleks Cukic: So a couple of things. One is with respect to -- you said a few things there, you said, PIVOT, watchful waiting, the recommendation against PSAs, just to separate all of those. So the latest news is from the panel preventive -- the preventive panel, but -- which is different from what you had described earlier. So in general, I think, our view on dVP, and it has been this way for some time, is that we consider it fairly flat in the United States, and it's been that way for a few quarters. And the majority of the growth in dVP should happen outside the United States. In the short period we've had following the panel recommendations and the discussions we've had with physicians, a lot of physicians believe that they will follow the guidelines of the AUA. Now how that unfolds over time is really anyone's guess at this point. And we're not going to speculate what that what might mean. But we believe that the men and women that comprise the AUA are, as I said earlier, in the best position to determine that care and that testing for their patients, and that's what we support. We will see what that leads to in time.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Collins Stewart.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division: Can you maybe pry the number of Firefly systems you sold in the quarter?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes. In Marshall's commentary, when we're talking about instrument and revenue -- instrument and accessory revenue per procedure, we've seen that at a level around , let's say, 1,940 to 1,950 level all-in, including stocking orders. That metric was helped in these last few quarters by the new products that we've launched in instruments and accessories, including the thoracic kits, some of new vision instruments, the 0.5 millimeter scope, and now this fluorescence imaging product, which is included in accessories. So the combination of those products has moved that overall metric. And we're encouraged with what we've seen on the fluorescence side in terms of our initial sites. But I don't think we're in the position to say exactly how many are sold, but we think it's positive movement on the new products.
Aleks Cukic: Yes. There's also a few components of that, which makes it a little difficult to sort of piece it out and give you a clean number. In other words, there's scopes, there's die, there's a few sources of revenues, if you will, SKUs that makeup that system.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division: Got you. Is it possible to maybe comment on how many Fireflies are out in the field, just in general being used, tested?
Aleks Cukic: I don't have that number. I don't know if Marshall has it.
Marshall L. Mohr: We're not ready to report, Tao.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division: And then just maybe on the gross margin side, the service part of that came in higher than expected and probably better than it's been for a while, actually forever. Is that -- how much of that is due to the Si potentially being less of a service-intensive system?
Marshall L. Mohr: I think you've seen that we've built into the systems better quality over time, and that has served to reduce the cost associated with service. I think though on the other hand, the service margins can be a little bumpy because it depends on service part consumption. And in this quarter, we had a lower service part consumption. I don't know that the 65% is necessarily sustainable over a period of time. I think that the rates that you saw over the last few quarters are probably more indicative.
Operator: And our next question comes the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just wondering if you could talk a bit about system mix. I know you don't provide data anymore by kind of hospital size, but to what extent are you seeing uptake by the community hospitals and then second and third tier hospitals? And then the repeat systems, are they largely being driven by hospitals wanting to get into new procedures or just pulling a higher volume of patients around dVP or dVH, that would be helpful?
Aleks Cukic: Yes. So this is a reminder. We had 60 of the 133 systems went to existing customers, which means that there were 73 customers that bought for the first time. Within both cohorts, both the existing customers, as well as the new first-time buyers, we've seen a, I'd say, a pretty good mix across various-sized hospitals from fairly, what you might consider smaller hospitals to large hospitals. So I think that continues. I don't know that there's anything remarkably different from one quarter to the next because it ultimately follows the path to the patient. In other words, if the procedures are being performed, procedures like GYN, benign hysterectomy, myomectomies, if they're being performed in smaller hospitals, then it stands to reason that the physicians that are looking to participate in those procedures are going to look toward da Vinci. So it can certainly move into smaller hospitals and it continues to do that. But I don't think there's any new trends to really report on there. As far as the overall number of hospitals that own more than one now, I believe following Q3, there are almost 300 hospitals that have, and in fact, 299 hospitals that own more than one system. You have 5 hospitals that own 6 systems, you have 3 hospitals that own 5, you've got 15 that own 4 and you've got 45 that own 3 and 231 that own 2. So I don't know. Again, that's been fairly consistent. We keep adding to the -- each of those cohorts. So I guess, I'll give the -- summarize this long answer, there really isn't anything remarkable that I think we can point to over the past few quarters in terms of demographics.
Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then going back to the question on dVP. We understand the shortcoming to the task force. I mean the other side of it has been -- there was a JAMA article and the New York Times article, questioning kind of the outcomes. I understand the JAMA article was kind of old data. But to what extent do you see any impact from either of those publications?
Aleks Cukic: Like I said earlier, it's very difficult to say. As long as I've been aware and been in this business, there has been very little consensus around this very topic on PSA screening, watchful waiting. It is constantly being evaluated. It's constantly being studied by different groups. I don't think there's anything that we believe has come out that's been conclusive in terms of the negative here. And I think it's going to be something personally that's going to be debated for some time to come. And -- but I'll be careful not to project expectations based on any of this because it's really anyone's guess at this point.
Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then on single port, can you just talked a little bit about use in Europe? I mean, you talked last quarter I think about general surgery, seeing some signs of adoption, and I think you've got 10 sites or so using SILS over there. And also as we think about getting data back to the FDA here, can you use data from those European sites?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes, so the answer on the first side, most of our Single-Site experience in Europe remains focused on closed cystectomy. As you know, Q3 is a slow quarter for European procedures as a whole. But we're seeing continued use and uptake of the Single-Site product there. We have collected data from Europe and other sources. And we have provided that to FDA and are continuing to answer any questions that they have on that data, so we have supplied that.
Operator: And our next question comes from line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.
David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on some of the new procedures. Gary, in some of your remarks, you did touch briefly on some of the specific procedures where you were seeing some uptake outside of dVH and dVP. But could you give us maybe some sense to what percentage of the U.S. mix those procedures represent this quarter and maybe how that compares to the last year and the prior quarter sequentially?
Gary S. Guthart: Yes. I don't have the specific breakouts for you. But if you look at what we think of as follow-on procedures in the U.S., so in urology, it's really going from prostate cancer to kidney cancer. So partial nephrectomies, that's been growing nicely for us in the U.S, and then behind that, bladder cancer and cystectomies. Partial nephrectomies are becoming a material part of the business. Cystectomy is a little bit smaller disease state, but continues to rise. On the GYN side, the follow-on procedures then are myomectomy. That has been growing nicely for us. Sacrocolpopexies, pelvic floor reconstruction and endometriosis resection, and those have also started to grow. So taken those categories, the follow-ons have been growing nicely. And then in the case of urology, you're growing faster, of course, than dVP in the U.S.
Aleks Cukic: I'll just add to that. Outside of the categories of GYN and urology, we've talked a little bit about thoracic surgery, we've talked a little bit about colon surgery, and I would say that within, specifically, within colon and rectal surgery, earlier, our focus had really been on the low rectal cancers, the low anterior resections and the AP resections. And we've talked about this in the past where, if successful in these very difficult anatomies, low in the rectum, that the likelihood of surgeons looking at it in the right colon, the left colon, the sigmoid colon, the likelihood of them starting to really evaluate da Vinci's role in there is probably pretty high. And I would say on a sequential basis, if you looked at some of the growth in those areas, it was very strong. The same I think could be said about thoracic surgery. When you look at the lobectomies, wedge and segmental resections, and recognize that neither of these areas is fully optimized yet with the instrument set. But there's a very good core of instruments that'll [Audio Gap] procedure, which they are doing. So I would just say quantitatively, those areas, and through a seasonally challenged quarter like Q3, we're showing very, very promising growth.
David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up on Japan, you talked -- I think you said you placed 6 systems in the quarter -- sold 6 systems in the quarter in Japan. Can you just kind of update us on what the sort of installed base looks like in Japan right now? And how we can sort of think about the addressable market, both with and without reimbursement?
Aleks Cukic: Well, the installed base specifically, I can give you...
Marshall L. Mohr: We stand at 35 ending in this quarter.
Aleks Cukic: Yes. And I think that the challenge on trying to project what the market looks like in advance of knowing what the reimbursement climate looks like is kind of a dangerous exercise. In other words, we know it is not optimized for mass market distribution. We also know that hospitals that are purchasing it now are purchasing it with the full understanding that they're going to have to go through a manual process to get reimbursement. Some of them have been very successful in getting that reimbursement initially for dVP. So you are still sort of handcuffed in terms of trying to address the broader markets. And until you get the reimbursement and understand what you're being reimbursed for, it's difficult for us to say. But we're encouraged by the fact that there are 35 systems that are in Japan already and the sort of demand that the -- that has built in Japan for robotic surgery, we believe, is strong.
David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Maybe last in the P&L. The 40% operating margin that -- at least, over the past couple of years, that's pretty much a high water market. And maybe close to sort of not a peak point for you. It's really the highest we've seen in some time. Can you maybe sort of talk about sort of investment priorities on a go-forward basis? It sounds as though there a lot of the investments in the U.S., there was big step up in sales force, I think, in the end of last year on the hysterectomy side. And that seems to be paying some rewards. But as you look at some of the other markets outside of the United States, obviously, the sales base is somewhat small relative to total. How can we sort of think about a trajectory with respect to investment spending because you're still generating quite a bit of operating leverage even at margins at this level?
Marshall L. Mohr: Yes. So our goal is not to drive operating returns higher than that profile. Investment-wise, as we said earlier, we're really looking at it and the commercial organization keeping pace in the U.S., investing in Japan and Europe and other countries. On the product side, we continue to invest in the products we tell you about and acquiring and developing technologies, we think, are going to have an impact in the long run. But we really believe we're in the early phases of adoption of robotic surgery. And as a result, we're willing to make those investments, both from the commercial organization and in the product development side.
Operator: And we -- our next question comes from Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: If we could talk a little bit more about some of the general surgery, I mean, Aleks, I think you said colorectal is doing well. Can you give us any more color on the growth there or the growth relative to the rest of the business? And just related to that, are -- to where it is, I know we're not going to hear precisely, but are the new instrument approvals required to see that next steep acceleration of the growth curve here?
Aleks Cukic: Well, you said it correctly. We're not going to break out the numbers in detail for you. But I think you've heard us over the years, and certainly you have been following us for as long as you've had. In that, we look at early adopters and recognize that early adopters will put up with what we term as fiddle factors, something that is less than optimized. And we saw it with prostatectomy. We saw it with hysterectomy. We've seen with just about everything we've done. And when we look at general surgery, specifically colon and rectal surgery, there is a very good set of instrumentation. There's ways to manage the vessels either by suturing, by using our PK device or our harmonic device and/or stapling through an ancillary port. It's just not optimized in the sense that the surgeon has to break the choreography, have someone else do tasks that they would like to do or should do or believe is in their best interest to do or break scrub and so on and so forth. Now despite all of that, we're seeing very nice trajectories in the growth in both in low anterior resection, in sigmoid resection, in right colon resections, in thoracic surgery. But as you said, we're not going to break those out in detail. I would say that it is very encouraging at an early stage, but it's difficult to tell you much more without really going into the details or the numbers. Is it necessary to have those other instruments? We believe to get the full optimization, you have to optimize the procedure, you have to optimize the instrument set. You'll grow until you get there, but hopefully, if you spec the instruments right, it should be a nice addition to the armamentarium.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Got you. And to follow up on that, Gary, I know that -- or Marshall, I know that the FDA is particularly opaque now, and there's not much to be gained by making public forecast. But, I mean, should we assume that there's -- that the chances are low, that these new products are approved this year? Does it feel, now just given the pace of things and just the pace of what's going on with everybody at the FDA, that it's more likely to fall into 2012?
Marshall L. Mohr: I can handicap it for you. I guess I'll tell you that we're engaged in constructive discussion. I think that the questions and answers are pretty reasonable and we're working through them. How long that will go on for, I cannot predict.
Aleks Cukic: Yes. I think it's also -- just to the level-set, Rick, and if you replay the tape over the last few quarters, you'd see that we are further along in the Single-Site submission than we are in the vessel sealing and that we are in the stapling. Stapling, we haven't submitted yet. So recognizing that the calendar gets converted to 2012 relatively soon, you should be able to perhaps answer your own question there.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Okay. And just last, if I could. The European outlook is incredibly confusing on multiple fronts. Are you more concerned now about the next few quarters in Europe, given the political and economic disruption than you have been in the past? Or I mean, just again, I'd be curious to just get your sense of just the general environment. Obviously, you did a great job this quarter.
Gary S. Guthart: Yes. For us, we don't -- there's uncertainty for us as well. We don't have a crystal ball into what the economic winds will bring there. We do feel that the interest in the procedure adoption has been high, particularly in the countries that have most of the population and are really adopting nicely now. And so we think if that's true, ultimately, system sales should follow. It may be lumpy depending on local market conditions, and so we'll see. We had a good quarter this quarter, and we'll see where it carries us next. We have time for just one more question.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Lennox Ketner with Bank of America.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a few quick ones. First on your guidance for procedure growth has gone from, I think, about 25% to 28% initially to 29% to 30% when a lot of companies are talking about seeing pressure on procedure volumes. I'm just wondering if it's possible to characterize where that upside has come from in that? Is it relative to your initial thoughts? Is it coming -- is the upside coming from 1 or 2 specific procedures?
Aleks Cukic: I don't know that it is one procedure. I think if you look at it in terms of the GYN, GYN is a large bucket and really drives a lot of that growth. In 2009 on the year-over-year basis, GYN has been very strong, and not just hysterectomy, but myomectomy and sacrocolpopexy, endometrial resections. I would say some of the general surgery procedures, i.e., the colon and rectal procedures, even into the thoracic procedures, although they're not as large as some of the other categories we talked about at this stage, growth from a number of procedures adds up pretty well. And the pull through procedures on urology, as well as some of the OUS [ph] dVP business has been strong. So it's really come from a number of places, and I think pretty good performance on our downstream commercial team.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, so more across the board. And then on the Cooley [ph] Single-Site product in Europe, you mentioned you're still seeing good uptick there. But I think last quarter, you said you were at 10 sites. Are you guys -- are you able to give us the number of sites that you're at now? Is it so close to center? Have you rolled that out more broadly?
Gary S. Guthart: We're adding sites, but we're adding them slowly. So I don't have the specific number of sites in front of me right now. But in general, really the first part of our experience in Europe has been to optimize the products and to get feedback on how customers are using it. And we're working on getting its approval in the U.S. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focused on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients.  Lori of Pennsylvania shares the following experience, "I had been suffering with painful periods for almost 2 years. I had already had one endoscopic surgery, and I got very little relief from the pain. After suffering for several more months and having to spend 2 to 3 days in bed each month and everyone telling me I needed to have a hysterectomy, I decided I needed to try something else. A friend and co-worker recommended Dr. Coslett to me. I met with him and started to feel that maybe there was hope for me that didn't require hysterectomy. Dr. Coslett explained the procedure that he would perform and the risks. He said there would be only an 8% chance of the endometriosis recurring. He explained that he would be performing the procedure with the help of a robotic arm. I agreed to the procedure and I am thrilled that I did. That procedure took 1.5 hours. Dr. Coslett removed all of the endometriosis and an endometrioma. I have had 2 periods since the surgery, and I'm amazed at the results. I'm leading a normal life again. I do still have the normal cramping that accompanies most women's periods, but I no longer need to spend several days in bed and take prescription pain relievers. There was very little scarring because the procedure only required 4 small incisions. And the pain I experienced was less than I would do -- than I would experience when I get my period. My only regret is that I didn't find Dr. Coslett sooner. When I compared this procedure to my other endoscopic procedure, the da Vinci procedure was far better. There was less scarring, and I experienced less pain with the da Vinci procedure. I only took 2 pain pills after the procedure and went back to my normal routine in less than a week. I would definitely recommend the da Vinci." Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committing to driving the vital few things that really make a difference.  This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.

In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights. Then I'll provide you with an update to our financial forecast for 2011. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our growth in da Vinci procedures and with customer response to our recently released products in the second quarter. Our team has executed well in our 4 areas of focus for 2011, which are first, extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and urology globally. Second, expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia. Third, crisp execution in our product development efforts. And finally, enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral, colorectal and general surgery.  Turning to procedures. Total procedures grew 30% over Q2 of 2010. And da Vinci Hysterectomy followed its seasonal pattern posting solid growth in hysterectomy for both malignant and benign conditions.  In urology, da Vinci prostatectomy continued to grow, primarily through growth in Europe as expected. Pull-through procedures namely partial nephrectomy, endometrial resection and sacrocolpopexy grew nicely in the quarter. Emerging procedures in TransOral Robotic Surgery, thoracic surgery and colorectal surgery have also showed strength, with clinical publications emerging from early adopting centers. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.  Turning to operating highlights for the second quarter. Procedures grew approximately 30% over the second quarter of 2010. We sold 129 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 108 during the second quarter of last year, and 99 of which were purchased by U.S. customers.  Total revenue was $426 million, up 21% over last year. Instrument and Accessory revenue increased to $172 million, up 35% over Q2 of 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $239 million, up 31% from prior year and comprising 56% of total revenue. Net income was $117 million, up 32% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $203 million before noncash stock option expense, up 19% from the second quarter of last year and representing 48% of Q2 revenue. We ended the quarter with $1,822,000,000 in cash and investments, up $65 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $39 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets, and $139 million used in the repurchasing of stock. Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $32 million from stock proceeds and $41 million provided by working capital, we generated $170 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 145% of our reported GAAP net income for the second quarter. Turning to products, we launched 3 new instruments in the U.S. this quarter. A Thoracic Grasper and Medium-Large Clip Appliers and a Bipolar Dissector. We also received the CE mark for our fourth product, our section irrigation [ph] instrument and we have begun its rollout in Europe.  We have submitted our 510(k) for the section irrigation [ph] instrument and are working through the approval process with FDA. New instruments allow for faster and more precise da Vinci procedures and these new additions to our instrument line are targeted at facilitating our emerging procedures in thoracic and general surgery.  As we mentioned last quarter, the FDA has requested additional clinical data for our Single-Site product. We have collected this clinical data from both the U.S. and European sites, and we'll resubmit our Single-Site 510(k) to FDA this month. Clinical results from Single-Site use in Europe are encouraging and our phase roll out in Europe is progressing. With Single-Site running at approximately 10 sites.  We continue to make good progress on both our da Vinci vessels healing instrument and our da Vinci stapler. We are in the process of answering FDA questions on our vessels healing instrument, while progressing through its manufacturing bring up. Our stapler is developing on plan, and we are working through its validation.  Moving to recently released products. Our da Vinci Simulator has been well received by our customers. After dual console, the simulator is the second step in a set of products aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of da Vinci training.  The simulator has fit well with both dual console and single console Si customers and it is providing surgeons with improved, ease of access and support in learning da Vinci surgery.  Several studies evaluating phase, content and construct validity of the simulator are in process and the initial response from surgeons, trainers in our field has been enthusiastic. Our phase rollout of Florescence Imaging is progressing to plan with its initial use building in partial nephrectomy procedures. Lastly, we're investing in building our team, in expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter, we added 40 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D. Bringing our total team to 1,769 employees. I'll now pass this time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our second quarter revenue was $426 million, up 21% compared with $351 million to the second quarter of 2010, and up 10% compared with $388 million reported for the first quarter of 2011.  Second quarter revenues per product category were as follows. Second quarter Instrument and Accessory revenue was $172 million, up 35% compared with $128 million to the second quarter of 2010, and up 9% compared with $157 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increases in Instruments and Accessories are primarily driven by procedure growth. Instrument and Accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is higher than the $1,870 realized in the second quarter of 2010, and approximately the same at the first quarter of 2011. Relative to the second quarter of 2010, the increase primarily reflects increased stocking orders associated with increased system sales. We expect Instruments and Accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base.  Second quarter 2011 Systems revenue of $187 million increased 11%, compared with $168 million of Systems revenue for the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 12% compared with $167 million of Systems revenue for the first quarter of 2011. We sold 129 systems in the second quarter of 2011, compared with 108 systems in the second quarter of 2010 and 120 systems in the first quarter of 2011. The second quarter 2011 system count included 36 trade-ins, of which 21 were S for Si trade-off. In the first quarter of 2011 included 32 trade-ins, of which 19 were S for Si trade off. The second quarter 2010 system count included 19 trade-ins but excluded 10 S Si upgrades that were treated as upgrade revenue since the S units were upgraded in the field. Upgrade revenue for the second quarter of 2011 was approximately $800,000, compared with $7.6 million to the second quarter of 2010 and $1.5 million to the first quarter of 2011. Prior year upgrade revenue included the 10 S Si upgrade.  Our second quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and S to Si trade-ins but excluding upgrades, was $1.44 million, a decrease from the $1.48 million realized in the second quarter of 2010, and an increase compared with the $1.38 million realized in the first quarter. The increase in average sales price compared with the first quarter of 2011 reflects the increased simulator set revenue and a favorable mix of systems to customers.  We recognized revenue for 115 simulators in the quarter, including 33 that were sold in the first quarter in conjunction with system sales but were not delivered until the second quarter. In total, we have sold 162 simulators in the first 6 months. Included in the mix of systems sold in the second quarter were 21 dual console systems, compared with 15 in the first quarter.  The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior year reflects a favorable product and geographic mix in the first -- in the second quarter of 2010. Credits associated with the S trade-ins in the current quarter partially offset by simulator revenues. ASPs will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product, customer and trade-in mix.  Service revenue increased to $68 million, up 22% compared with $55 million last year. And up 6 million -- up 6% compared with $64 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total second quarter recurring revenue comprised of Instrument, Accessory and Service revenue increased to $239 million, up 31% compared with the second quarter of 2010 and up 8% compared with the first quarter of 2011. Recurring revenue represented 56% of total second quarter revenue, compared with 52% in the second quarter last year and 57% last quarter.  International results were as follows, procedures outside of the U.S. grew 38% on a year-to-year basis with dVP in Europe being the greatest driver. Although we also experience growth in other target procedures, including dVH for malignant conditions in Europe, second quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $87 million, up 38% compared with revenue of $63 million in the second quarter of 2010, and down 5% compared with revenue of $91 million in the first quarter of 2011. Instrument and Accessory revenue grew 57% year-over-year and decreased 1% sequentially. The changes in Instrument and Accessory revenue reflect growth in procedures and seasonal buying patterns of our customers.  We sold 30 systems outside the U.S, compared with 22 in the second quarter of 2010, and 31 last quarter. We sold 16 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 14 in the second quarter of 2010 and 15 last quarter. Aleks will provide additional details of our overseas system sales.  Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the second quarter was 72%, compared with the second quarter of 2010 gross margin of 73% and compared with the first quarter, 2011 gross margin of 72%. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2010 primarily reflects decreased system ASPs. Second quarter 2011 operating expenses at $139 million were up 18%, compared with the second quarter of 2010 and up 6% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter and costs associated with increased revenue. We added 40 employees during the quarter, including 23 employees in our commercial operations organization and 17 employees in product operation. Second quarter 2011 operating income was $168 million or 39% of sales, compared to -- with $140 million or 40% of sales for the second quarter of 2010, and $148 million or 38% of sales for the first quarter of 2011. Second quarter 2011 operating income reflected $35 million of noncash stock compensation expense, compared with $30 million to the second quarter of 2010 and $32 million last quarter. The increases in noncash compensation reflect our annual grant made February 15 of each year. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 32% is consistent with the rate for the first quarter and lower than the 33% recorded for the fiscal year ended 2010. Our net income was $117 million or $2.91 per share, compared with $89 million or $2.19 per share for the second quarter of 2010 and $104 million or $2.59 per share for the first quarter of 2011. Let me quickly summarize our results for the first 6 months of 2011. Procedures grew by 30%. Total revenue for the first 6 months of 2011 was $814 million, up 20% compared with $679 million last year. The revenue increase included recurring revenue growth of 29% and an increase in systems revenue of 9%. Operating income for the first 6 months of 2011 was $316 million, up 17% compared with $269 million last year. Operating income included $67 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first 6 months of 2011, compared with $57 million in 2010. Net income for the first 6 months of 2011 was $222 million or $5.51 per share, compared with $174 million or $4.31 per share last year. Cash flows from operations for the first 6 months of 2011 was $296 million compared with $291 million last year.  Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and investments of $1,822,000,000, up $65 million compared with March 31, 2011. The increase was driven by $196 million of cash flows from operations plus $32 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $139 million of stock buyback and $39 million of capital and IP purchases. During the second quarter, we bought back 401,000 shares at an average price of $347 per share. As of June 30, there was 249 million of the board authorized buybacks remaining. We also executed on the opportunity to purchase approximately 18 acres of land and buildings for $33 million next to our current Sunnyvale campus for possible long-term growth. Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $250 million at June 30, from $260 million at March 31 reflecting the timing of revenues and collection. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter. Our net inventory increased to $100 million at June 30, from $93 million at March 31. The increase reflects steps taken to increase component inventory where supplies are tightened and have build the finished goods to reduce the risk of supply disruption as we move our manufacturing operations to our new building at Sunnyvale. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the second quarter, we sold 129 da Vinci systems, 99 in the United States, 16 in Europe and 14 in the rest of world markets. As part of the 129 system sales, 15 standard da Vinci systems and 21 da Vinci S systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 93 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,933 the cumulative number da Vinci systems worldwide. 1,411 in the United States, 342 in Europe and 180 in the rest of world markets. 62 of the 129 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 121 of the 129 systems sold during the quarter represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 21 dual console systems. The 30 system sales internationally included 4 da Vinci systems into Japan, 4 into Italy and 3 into both Switzerland and India. Clinically, we had a strong quarter, achieving overall year-over-year growth of approximately 30%. Gynecology in the United States was particularly strong, while growth within general surgery, urology, thoracic and head-neck procedures was solid. As mentioned in the past, Q1 is a seasonally challenged quarter for surgeries that could be classified as discretionary, which causes some early lumpiness within benign gynecologic procedures. Consistent with Q2 2010 procedure trends, benign dVH growth during the second quarter of 2011 grew solidly faster than malignant dVH.  In addition to strong dVH adoption, sacrocolpopexy, endometrial resection, myomectomy have been key factors to the U.S. GYN expansion. In Europe, dVH growth has begun to emerge within malignant procedures, primarily endometrial and cervical cancer resection. In addition, the category of general surgery has shown signs of early adoption. However, most of our EU growth is still being fueled by urology.  In Asia, urology and general surgery were the strongest categories through the first half of the year. All in all, Q2 procedure growth showed global strength across several key categories.  Q2 represents our busiest quarter for clinical trade shows and surgical conferences. The volume of clinical data presented, procedure technique reviews and live surgery presentations was impressive. AUA represented 200 or so abstracts and 16 postgraduate courses. WRS was packed with live surgery, robotic panels and podium discussions covering all segments of surgery. Not to mention SAGES, the American Society of Colorectal Surgery, AATS and ACOG, as well as the various international conferences we participated in. We are convinced that the dissemination of peer-reviewed clinical data has been a critical factor in the rapid adoption of da Vinci surgery. And the peer-review exposure we received at these important venues is immeasurable. During the quarter, over 200 clinical papers were published within various peer-review journals representing all of our targeted specialties, but I'll take a moment to highlight just a few, which I believe represent an important theme. The economic impact of reduced complications and hospitalization and their connection toward improving clinical outcomes. In years past, providers would report on the cost effectiveness of robotic surgery in a fairly simple and consistent manner, whereby they consider the purchase price of the capital equipment add to it their operating costs and divide it by the number procedures they've completed. Direct cost comparisons were usually made to open a laparoscopic surgery. However, the cost of hospitalization and the cost of complications were often omitted.  Recent published studies have included broader analysis that includes both direct and indirect hospital costs. In a recent edition of the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a team from Brigham Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, comprised of both physician and business professionals, studied and reported on the evolution of the hospitals hysterectomy business in 2006 and compared it to 2009. Specifically, they study how the shift from open and vaginal hysterectomy to laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy had affected their costs. The paper entitled Increasing Minimally Invasive Hysterectomy, the effects on cost and complications evaluated the overall costs associated with 2,133 hysterectomy patients that underwent the procedure in 2006 and 2009.  This study reported and I quote, "A change from majority abdominal hysterectomy to minimally invasive hysterectomy was accompanied by a significant decrease in procedure related complications without an increase in total mean cost." Some of the relevant details. In 2006, approximately 65% of the 1,054 hysterectomies performed at Brigham and Women's were performed abdominally. In 2009, only 35% out of 1,079 were performed abdominally. Lap and robotic approaches comprised 17% of the hysterectomies in 2006, which grew to 46% in 2009. Vaginal hysterectomy remain fairly stable during this period and was typically confined to less complex cases. When evaluating outcomes and costs, the results were quite striking. The deviates cohort was associated with the lowest intraoperative and postoperative complication rates and the lowest estimated blood loss across all cohorts and along with laparoscopy, registered the lowest length of stay data in the group. The differences were considered very significant. When comparing abdominal hysterectomy to dVH, length of stay was reduced from 3.5 days to 1.4 days, estimated blood loss went from 363 millimeters to 75 milliliters. The most telling was the reported complication rate. The rate of major intraoperative and postoperative complications associated with abdominal hysterectomy was shown to be approximately 5x greater than with dVH.  To quote the authors, "Our data suggest that dedication to the implementation of a minimally invasive technique goals, such as a decreased complications, decreased operative times, decreased conversion rate and decreased estimated blood loss can be realized. A creation of a minimally invasive gynecology service at Brigham and Women's Hospital has benefited not only the trainees and the hospital but first and foremost our patients." In the June edition of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, a study out of Seattle authored by Doctors Paley, Veljovich and Shah entitled Surgical outcomes in gynecologic oncology in the era of surgical robotics: an analysis of the first 1,000 cases was published. This study was very comprehensive and it reported on multiple factors and clinical outcomes related to da Vinci cancer surgery. There were, however, 2 comparisons that were central in this paper. First, could the authors increase the complexity of their da Vinci patients without increasing the complication rates? And second, how did their dVH outcomes for endometrial cancer resection compare to open hysterectomy outcomes? The second objective would consist of a subset analysis of their most recent 377 da Vinci Hysterectomies and Endometrial Resection compared to the most recent endometrial resection, open endometrial resection surgeries. From 2006 to 2009, deviate share at the institution had grown from 9% to 36% of the GYN cancer resections. But further penetration was being governed by their unwillingness to accept higher BMI patients at the risk of increasing their complication rates, a concern, which was dispelled by their careful analysis. During the study period, the physicians raised their BMI constraints at 3 intervals, beginning at 26 until reaching at an average BMI of just over 30. Within their first interval, they operated on patient -- excuse me, within their final interval, they operated on patients with BMIs as high as 70. Interestingly, they discovered that neither their conversion rate nor complication rates increased within these more complex cohorts. In fact, they actually decreased. Their overall conversion rate for their entire 1,000 patient analysis was a mere 2.9% and their overall complication rate was 9.9%. 5.7% for majors and 4.2% for minor complications.  In a subset analysis of women undergoing endometrial cancer resection, the difference between dVH and open hysterectomy was significant. Major complications associated with open surgery was 20.6%, as compared to 6.4% for dVH. In patients with BMI in excess of 40, major complications dropped from 43.5% for open to 11.3% for dVH. Length of hospitalization was reduced from 5.3 days for open to 1.4 days with dVH. Lymphnode yields were approximately 10% higher within the dVH group. Intensive care unit admissions went from 3.8% for open to 0.5% for dVH.  Mortality rates dropped from 1.5% to 0.27%. Their conclusion, and I quote: "Robotic surgery is associated with favorable morbidity and conversion rates in an unselected cohort. Compared to laparotomy, robotic endometrial cancer surgery results in improved outcomes." In a recent edition of the British Journal of Urology, a physician group out of Cornell and Presbyterian Hospital, New York City published their study comparing the overall cost associated with open cystectomy, lymph node dissection and diversions to da Vinci Cystectomy with diversions. This prospective study consisted of 186 consecutive patients and included appropriate sensitivity analysis. The authors collected a myriad of cost data, both direct and indirect and these costs were carefully analyzed. Cost data included, but was not limited to, system and service amortization, disposables, length of stay, complications, surgeon fees and anesthesia cost. In other words, both direct and variable costs were collected and scrutinized. Their study contained 3 approaches to urinary diversion following cystectomy. With the ileal conduit approach being the most commonly performed and the largest subcategory study. Not surprisingly, the authors concluded that the greatest contribution to cost variation between the various cohorts were length of stay and complications. Across the board, the direct cost between the various cohorts was pretty similar plus/minus $1,000 or so. But the difference in variable cost was very significant, in da Vinci's favor. In an overall cost basis, comparing open cystectomy with ileal conduit to a da Vinci cystectomy with ileal conduit, it was reported that the da Vinci Cystectomy saved nearly $5,000 over the open surgical approach. The cost difference between the other 2 diversion techniques was less pronounced, slightly in da Vinci's favor for the continent, cutaneous diversion and slightly in the favor of the open technique for the orthotopic neobladder approach. The least common approach. The authors' conclusion, "Despite the higher cost of materials, robotic cystectomy can be more cost-efficient than open cystectomy for bladder cancers at high-volume tertiary referral center, particularly for ileal conduit." The reduction in hospitalization, blood loss, complications and overall hospital cost has been a consistent theme throughout Intuitive's short history. They are central components in our pursuit to improve patient value. That concludes my remarks. And I'll now turn the panel to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenue and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows.  Starting with procedures. Based upon our year-to-date procedure results, we are increasing our forecast for 2011. Our prior estimate for total 2011 procedures was to grow approximately 25% to 28% for the year. We now project procedures to grow approximately 27% to 29% from an estimated 278,000 procedures performed in 2010.  During the second half of this year, we would expect a similar seasonal pattern as we experienced last year in 2010, with Q3 being seasonally weaker and Q4 seasonally stronger.  Moving onto revenues. We are also raising our 2011 total revenue forecast. Previously, we had estimated 2011 revenue to grow 16% to 20% above 2010. We are now forecasting total 2011 revenue to increase 19% to 21% for the year. Again, the timing for the remaining quarters should follow last year's seasonal pattern favoring Q4. Remember that in Q3 of 2010, our sequential Instrument and Accessory revenue was roughly flat compared to Q2. And Q3 total revenue was lower than Q2. Our current forecast for gross margin percentage remains consistent with our last quarter's forecast. We continue to see 2011 gross margins coming in at around 72%.  Moving to operating expense. We continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Driven by our higher 2011 revenue forecast, we now anticipate operating expenses to grow at the higher end of the 16% to 20% range forecast on our last call. More precisely, we expect operating expenses to grow between 18% and 20%, above the 2010 level. In terms of noncash expenses, we now expect 2011 noncash stock compensation to total between $135 million and $140 million, $5 million less than forecast on our previous calls, up from $118 million reported in 2010. We continue to expect total 2011 amortization of purchases of intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income is expected to come in at between $17 million and $18 million, consistent with our previous estimate. With regard to income tax, we now expect our 2011 income tax rate to fall within the range between 32% and 33% of pretax income, compared to our previous forecast of approximately 33%. We estimate that our diluted share count for calculating Q3 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.2 million shares. We aim to keep this share count reasonably close to this level as we expect to offset the impact of option dilution via stock repurchases.  Finally, regarding cash flows. Since we're forecasting to report over $150 million in noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our financial performance than net income. And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Maybe starting off with a question on some of the new products on Flash and Imaging, can you just talk about how you see that product rolling out. I think you've talked about initial use in partial nephrectomy, just talk about your kind of go-to-market strategy for other areas for the imaging?
Gary Guthart: Sure. You know what, I think it's going to be a kind of slow go for us. The initial indication is for imaging of vasculature and so partial nephrectomy is the first place that we're looking. There are some folks out looking in other areas for applicability. Things like imaging in the colorectal domain. And so we'll see as that develops. We also have some work looking in better [ph] imaging, which is not yet on label. That's something that we'll have to follow up. So I think it's kind of a base capability. I think over time, we'll find extended uses for it. The early results and the anecdotes and partial nephrectomy look really promising.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then I guess, just dialing on some of the core procedures, dVP in the U.S., could you just talk about any kind of change in physician behavior? Kind of post the pivot data and whether you're encountering any interesting or different dynamics around watchful waiting?
Aleks Cukic: There doesn't appear to be anything at this stage that we can point to and say, it feels or looks different. As we've talk about the last few quarters, there may be some quarters where the U.S. dVP business is higher on a sequential business -- on a sequential basis, and there may be some quarters where its flat or somewhere that declines a bit. We're well within that range, and I can't say that there's anything significant that we've noticed at this point.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And then on colorectal, can you just talk about maybe your market development efforts and some of the traction you've had out of SAGES and WRS. And in the absence of having the stapler on the market, how much do you think you can really capture within the market?
Aleks Cukic: It's interesting. I think what we have learned over the years is that in procedure adoption, if it really follows a classic adoption curve in a sense that you'll have early adopters that will put up with some fill factors, we call it, and then you'll have people that will wait until the procedure gets optimized before they jump in, and there is a lot of evolution that goes on in that. I would say through that, it's pretty clear we're in the early adopters phase, and we're growing very nicely through the early adopters phase despite not having perfect optimization of Instruments and Accessories. How far we'll grow in that area? It's difficult to say, but we believe strongly that we're working on the right products. They are developing nicely. And the procedure is growing well through the early adoption phase, both in the low rectal, as we talked about in the low anterior resections and you're starting to see some gravitation up into sigmoid in some of the other areas. So we're pleased at this point.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then just last one, can you talk about sizing the market opportunity for the simulator? It's obviously relatively new from our perspective, how big do you think that opportunity could be?
Aleks Cukic: I think if you look at simulation, and I think we talked about this as early as perhaps 3 or 4 quarters ago, that the simulation business is not a business that we look at with the traditional metrics. In other words, driving revenue and how much revenue you're going to be able to derive from it. It's rather, how do you improve the experience of da Vinci surgery, how can you get more people access to training, how do you augment the basic training protocols, and simulation seems to make a lot of sense. If you look at the overall numbers thus far, yes, I think there's -- the market is saying that they like it. The fact that we've sold, I believe, the number is 162 in the first 6 months is very, very promising. But in terms of traditional metrics that you're used to modeling, it really isn't the way we're looking at it.
Operator: And the next question is from Ben Anderson (sic) [Andrew] with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions but maybe switch gears first. The Japanese reimbursement roadmap, is there anything resembling clarity out of them in terms of path forward or steps? I know you talked about it, knowing the roadmap a bit better, but any update there?
Gary Guthart: I guess what I'd say is that there is a small amount of progress and a small of clarity. I think we've mentioned incremental progress in terms of engaging with the key opinion leaders in the right surgical societies that will help us. So I think we're making progress. In terms of clarity and timing, we don't yet have a time that we can predict.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Okay. And they're maybe turning a little bit to the de novo placements. You did I think 67 in the U.S. this quarter, if my math is right. That's a nice uptick over the last couple of quarters, brings you back to where you were previously. I know it's not a conscious decision on your part in terms of targeting those. But can you talk about sort of the incremental revenue opportunity for a de novo system versus say an additional system or a trade-in for the company and whether that might motivate you at some point to target de novo placements.
Gary Guthart: Really the way we think about it is where the procedure is being done and where can we go to fund the procedures. The other thing that we see traditionally, and we're seeing it in hysterectomy as well, is that in general, robotics is a consolidator. So if there is a diffuse patient population out in the small centers, typically you'll see the move towards early adopters of da Vinci technology. I don't think the economics -- the delta and economics between an existing customer sale and a greenfield sale are such that they would motivate us to move toward greenfield. So for the procedures we're in, we're feeling like the mix we have and the strategy we have is pretty sound. And as different procedures come on and their distribution out in the world differs, we may adjust. But for now, I think you're seeing a pretty stable mix.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Okay. And on the operating margin side. You're all the way back up to 39.5%, a little below your target. I know there was some mix maybe in the quarter that helped on that. But are there some investments in market development that you haven't yet implemented, that you hoped to, to hold that margin down assuming that's still your goal? And what might we look for the next, say, 6 quarters in terms of incremental market development efforts from you all?
Calvin Darling: Yes, I think in terms of the overall operating profile, as we stated before, it's not our objective to expand margins here in the second quarter. We probably came out a little ahead on the revenue side and the hiring, there's always the pace of hiring can shift. You're entering into Q3. And we saw last year, revenue was lower in Q3. We're going to continue to add resources to our organization. So I think when you look over longer periods of time, our strategy is not to expand margins, it's to expand the surgery market, the robotic procedure market.
Gary Guthart: Just to put a little color on it where we've been making investments in terms of developing markets. In Europe, we've been bolstering our direct organization in support of growth. And in Japan, we've been bolstering our organization in Japan in anticipation of growth as approvals come. So we've been making those investments, We caught up a little bit in CSR's in the U.S. and now we're kind of keeping pace as we go. We are not trying to catch up anymore, and we're not trying to leverage it hard. We're really trying for kind of slow gains in productivity in the field in the U.S.
Calvin Darling: Yes, and it's kind of complete the thought there. We often times get asked to how many people did you add in the field. Well as Gary said, this quarter, we were pretty consistent with the last quarter. On the clinical side, we added about 24 people to our clinical sales team bringing us up to roughly 515 in that category and we added additional 2 to the clinical side, we're currently about 85. So those rates of hiring within the field sales force are pretty consistent with what we did in Q1.
Operator: And our next question is from Tao Levy with Collins Stewart.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC: It's Tao. Just touching on the reps that you just mentioned. There was this big bolus of hiring that you did in sort of the back half of last year. How do you feel that productivity of those reps, is kind of lining up versus your more seasoned folks?
Marshall Mohr: I think we've been pretty pleased about how they've come on in those general level of productivity. We watched procedures per rep and rep per territory pretty closely as you would imagine. And it takes a while for reps to settle in and hit their full productivity but we're seeing, I think, that return to some metric balance that we're hoping for last year. And now, I think, we're out to catch-up mode, as I said before, and a little bit more in sustained growth.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC: So that's about half way, for some of the season, or is it delivering on procedures?
Marshall Mohr: As you'll imagine, there's a distribution there. Some folks come up to speed very quickly, some people take a little bit longer. But for most of the hiring that was done last year, they're hitting their productivity pretty quick.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC: And have you seen any or noticed any changes to sort of the general macro challenges that you've always faced in selling the value proposition of da Vinci surgery to your customers, either in the U.S. or in Europe, this quarter or even last quarter? Do you see any potential changes versus what you've been experiencing?
Marshall Mohr: So far in the last few quarters, we haven't seen any significant trends. One thing we did see was -- the only thing we did see was really more of our customers finance systems this quarter than they had previously. But we think that has mostly to do with the low interest rates that they're now able to access, and there is plenty of financing for them to obtain. But other than that, there really aren't any trends that I would point out.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC: Okay. And just the last question, on a single decision, you mentioned that you're going to file that this month. Do you expect that to be sort of a 6-month turnaround from the FDA or, I mean, is that kind of a standard turnaround?
Marshall Mohr: I wish I could predict their response. I can tell you that the clinical data we have, we feel really good about. And we'll submit it and we'll support FDA as needed to answer any questions they have.
Operator: And our next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley: This is Jon Demchick in for David. First off, can you quantify the difference in revenue per procedure from, I guess, a Single-Site procedure versus a dVH or a dVP? And also what role, if any, did Fluorescence Imaging Equipment, as well as other new products contribute to revenue and margins in the quarter?
Calvin Darling: Right. On the Single-Site side of things, as you know, we're currently selling directly or selling it to Europe now. Their initial set of customers, as Gary mentioned, is roughly 10 or so sites but their working on that. Here on Single-Site, we are competing directly against some of the laparoscopic tool companies. So it's a little different than the traditional da Vinci side where it's against just open surgery. And so given that, I think there's an established market for Single-Site operations, and I think we're kind of looking at to compete there, perhaps at a slight premium to that. So it would be lower than our traditional set of da Vinci instrument per procedures side on that side. As far as fluorescence imaging goes, we're still pretty early on that, too. The kit is comprised of a couple of endoscopes and some of the dye used in the fluorescence cases. That as you've seen, we've maintained our overall instrument and accessory revenue procedure at about $1,940 over the last 3 quarters and part of that has to do with fluorescence imaging coming on and bolstering the IMA revenue together with the 8.5 millimeters scope. So that could help the small volume right now but in general, it would be a slight increase to the revenue per procedure but not a big impact at this stage.
Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley: Very helpful. And also I know that you touched on Single-Site with the FDA. But for stapling and sealing tools, do you, guys, have any expectations on the time from submission to market or is that still really tough to tell with the FDA? And also, have you needed to kind of go back for more information to appease FDA on any of these products?
Gary Guthart: No. Vessel sealing, we're answering FDA's questions as we speak. The questions are answerable. And stapler has not been submitted.
Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And one more quick one for the trade-ins from S to Si. I believe there are 21 of them. What was the breakdown between U.S. and non-U.S. and how many S Systems are still out there in the market?
Calvin Darling: I believe it was all but 2 were in the U.S.
Marshall Mohr: Were in the U.S. and it's about 750 Ss out in the market worldwide.
Operator: And our next question is from Lennox Ketner.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch: I just want to start on dVP. I know you said that most of the growth came from Europe and that you're not seeing real impact from the activity there. But is it possible just to give a little clarity around what dVP procedures look like the U.S. Whether there was any growth or whether they were flat or what those look like with the U.S.?
Marshall Mohr: Flattish.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay, I'm sorry, is it year-over-year, sequentially, or?
Marshall Mohr: Sequentially.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then on the Single-Site. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on what your plans are in Europe. I know you said you're in 10 sites right now, but kind of how we should expect that rollout to go and when would be in a broader number of sites?
Gary Guthart: Right now, we're still in the early phases of rolling it out. So we continue to add a few sites a month. It's primarily focused on cholecystectomy to start and that's really where we are, and we continue to take data and really our focus now is working with FDA to get it approved.
Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. The data that you submitted to FDA, that was the European data? Is there any chance that we would see that data prior to the U.S. approval, given that it is from Europe or are we unlikely to see that until?
Gary Guthart: The combination of U.S. and European data. I believe there is some abstracts in preparation on the European experience.
Aleks Cukic: Yes, I think, there've been some presentations actually at a few conferences where they've actually showed their data, we're pleased with the data. I think that both procedure times and the metrics that they were measuring, we're very pleased with.
Operator: And the next question is from Larry Keusch with Morgan Keegan.
Lawrence Keusch - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: I'm wondering if you could -- just going back to the stapler. You said that, I believe you said it's still on validation. But can you help us understand what exactly that means and what are the pathway, what is the pathway to getting it submitted?
Gary Guthart: That validation work is pretty much the typical stuff. So it's bench testing and claim validation and sterility validations and all the sets of things you have to do to get ready to submit. And so that's where we are. Some of those tests are -- take a little bit of time and can be extensive in terms of the number units you use in your fire and that's where we are. So we'll walk through that. It's where we expected to be against our plan. And as that gets done then that gets built into a file that will go to FDA.
Lawrence Keusch - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: Okay. Does that imply that the design is frozen and you guys are finished with that and now it's just really the testing of it?
Gary Guthart: Well, the usual process of design is a little bit air lift. So the design, we're feeling comfortable with it. It looks really solid. Now if there's anything in validation we don't like, we go back and touch the design. But generally speaking, we are where we expect to be.
Lawrence Keusch - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then for Aleks and then one quick one for Marshall. And just in terms of the oral surgeries. Again, as you sort of look back over the last 3 months. Where do you see the most interest in the specific procedures within that category, whether it be sleep apnea or medium-sized malignant tumors, et cetera and can you help us sort of think of the sizing of that procedure base?
Aleks Cukic: Well, as far as sleep apnea, that is not a target for us at this stage. I think there have been surgeons that have talked about the procedure and there's certainly have been presentations on it but it's not a specific focus for us at this stage. Most of it is, most of the work is being done on both malignant and benign tumors very consistent with the claims that we have. You'll see tumors that are at the base of tongue, tonsil tumors, and what are really classified as very complex operations. And that's where the majority of the clinical data that's being reported is derived from. As far as that sizing, in our view, we look at that market as probably somewhere between 15,000 to 20,000 procedures and that's really where we are going to stay for a while. I think that's where we add tremendous value. That's where there's a reconsolidation in that space and it's a fairly small community, and we think we can go very deep into that community. So we will focus on that and we'll see where it takes us from there.
Lawrence Keusch - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: Okay. And that 15,000 to 20,000, is that a U.S. number?
Aleks Cukic: Yes, that's a U.S. number.
Lawrence Keusch - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: Okay. For Marshall, I know you haven't lowered the tax rate expectations significantly, but it's a little bit lower than I think you started out the year. Is that just the mix of business towards OUS that's driving that or is there something else to be thinking about?
Marshall Mohr: No. That's exactly right. It's just mix of business and as the mix of business changes to more U.S. then the tax rate will come down.
Operator: The next question is from Mimi Pham with Needham & Company.
Mimi Pham - Weeden & Co., LP: Regarding the number of new surgeons trained on the da Vinci in the first half of this year, can you give us a ballpark of how many per month and how that compares to last year?
Aleks Cukic: I apologize, I don't have that metric, and I don't think it's a metric, honestly, we really reported on probably for last 4 or 5 years. So I don't have that information readily.
Mimi Pham - Weeden & Co., LP: Okay. Your comments about more customer financings for the systems and financing being available. Does that apply for Europe and rest of world also?
Marshall Mohr: It does.
Mimi Pham - Weeden & Co., LP: And can you give us a breakout of what percentage is financing U.S. and international generally?
Marshall Mohr: I don't have the break out between the 2. I can just tell you that in the U.S., we've historically seen over the last year or so about 15%, 16%, to 20% financed. In this quarter, we saw a little over 30%.
Mimi Pham - Weeden & Co., LP: And if that's in the international microenvironment, again you don't see that hurting hospitals international ability to get leasing and financing?
Marshall Mohr: We have not seen any issues with hospitals trying to get that financing to purchase the product.
Marshall Mohr: And last question regarding the pivot data. You expect -- are you hearing kind of noise in the payer community about them reevaluating reimbursement based on pivot data or any kind of noise there?
Aleks Cukic: No. Nothing that we have heard that I can say.
Gary Guthart: We have time for one more question.
Operator: And that question will be from Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.
Unknown Analyst - : This is actually Ken [ph] in for Mike. Quick question on the Single port what sort of trials are you running or where is the data coming from or do you set head-to-head comparisons versus conventional laparoscopic?
Gary Guthart: The data we are running in these trials has been cholecystectomy using our Single-Site product and the comparator has been historically published manual Single-Site.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay, could you give an update on obesity surgery if any updates are available?
Aleks Cukic: I would say that there is. There has been a steady growth in obesity surgery, nothing that is, I would say, steep in its trajectory. But there is a nice study growth and it's grounded in the clinical in the clinical literature is being grounded by things, such as reduced leak rates from double sutured hand, hand sutured anastomosis as opposed to stapled anastomosis. There appears to be more interest in it based on the number of abstracts and the presentations that are provided at the various forums. But it isn't an area that we have really talked a lot about or set high expectations for. But we are pleased with the growth that we're seeing in it. But it's a little less pronounced than some of the other areas that we talk about.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. Thanks. Last question, when you're talking with the hospitals, are you getting a sense or are you hearing that they actually start to ramp up CapEx in anticipation of healthcare reforms?
Gary Guthart: As I've said earlier, we haven't seen any specific trends or changes in the marketplace for the last few quarters.
Gary Guthart: Thank you. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while be focus on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma.  I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. Lyle [ph] of Colorado shares the following experience, "After learning about my 2-inch tumor on my left kidney, I was very scared and nervous. I have a doctor friend that plays golf in my club and he told me about the da Vinci Systems. I was amazed at what he told me. I looked it up on the web, and after learning the difference between the regular surgery and the da Vinci systems, I felt 100% better. Then I had appointment with Dr. Visha [ph] and he explained my condition and the options and I was completely comfortable with thought of surgery. It was my first major surgery and, at 83, I was out of the hospital at the third day and doing some household chores by the fifth day. I live alone and have help for 5 days and I was alone after that. I took pain pills for 3 days and had no pain after that. I could have done without any, but I was told to take them. It is now 2 weeks after surgery and I feel like doing anything I do regularly. I will wait for the 6 weeks before playing golf. However, I'll pitch and putt starting next week. I cannot believe the difference and would like to thank whoever invented this. What a great improvement to surgery. I hope that anyone reading this has a chance of selecting the da Vinci system over the regular surgery. I have talked to someone who had regular surgery in the kidney and our stories are so different like night and day."  Patients like these are our strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We've built our company to take surgery Beyond the Limits of the Human Hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to speaking with you again in 3 months.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Quarter One Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director of Financial Planning for Intuitive Surgical, Mr. Calvin Darling. Please go ahead.
Calvin Darling: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's First Quarter Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning.  Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com, on the Audio Archive section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter's results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will provide present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Marshall will review our first quarter financial results, Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, then I will provide you with an update to our financial forecast for 2011 and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.  With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. In this first quarter, our team has executed well, and we have had solid performance in procedures, system sales and the financial results that follow.  For 2011, we are focused on the following: Extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in gynecology and neurology; expanding robotic surgery and deepening our organizational capability in Europe and Asia; crisp execution in our product development efforts; and enabling emerging procedures in thoracic, transoral and colorectal surgery.  We grew in several specialties and geographies in the quarter. da Vinci Prostatectomy experienced strong growth in the quarter led by continued adoption of dVP in Europe. And gynecology malignant hysterectomy showed continued strength. Benign hysterectomy showed early year seasonality, particularly in January and February. Emerging procedures continue to experience growth in our early adopting centers, in TransOral Robotic Surgery, thoracic surgery and colorectal procedures. Aleks will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call. Turning to operating highlights for the first quarter. Procedures grew 30% over the first quarter of 2010. We sold 120 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 104 during the first quarter of last year. Total revenue was $388 million, up 18% over last year. Instrument and Accessory revenue increased to $157 million, up 28% over Q1 2010. Total recurring revenue grew to $221 million, up 28% from prior year and comprising 57% of total revenue. Net income was $104 million, up 22% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $180 million before noncash stock option expense, up 15% over the first quarter of last year and representing 46% of Q1 revenue.  We ended the quarter with $1,757,000,000 in cash and investments, up $148 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $15 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets and $12 million used in repurchasing stock. Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $60 million from stock proceeds and $53 million used from working capital, we generated $168 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 162% of our reported GAAP net income for the first quarter. As we have mentioned on past calls, we are making significant investments in progress in product development. In Q1, we received the CE mark for our Single-Site da Vinci instruments and accessories. We have begun a stage rollout of Single-Site in Europe focused on Single-Site cholecystectomy. Our early clinical and product performance results there have been encouraging.  In the U.S., the FDA has requested additional clinical data on our Single-Site products. We're in the process of collecting this data in part from our European experience and will provide it to FDA as needed. In the quarter, we received FDA clearance for our da Vinci Fluorescence Imaging System and have likewise begun a staged rollout in the U.S. Whether our initial launch of Single-Site in Europe and Fluorescence Imaging in the U.S., we are focused on an outstanding early customer experience in the development of clinical evidence supporting their use.  We continue to make progress on both our da Vinci vessel sealing instrument and our da Vinci stapler. Our vessel sealer has been submitted to the FDA and we are working through production readiness for this product. Our stapler is undergoing validation work and engineering refinement. We have not yet submitted the stapler for clearance. Lastly, we introduced our da Vinci Surgical Simulator in Q4 of 2010 and shipped our first units and volume in the first quarter. We are working with leading centers on validating simulator tasks and on developing curricular for its use.  As we enter new surgical markets and drive into new product arenas, we continue to invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and then acquiring those technologies that can make a difference through Robotic Surgery. This quarter, we added 69 people to our team predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,729 employees.  I'll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our first quarter revenue was $388 million, up 18% compared with $329 million for the first quarter of 2010, and approximately the same as the $389 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2010.  First quarter revenues by product category were as follows: First quarter Instrument and Accessory revenue was $157 million, up 28% compared with $123 million for the first quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with $151 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increases in Instruments and Accessories are primarily driven by procedure growth.  Instrument and Accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is lower than the first quarter of 2010 by approximately $20 and approximately the same as the fourth quarter of 2010. Relative to the first quarter of 2010, the reduction reflects the lower impact of stocking orders over a larger base of revenue. Relative to the fourth quarter, we had lower stocking orders which were offset by increased orders associated with customer buying patterns. We expect Instruments and Accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time, given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base.  First quarter 2011 Systems revenue of $167 million increased 8% compared with $155 million of Systems revenue for the first quarter of 2010, and decreased 6% compared with $178 million of Systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010.  Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2010, we began delivering new Si Systems for customers S Systems versus converting S Systems into Si systems via field upgrade. The contract terms and economics for these Si for S trade-ins are now more closely reflective of Si sales as a result of the change. Accordingly, we began reporting S to Si trade-ins as system sales. Inclusive of 19 S to Si trade-ins, we sold 120 systems in the first quarter of 2011. This compares to 104 systems in the first quarter of 2010 and 124 systems in the fourth quarter of 2010. I would note that the first quarter of 2010 system count excluded 9 S to Si upgrade that were treated as upgrade revenue, and the fourth quarter of 2010 system count included 10 S to Si trade-ins.  Upgrade revenue for the first quarter of 2011 was approximately $2 million compared to $5 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. Our first quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and S to Si trade-ins but excluding upgrades, was $1.38 million, a decrease from the $1.45 million realized in the first quarter of 2010 and a decrease from the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter. The decrease in average sales price compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 reflects in approximately $1.3 million of revenue associated with simulators that was deferred as the simulators were delivered after the end of the quarter, an increase in the number of S to Si trade-ins for which we offer customer discounts for the return to S product and discounts offered in multi-system purchases. The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior year reflects those factors outlined for the sequential-quarter comparison, combined with the positive product and geographical mix in the first quarter of 2010. Service revenue increased to $64 million, up 26% compared with $51 million last year and up 5% compared with $61 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base.  Total first quarter recurring revenue comprised of Instrument, Accessories and Service revenue, increased to $221 million, up 28% compared with the first quarter of 2010 and up 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represented 57% of total first quarter revenue compared with 53% in the first quarter last year and 54% last quarter.  International results were as follows: Outside the U.S., procedures grew 38% on a year-to-year basis, with dVP in Europe being the greatest driver, although we experienced growth in our other target procedures including dVH in Europe. First quarter revenue outside the U.S. was $91 million, up 32% compared with revenue of $69 million in the first quarter of 2010, and down 5% compared with revenue of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Instrument and accessory revenue grew 39% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. We sold 31 systems outside the U.S. compared with 24 in the first quarter of 2010 to 38 last quarter. We sold 15 systems in Europe this quarter compared with 11 in the first quarter of 2010 and 28 last quarter. The fourth quarter has historically been the seasonally strongest quarter for system sales in Europe. Five of the systems sold in the first quarter were to Japanese customers. However, the tsunami and follow-on issues are expected to curtail sales in Japan for the foreseeable future. Aleks will provide these additional details of overseas system sales. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the first quarter was 72% compared with the first quarter 2010 gross margin of 73% and compared with fourth quarter 2010 gross margin of 73%. The decreases compared to prior periods primarily reflects decreased system ASPs.  First quarter 2011 operating expenses of $131 million were up 18% compared with the first quarter of 2010 and up 2% compared with the fourth quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter. We added 69 employees during the quarter, including 48 employees in our commercial operations organization and 18 employees in product operation. First quarter 2011 operating income was $148 million or 38% of sales compared with $130 million or 39% of sales for the first quarter of 2010 and $154 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2010. First quarter 2011 operating income reflected $32 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $27 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $30 million last quarter. The year-over-year growth to noncash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of each year. Our effective tax rate for the first year -- for the first quarter of 32% was lower than our 2010 rate of 33%. The reduction in rates between years reflects lower state taxes and a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S. The first quarter rate was also favorably impacted by the benefit of stock option exercise. Our net income was $104 million or from $2.59 per share, compared with $85 million or $2.12 per share for the first quarter of 2011 and $121 million or $3.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2010.  Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and investments of $1,757,000,000, up $148 million compared with December 31, 2010. The increase was driven by $100 million of cash flows from operations plus $60 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $12 million of stock buyback and $15 million of capital and IP purchases. During the first quarter we bought back 36,000 shares at an average price of $323 per share. As of March 31, there were $389 million of the board authorized buybacks remaining. Our stock buyback program remains active, and we intend to utilize the authorization to offset dilution created by stock options.  Our accounts receivable balance increased to $260 million at March 31 from $247 million at December 31, reflecting the timing of receivables and collections. There was no change in the quality of our receivables during the quarter.  Our inventory increased to $93 million at March 31 from $87 million at December 31. The increase reflects steps taken to increase component inventory where supplies have tightened and have build up finished goods to reduce the risk of supply disruption as we move our manufacturing operations to our new building in Sunnyvale at the end of the second quarter.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the first quarter, we sold 120 da Vinci Systems, 89 in the United States, 15 in Europe and 16 in rest of the world markets. As part of the 120 system sales, 13 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems and 19 S systems were traded in for Si Systems. We had a net 88 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,840, the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide, 1,344 in the U.S., 330 in Europe and 166 in rest of world markets. 51 of the 120 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. In total, 110 of the 120 systems sold during the quarter represented da Vinci Si Systems, which included 15 dual console systems. The 31 system sales internationally included five da Vinci systems into Japan, four into Australia and three into the countries of Germany, France and Turkey.  Clinically, we had a solid quarter, achieving overall year-over-year procedure growth of approximately 30%. Neurology and thoracic showed particularly solid sequential strength. On a year-over-year basis, the categories of thoracic, head and neck, GYN, colorectal and general surgery displayed the strongest growth.  As we previously discussed, Q1 is a seasonally challenged quarter for surgeries that could be classified as discretionary, which causes some early year lumpiness within benign gynecologic procedures. Consistent with Q1 2010 procedure trends, malignant dVH showed greater sequential strength than benign dVH during the quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, benign dVH is growing at a faster rate than malignant dVH. The overall category of da Vinci GYN surgery grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis. We would expect to see normal dVH cycles resume for the remainder of the year. Within urology, our dVP business remains strong and particularly so outside the United States, specifically within Europe. France and Germany are coming up the curb nicely, and Italy remains strong. We described our U.S. dVP business as relatively flat over the past several quarters. However, on a sequential basis, it can fluctuate a bit, and in Q1, it showed sequential strength. Having said that, we believe the greatest opportunity for growth will continue to be fueled from the OUS markets. At last year's European Association of Urology Conference, da Vinci related presentations, abstracts and postgraduate courses dominated the agenda, and the live surgery presentations were projected into standing-room only audiences. And at next month's AUA Conference, over 200 da Vinci-related abstracts have already been accepted. In addition, 16 AUA postgraduate courses will include da Vinci. dVP growth and urology in general remains strong and is certainly a catalyst for many of our OUS system placements.  Regarding Japan, as you can imagine, the catastrophic earthquake and subsequent tsunami have caused significant disruptions to the healthcare system and has placed a tremendous burden on all Japanese government resources. The five da Vinci sales in Japan had occurred prior to these tragic events. We would expect uncertainty within Japan to prevail for some time to come and we will share more as it becomes known. During the quarter, over 200 clinical papers were presented at various conferences and/or within peer review journals. But I'll take a moment to highlight just a few. In the recent edition of the journal Gynecologic Oncology, Doctors Lim and Kang et al, published a paper entitled a Comparative Detailed Analysis of the Learning Curve and Surgical Outcome for Robotic Hysterectomy with Lymphadenectomy versus Laparoscopic Hysterectomy with Lymphadenectomy in Treatment of Endometrial Cancer: A Case-Matched Controlled Study of the first 122 Patients. The goal was to determine the learning curve and surgical outcome for the first 122 robotic hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy patients in comparison to the first 122 patients who underwent the same procedure laparoscopically. The learning curve of the surgical procedure was determined by measuring operative time with respect to chronological order of each patient who had undergone their respective procedure. Number of lymph nodes, estimated blood loss, days of hospitalization and complications of all patients were also analyzed and compared. Data were analyzed by mean age, body mass index, operative time, estimated blood loss, lymph node retrieval and complications for both surgical procedures.  In their results, they reported the mean operated time was approximately 40 minutes shorter for the dVH cohort as compared to the traditional laparoscopic cohort. The mean estimated blood loss was statistically significant at 81 milliliters for da Vinci hysterectomy compared to 207 milliliters for the laparoscopic approach. The days of hospitalization for the dVH patients was 1.5 days compared to 3.2 days for the laparoscopic group. The number of intraoperative complications in the dVH group was one as compared to seven within the lap group.  The authors concluded by saying, and I quote, "Robotic hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy has a faster learning curve in comparison to laparoscopic hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy. The adequacy of the surgical staging was comparable between the two surgical methods. Robotic hysterectomy is associated with shorter hospitalization, less blood loss and less intraoperative and major complications, and lower rate of conversion to open procedure."  The interest in da Vinci from the thoracic community is increasing rapidly. In addition to lobectomies, we're seeing interest in thoracic pull-through procedures such as mediastinal mass resections. While the procedure numbers may be relatively small, the patient value is potentially very high. In a recent edition of the European Journal of Cardio-thoracic Surgery, a paper out of the University of Antwerp in Belgium authored by Doctors Balduyck and Hendriks et al entitled, Quality of Life After Anterior Mediastinal Mass Resection: A Prospective Study Comparing Open with Robotic-Assisted Thoracoscopic Resection, was published. The objective was to prospectively evaluate quality of life evolution after robotic-assisted thoracoscopic resection as compared to open anterior mediastinal tumor resection. The authors used a validated European quality of life questionnaire. Quality of life was prospect of all patients undergoing surgery for mediastinal tumors. A total of 36 patients underwent thoracoscopic resection using either the da Vinci robotic system or a sternotomy-based open resection. Questionnaires were administered before surgery and at one, three, six and 12 months, postoperatively, with response rates of 100%, 86%, 94% and 75% respectively.  The results were as follows: Both approaches had comparable preoperative patient characteristics and quality of life subscales. Open resection by sternotomy was characterized by a significant decrease in general functioning one month after surgery, both physical and social. Patients also complained of increased thoracic pain in the first three months post-surgery. Following a da Vinci robotic resection, quality of life scores approximated the baseline preoperative scores one month after surgery. In other words, there were no reduction in patient function scores at the first postoperative quality of life measurement. The authors' conclusion, and I quote, "Numerous techniques have been published with different degrees of invasiveness, generating the existing controversy as to which is the best surgical approach for anterior mediastinal tumors. The high burden of decreased physical functioning reported after sternotomy is not seen after the da Vinci robotic-assisted thoracoscopic resection. The initial experience and postoperative quality of life data are excellent and, therefore, the da Vinci robot will stay our future technique of choice for the treatment of resectable mediastinal tumors measuring less than 4 centimeters." The patient value of replacing large thoracotomies and/or sternotomies with a small, minimally invasive incision is significant, which is one of the reasons why thoracic surgery has become one of our fastest-growing specialties.  In closing, I'll remind you that the second quarter marks the peak of our busy global conference season, with the AUA, ACOG, AATS and the American Society of Colorectal Surgery Conference is taking place, to name a few. We will provide you with the clinical highlights from some of these conferences during next quarter's call.  That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn the time over the Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with an update to our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates for significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows.  Starting with procedures. Our first quarter 2011 procedures grew approximately 30% compared to the first quarter of last year. Based upon our latest projections and consistent with our previous forecast, we continue to expect our total procedures for 2011 to grow approximately 25% to 28% for the year from approximately 278,000 procedures performed in 2010. Moving on to revenues. Our 2011 total revenue forecast also remains unchanged compared to our previous quarter's estimates. Our Q1 2011 revenues increased 18% compared to Q1 of last year. We continue to expect our full year 2011 revenue to grow approximately 16% to 20% for the year.  With regard to gross margin. On our last call, we estimated our 2011 gross margin percentage to fall between 72% and 73% of revenue. Our first quarter 2011 gross profit margin of 71.8% was just below this range as system ASPs and product margins were impacted by higher da Vinci S trade-in volume, a factor that we expect to continue going forward. We now anticipate our full year 2011 gross margin percentage to come in at the lower end of the 72% to 73% range forecast on our last call. Moving to operating expense. We continue to invest across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. Consistent with our last call, we anticipate growing operating expenses between 16% and 20% in 2011 in line with our top line growth. In terms of noncash expenses, we continue to expect 2011 noncash stock compensation to total between $140 million and $145 million, up from $118 million reported in 2010. And we continue to expect 2011 amortization of purchased intellectual property to total between $17 million and $20 million. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, is expected to come in at the higher end of the $17 million to $18 million range forecast on our last call. With regard to income tax driven primarily by lower state income tax estimates, we are now reducing our tax rate forecast to 33% of pretax income from 34% forecast on our last call. We estimate that our diluted share counts for calculating Q2 2011 earnings per share will be approximately 40.3 million shares. We aim to keep the share count around this level throughout the balance of 2011 which is equal to our 2010 average.  Finally, regarding our cash flows. Since we're forecasting to report over $157 million in noncash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our full year cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operation is a better measure of our actual financial performance than net income. During Q1, we repurchased and retired $12 million of our common stock. Entering Q2, we have $389 million remaining authorized by the board to purchase additional shares. Our repurchase program is active, and we expect to increase our level of repurchases going forward. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Bill Andrew (sic) [Ben Andrew], representing William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask here, if I might, plans for continued hiring. You've been growing the organization very rapidly, trying to scale into some new significant opportunities. How far have you come in that process? And can you give us a thought on maybe how many more quarters we would see this above trend hiring or is this now the new trend?
Gary Guthart: Yes. I think it'll start to temper as a percentage of the base and it already has actually in Q1 from Q4. So we'll continue to hire but not quite at the same percent growth rate. The two barbells that have been commanding most of the hiring has been the clinical side in the field as we try to get territory's balance for the right procedure for rep coverage. And I think our coverage is getting pretty close to where we want it. It's really now just filling open territories as needed, and then a little bit on the R&D and operations side to support programs as we're growing. So I think you'll see a temper. We'll continue to hire but it will start to temper.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: And then maybe a question for Aleks. If my math is right, did you add 59 de novo systems in the U.S. this quarter?
Aleks Cukic: Give me a second on that.
Aleks Cukic: It should be close to that...
Aleks Cukic: I believe it's 59.
Gary Guthart: That is correct. It is 59.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: So my question is, as you look at that rate, it has come down a little bit from, say, the Q4 and Q1 were a bit below the trend you had seen in the previous three or four quarters for de novo U.S. placements. How do you think about the pipeline of potential new hospital is flowing in? And you did mention kind of multi-system orders, but just talk a little bit about the flow of potential customers for de novo systems in the U.S. if you would.
Aleks Cukic: So I believe 89 systems in the U.S. represents a new high watermark for us. So the flow of systems into the United States remains very strong. What we probably have a more difficult time assessing on a go-forward basis is at what rate existing customers want to upgrade, either their Standard system or their S System to the Si System. I know it's a little different than the question you asked about the de novo system, but as you look at the activity that the sales organization has to go through to trade out a system and trade up or cultivate a new de novo system, it isn't that there is an enormous difference in the time required to get one done versus the other. So as we look at the overall system placement in the United States, it remains important for us to continue to either get our customers into the Si Systems or cultivate new green field. I don't know that there's a trend that we can point out that says this is going to continue. I think it'll probably oscillate up and down a bit as we go forward, and that's probably the most -- the best visibility we have.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Okay. And then as you think about satisfying the needs of the customer across multiple specialties, it sounds like you're seeing some pickup in the number of multi-system orders or hospitals with obviously recurring orders. So is that more important to you, if you will, as developing maybe [indiscernible] -- is that obviously a point of focus for the company, trying to grow that installed base of existing and strong customers, maybe even more important than driving new customer installations?
Aleks Cukic: It's hard to say again and I think you caught yourself in the question, and I think that's probably the way we'd answer it. It's hard to say what is the most important. I would say this, that when you have customers who are coming back and buying second, third, fourth or fifth system, I believe we now have five hospitals that have six systems, and they build very comprehensive programs. That's very valuable for us, both regionally and nationally. And so, I don't want to diminish from that, but at the same time, opening up a new store, if you will, the analogy being same-store sales versus new stores, is also important. The most important element is driving into those stores and keeping the shelves full with procedures. And so that happens both ways. So we're really not going to pick and choose as to which one is a little more valuable or a little less valuable. They're very valuable to us and we'll continue to operate that way.
Operator: Mr. Peterson, your line is open. [JPMorgan Chase]
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just starting out with ASPs. A little bit obviously some give and takes with mix here. Can you just talk about where you see ASPs maybe on da Vinci progressing for the rest of the year, and maybe talk about -- you talked about the Simulator impacting this quarter. Does that carry over as we go forward?
Gary Guthart: The Simulator impact for the quarter was we had greater demand than we had anticipated going into the quarter, and so there were 32 systems that we did not deliver in the quarter and we've delivered those early in the second quarter. It's about $1.3 million worth of revenue. So that has a $10,000 impact on ASPs for the quarter. And to your question, that does carry over into Q2. But I wouldn't expect ASPs to vary greatly from where we are today.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And was there any contribution from the Si-e?
Gary Guthart: Si-e, very little. We had three Si-e units in the quarter.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then on sales, can you just talk about the market opportunity within Europe, what with yearly traction is like? And then any additional color you can provide on what the FDA is asking for here in the U.S.?
Gary Guthart: I'll start with kind of the initial experience, Aleks can talk a little bit about the broader activity. So far, we're starting in cholecystectomy. The first experiences have been great. We've seen good procedure outcomes, low complication rates all been cholecystectomy, good learning curves. So our early opening experience in Europe has been really strong. And the conversation with FDA is really centered around indications per use and the clinical data to support that, so we're collecting additional data and we'll provide it to them per their request, and off we go. Cholecystectomy is clearly the place we're going to start and where it takes us from there will require some procedural development and additional medical research, but I'll let Aleks take...
Aleks Cukic: Yes. I'll just say, Tycho, you've been following us for a while and I think when we go into a procedure category, we tend to be very diligent, very careful as to how we roll out the launch. And so as you can imagine, to Gary's comments, we had a few centers that were up and running. We're really trying to validate the procedure, we're trying to understand sort of the nuances of the procedure and the choreography of the procedure, and then in a very step-wise and thoughtful manner, expanding it a little bit at a time. And so that's really the approach that we have, whether it's Europe or anywhere else. In terms of the overall market, it's way too early for us to really claim what that size might be. I think there's probably an update out there that suggest what the laparoscopic cholecystectomy market is, but that's not what we're saying our opportunity is. We'll figure it out and we'll do it thoughtfully and we'll share more information as it becomes available.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I guess as we think about colorectal, can you talk to some of the momentum coming out of SAGES from the physician community and any additional commentary you can provide coming out of the conference?
Gary Guthart: Yes, I think colorectal in general, if you look at -- again, it's been a very rapid ascent into that market. Now we're dealing off a small base just to level set. But what is very interesting is that each quarter that goes by, we tend to have a greater awareness in the community. And when I say the community, we're talking about the board-certified colon and rectal surgeons, independent of the interest that general surgeons might have with some of them do colorectal procedures. But when you really look at the colorectal specialty, you have to look at the board-certified colorectal surgeons. And the data that was disseminated and the discussions at stages and the general awareness of it in that community is growing pretty rapidly. We've said all along that we think that there are some products that will be required to fully optimize the opportunity, be it stapling, be it a vessel sealing platform and suction/irrigation and so on, but we're very pleased at the rate of growth despite having the perfectly optimized system.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then just last one on TransOral. Can you just talk as to how interesting that market's becoming? I guess we get a few more questions on the margin on that opportunity lately and if you could just talk to whether it's sleep apnea or other areas that are expanding pretty quickly, that'd be helpful.
Gary Guthart: Where we've set our initial targets is really where we remain today, and that's in the base of tongue in some of the malignant cancers, tonsil cancers -- I should say the base of tongue cancers and some of the benign conditions there resections as well as the tonsil cancers, et cetera. As far as sleep apnea, there's really not a lot that we can share there. I know there have been people that have talked about it, but we're aware of the interest people have there. But our focus is really into the high-value procedures today that we've identified with our customers and we'll continue to drive there.
Operator: And next, we will go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley: This is actually Jon Demchick in for David. First off, on the trade-ins of Si, the former upgrades, I believe there were 19 of them. What was the breakdown between U.S. and EU? And how many S Systems are still out there?
Gary Guthart: I think it was two international trade-ins of which one was a Standard and one was an S. The rest would have been U.S.
Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley: On procedure adoption with Single-Site in Europe and soon to be in the U.S. and then also the stapling and sealing tools in development, can you give us any more clarity on the launch times of these as well as the main procedures that you're targeting with these devices, and how you guys are looking at the adoption curves?
Aleks Cukic: I think there's really not a lot of more detail we can provide on prospective launch dates. I think we, again, I think, label them as either in with the FDA or soon-to-be and/or will at some point be in with the FDA. Beyond that, once it gets into that position, it's difficult to really say. In terms of the opportunities or the market, I think again with the Single-Site System, the initial target is going to be cholecystectomy with respect to the stapler. Staplers are used in a variety of applications ranging from general surgery to colorectal, to lung, to GYN oncology and so on and so forth. So I would envision that following along in parallel to where our procedure efforts are going that require a stapler and I think the same thing could be settled with vessel sealing.
Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley: And lastly, last quarter we saw international placements up around 40, and this year they were, I guess, a little bit above 30. Is the system placements a reflection of the strength in the same countries like Germany, Italy and France, or is it more a result of just broad adoption? Also with the European box trend, is that more of a result of just increased traction or is it easing in austerity?
Aleks Cukic: Yes. I think if you look at the comparison you made, and you can back test this for years, Q4 is the strongest market, assuming the strongest period for system sales outside the United States, and Q1 is traditionally, along with Q3, among the slowest. And so, there's really no surprise to us in terms of 31 systems as opposed to 38, I believe, we did last year -- excuse me, last quarter. So I think we're actually pleased with 31. The market, again, the breakouts, we introduced, I think, for the first time, talking about Australia. We haven't talked about Australia in a while, we haven't talked about Turkey in a while. Those are markets that again are coming on and certainly come on this quarter. And then Germany, and France and Italy remain very important markets to the EU. In terms of austerity measures, there really isn't, I think, a lot more for us to share there. We've seen it oscillate up and down over the past year or perhaps six quarters, and there's really nothing new for us to add there.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Rick Wise representing Leerink Swann.
Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann LLC: It's Miroslava for Rick tonight. Can we talk a little bit about Japan. I appreciate the commentary that with the tragic situation that we have over there, there's probably going to be little update. But just prior to that, you had a pretty strong quarter. Is there something new that you can share with us on the reimbursement front?
Gary Guthart: Not really anything new we can tell you. We continue to work down the process there, which is a combination of working with our partners and collecting data and working with surgical societies likewise. But I can't give you any update on the time line.
Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann LLC: Okay, no updates. And secondly maybe on the increase in da Vinci S upgrades. It seems to me, if I'm looking at my model at least correctly, it seems like it's a pretty significant step up from what you've done from the nine to 10 upgrades you've done historically to something like 19 this quarter. Is there a reason why -- and you anticipate this continuing. What are the drivers there that you suddenly see this -- we see a bit of a step up there and you expect to see it continuing?
Aleks Cukic: Again, I think in terms of the expectations, we don't really go into a particular quarter or particular time period and say we would expect this many customers to participate in an upgrade program. We try that through the communication with our sales organization, understand what the range might be, if you will. But what the customer ultimately decides to do is really up to the customer, and we will help facilitate whichever transaction they wanted, if they own a Standard and they want to get into an Si, we've got a program to help facilitate that. The same is true with the S. I can't out point at one event-driven activity that has caused an uptick from 10 to 19. But again, we've got a few quarters of this now under our belt and I think you can start to plot it and develop -- some trends are developing there and we just have no reason to think that it's either going to grow materially or decrease materially.
Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann LLC: Okay, thank you. And lastly, there is a study coming up at AUA that some physicians have pointed to us maybe interesting in terms of evaluating watchful waiting versus radical prostatectomy. Do you anticipate any sort of impact from this study? And what could this mean for your prostatectomy rates in the U.S.?
Aleks Cukic: It's really hard to say. If I'm not mistaken, that study has been -- patients have been enrolled in that study from the '90s and there's a long-term follow-up on it, and that's great. I mean, I think you get long-term results. Unfortunately, you have to go through long periods of time. And I would suspect that there are only a few, if any, da Vinci Prostatectomies that are part of that cohort. And so, I think the watchful waiting versus surgery versus radiation debate will be with us for a long time. I don't know that there is anything that we would expect one direction or the other based on that particular study. I'm glad it's being done. I think good science needs to be done in a lot of different areas within prostate cancer, and we'll see what the results say.
Operator: The next question is from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping to come back to gross margins. I know you talked a little bit about ASPs negatively impacting numbers, but if I look at the product gross margin, it looks like that was down from 75.5% in the prior year quarter down to sort of 73.9%. Maybe you could help us sort of understand a little bit more the dynamics on the gross margin anything beyond ASPs. And then maybe a follow-on on the ASPs. As you’re selling repeat systems, are you seeing the ASPs on those systems the same as when you're selling systems to de novo accounts?
Gary Guthart: Yes. So the product gross profit that you mentioned, yes, 74.5% in Q4 down to 73.9%, so we're talking about 0.6 point here. And I think we tried to highlight the biggest factor out there which would be the ASPs for the decline of product margins, specifically the higher volume of S trade-ins which are going to carry a higher customer credit which helps to inform the sales discount. So that's the biggest factor, I think. We talked a little bit about the Simulator, too. And the Simulator, it's being bundled in with a lot of these sales in the quarter, and there's some cost that goes at the Simulator and at the same time, the ASP was steady to down. So the scenario we've set all along that we're going to be investing in our business in areas where we think we can grow procedures and drive adoption of robotic surgery, and I think the Simulator is one of those areas of investment that they kind of see on the gross margin line.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then just on the ASPs, if you look at the centers to which you were selling second, third or fourth systems, et cetera, when you're making a repeat systems sales to any of those hospitals are the -- for the ASP there, are you recognizing something that's close to what you're recognizing on when you're making a new sale to a new hospital?
Marshall Mohr: There's not a significant difference between the ASPs and follow-on systems versus initial system sales.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then lastly, on the procedure volume side, I think in several examples you've talked about prostatectomy sort of flattish and then some seasonal gyrations on the benign hysterectomy side of the business. Would you say that -- does that mean that the vast majority of the sequential growth in procedures really came from outside of your 2 core procedures just on a sequential basis that the incremental procedures are becoming increasingly comprised of head and neck, for example, and some of the non-GYN, non-urological procedures?
Aleks Cukic: I would say that the urologic procedures grew, and this is one of the quarters that we talked about. And I mentioned in my commentary from time to time in the United States. And we've talked about dVP being flattish for several quarters, but there are quarters where you will see some pretty -- some nice sequential strength and Q1 was one of them. So we -- in addition to seeing the OUS growth and specific to Europe, we saw U.S. growth. So there was -- the category of neurology was a decent contributor to the incremental sequential growth. This growing category of Other, I think you're right. I think when you look at the category of Other, it tends to grow at a faster rate, then the blend of the two main line procedures. And so nothing really different there. And I think you highlighted the sequential, or I should say, the seasonal challenge with some of the benign procedures, specifically dVH that you start to see in the early part of the year that tends to sort of correct itself as we get out beyond the first few months.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Tao Levy with Collins Stewart.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC: So Aleks, maybe you could mention you could talk a little bit about the benefits of the vessel sealing device that they sent to the FDA, and not only on sort of the types of procedures versus kind of the other vessel sealing products that are readily available to da Vinci users, and also the benefit to the P&L, if any, or the impact?
Aleks Cukic: Well, yes, as far as benefits, I'm going to be very careful. As you know, without having FDA clearance, you're not to be making claims on a particular product, so I'm going to be careful not to make any claims. I think in the category of vessel sealing, what tends to be the target is moving into a larger -- moving into a larger vessel and some of them, again, you're taking significantly larger vessels than you would with traditional bipolar or other forms of elective surgery. That's the target. As you know with the da Vinci instrument, you get articulation and get control, so we look to bring all of those things to the product. But in terms of making benefit claims, I’ll wait and preserve that until we get the product through the FDA and out the market, we can actually make those claims. And as far as the P&L, there's really not much we can comment on there because the product isn't priced and it's not in the market yet. So we do believe that a vessel sealer in some of the complex procedures, which we've become accustomed to operating in will add value. But that's about as far as I think we can really talk about it.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC: Okay. And a couple other pipeline products, is the Single-Site experience in Europe, maybe you can comment on the price point of that technology at this point?
Gary Guthart: Right now, it's priced at a slight premium to the manual products in the market and a little bit lower than typical da Vinci instrument kit just directionally.
Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC: Okay, perfect. And then lastly, what are your early thoughts on the Fluorescence Imaging? You're starting to see some press releases out of some of the hospitals with some initial procedures on that technology. Where do you think it potentially could add the most value in that area?
Gary Guthart: Good question. For us, it's a little bit of a platform technology and this is really the first indication for it. So the current clearance is for vascular imaging. So it's being used in partial nephrectomy and some colorectal and allows surgeons to understand profusion. There are other potentials for Fluorescence Imaging that we're working on that will have subsequent follow-on clearances that will have subsequent follow-on clearances that will allow us to take in other directions. So I think generally speaking, directionally, what it does is allow surgeons to see some structures beyond the tissue surface and do more precise dissection than they would otherwise be able to do. I think it'll be a slow build for us as we gain experience, as the publications come out. So far, the early use of it is encouraging, but I think it will take some time to get that built into our procedure packages and into our clinical publications, and we have some follow-on indications we'd like to pursue.
Operator: Our final question today comes from the line of Mimi Pham with Weeden & Co.
Mimi Pham - Weeden & Co., LP: Do you have any target in terms of Single-Site in Europe? Do you have a target of how many sites you want to be at by the end of the year?
Aleks Cukic: We don't, and I would just say that if the first quarter where we really started to commercialize it and it'd be difficult for us to assess what that number is going to be at the end of the year.
Mimi Pham - Weeden & Co., LP: Okay. And then in terms of the U.S. mission for Single-Site, I mean, I know you're saying you're -- do you have everything you need to resubmit in the current quarter? Is that something that might take you through year end to get all the FDA -- all the data to the FDA?
Gary Guthart: Some of that data, we're currently collecting now, so I don't know exactly when we'll have it all in our hands but it's not all sitting right now on the dockets. We'll have to do some of the work to get it done.
Mimi Pham - Weeden & Co., LP: And when you say work, you mean additional clinical work?
Gary Guthart: Yes, there's clinical work to be done.
Mimi Pham - Weeden & Co., LP: Okay. And then in terms of your procedure growth of being 30% this quarter but you still kept your guidance for the year 25% to 28%, can you just talk about -- do you expect that year-over-year growth through the year to decline throughout the quarters or in terms...
Aleks Cukic: Well, I guess that's implied in the guidance. I mean, mathematically, that has to be the case. If you look at Q4 last year, it was 35%. Now we're in Q1, it was down to 30%, so we know this was seasonally a lighter quarter in some of our benign procedures. But I think still the math is as you described it, I think the year-over-year growth in the outer quarters would be slightly down from here.
Mimi Pham - Weeden & Co., LP: Okay. So I guess just implied by that, you're not expecting sort of an uptick in the back half of the year from Single-Site to keep that level [indiscernible]?
Gary Guthart: Nothing like that will be built in to the numbers here. As Aleks said, it's just too early to forecast what that maybe.
Mimi Pham - Weeden & Co., LP: Okay. Thank you for the clarification.
Gary Guthart: Thank you. That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients.  One experience comes from Jenn in Ohio who had a da Vinci surgery for endometriosis. After several laparoscopies that removed some but not all of the endometriosis, she writes, "In the meantime, I had lost my job. I had to take pain medications throughout each day and it just barely touched my pain. I couldn't drive, cook or clean. Some days I couldn't even drag myself out of bed. I had to rely on my family for everything. I felt absent from my son, my husband and my entire life. Finally, a friend contacted me and told me about Dr. Ross Marchetta and how he helped her after years of being misdiagnosed by several doctors. Thank God she did. He informed me of the da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery and explained that I was a perfect candidate. He was the first doctor who was confident he could help me. In June of 2010, I had my da Vinci robotic-assisted laparoscopy. Using the robot, Dr. Marchetta was able to remove all of my endo lesions, both fibroids and my fallopian tube and cystic ovary. My ovary was growing into my kidney, and if it would've remained untreated much longer, it could have caused serious damage. Dr. Marchetta called my case one of the worst he had ever treated and said he would call it Stage V, if there was such a stage. He was thrilled with the work he was able to accomplish and explained that he never could have achieved this amazing result without the robot. He called my surgery a miracle. It was miraculous. He gave me back my life. I weaned off my pain medication. On the 4th of July, my family and I attended a friend's party, the first fun I had, had all year. I felt like myself again. My pain was completely gone. I returned to my normal everyday life as a mom, wife and writer. On my birthday, I celebrated my health by parasailing, an activity on my bucket list. If people had told me this was possible during those previous dark months, I never would've believed them. Dr. Marchetta and the da Vinci robot saved my life. My family and I will be forever grateful."  Patients like Jenn are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.  This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2010 was a year with some broad challenges and encouraging trends. In the year, our procedure mix shifted in favor of gynecology, as it eclipsed urology as the largest specialty we serve. We are making good progress in responding to the challenges inherent in our expanding business.  In 2010, our focus was in four areas: first, driving the adoption of da Vinci surgery within the gynecology market; second, enabling growth of new procedures within new specialties; third, the expansion of our business internationally; and fourth, rightsizing our various core teams within the company to support our growth, most notably our sales organization.  Looking back at the full year 2010, our operating highlights were as follows. Worldwide procedures grew by 35%, with international procedures growing by 42%. We sold 441 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year, up from 338. Total revenue grew to $1.413 billion, up 34%. Recurring revenue grew to $753 million, up 34% and comprising 53% of total revenue. We generated $673 million in operating profit before noncash stock compensation expense, up 42% from last year. And GAAP net income grew to $382 million, up 64% year-over-year.  Now turning to operating highlights for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew 35%. We sold 124 da Vinci Surgical Systems. We ended the fourth quarter with 1,752 da Vinci systems installed worldwide. Total revenue for the quarter was $389 million. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $151 million, up 33%. Total recurring revenue including service grew to $212 million, comprising 54% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $184 million in the quarter before noncash stock compensation expense, up 20% from the fourth quarter of last year. And GAAP net income grew to $121 million, up 56%.  We ended the year with $1.609 billion in cash and investments, down $12 million from last quarter and up $437 million from last year. We received $141 million in cash during the year from the exercise of stock options and invested $79 million in intellectual property, working capital, property plant and equipment and $199 million in stock repurchases for the year. Going forward, we will continue to look for stock repurchase opportunities.  Gross cash from operations for the year were $573 million, or $14.22 per fully diluted share and 150% of our reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of the significant noncash stock option and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason that we believe that gross cash generated from operations remains the best measure of our financial performance. In our adopting procedures in the U.S., da Vinci Hysterectomy continued its strong growth, both in malignant and benign conditions, growing 59% year-over-year. Sacrocolpopexy and Myomectomy also continued to track their adoption curves. Urology also grew for the full year of 2010 through the continued adoption of Partial Nephrectomy and growth in dVP, the latter being focused in Europe.  As benign conditions became a larger part of our procedure base in the U.S., we experienced increased exposure to seasonality and other patient treatment deferrals that are less common with cancer operations. We expect this exposure to be an ongoing part of our business.  2010 was a strong year for emerging procedures. In fact, procedures falling outside the above-mentioned adopting procedures grew by 47% over 2009. Among procedures in new specialties that may emerge as adoptions are da Vinci colorectal procedures, da Vinci thoracic procedures and da Vinci transoral head and neck procedures. Patient value in these specialties appears to be high, and surgeon interest and early growth has been encouraging. I'll leave it to Aleks to provide more detail on our progress later in the call.  We are pleased with our procedure adoption in Europe in 2010, helped by growing depths in our European sales team. European procedures grew 48% year-over-year led by urology. We also saw the emergence of da Vinci surgery for cancer indications and gynecologic surgery in Europe.  2010 has been an investment year for products, with several of them in the mid to late stages of development. We believe these products will optimize existing procedures and enable new ones. In Q4, we launched our da Vinci Si stimulator, which, in combination with our Dual Console, afford surgeons more opportunity to train on da Vinci and track their progress. Our Single Site product is in the late stages of regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe. Recall that this product is intended to facilitate da Vinci's single incision surgeries on existing Si systems. Our robotic stapling and vessel sealing products are in development, and our progress with these products is encouraging.  In imaging, our fluorescence imaging product is also in the late stages of the regulatory review progress in the U.S. and Europe. In 2010, we also connected the majority of our installed da Vinci systems to a da Vinci network that enables remote system, performance monitoring as well as remote proctoring. We continue to invest in technologies that improve and enhance surgical imaging. Likewise, we also continuously invest in robotic technologies that simplify and enhance access to the body.  Finally, as we've discussed on prior calls, we believed at the outset of 2010 that investments were required in our clinical sales force to support the continued expansion of gynecologic and emerging procedures in the U.S. We added 150 members to our clinical team through the year and have largely caught back up to the procedure to sales rep run rate that we believe supports our customers' needs during this period. Across the company, we added nearly 400 employees in 2010, ending the year with 1,660 people on our team.  In closing, our priorities for 2011 are as follows: first, continuing our growth in gynecology and urology through outstanding execution in the field; second, disciplined execution of our product development process through product launch; third, driving deeper within the emerging procedures of colorectal surgery, thoracic surgery and transoral surgery through procedure and product development with leading customers; and fourth, strengthening our team both in the U.S. and in international markets to support the continued growth of the business.  I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer, to take us through our financial performance in greater detail.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Our fourth quarter revenue was $389 million, up 21% compared with $323 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 13% compared with $344 million for the third quarter of 2010.  Fourth quarter revenue details were as follows. Fourth quarter Instrument and Accessory revenue was $151 million, up 33% compared with $113 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 19% compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase relative to the fourth quarter of 2009 is primarily driven by procedure growth of 35% year-over-year. The increase relative to the third quarter is primarily driven by procedure growth, as well as an increase in the amount of stocking orders and customer purchases of our new 8.5 millimeters scopes.  Instrument and Accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,940 per procedure, which is lower than the fourth quarter of 2009 by approximately $20 and higher than the third quarter of 2010 by approximately $100. The changes in the instrument and accessory revenue per procedure primarily reflect changes in and the impact of stocking orders. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base. Fourth quarter 2010 Systems revenue of $178 million increased 10%, compared with $162 million of Systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 and increased 11% compared with $160 million of Systems revenue for the third quarter. Recently, we began delivering new Si Systems for customers' S Systems versus completing as S to Si field upgrade. In addition, the contract terms and economics for these Si for S trade-ins are now reflective of Si sales. Accordingly, we have begun including S to Si upgrades in our systems counts.  Inclusive of nine S to Si trade-ins, we sold 124 systems in the fourth quarter of 2010. This compares to 110 systems in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 105 systems in the third quarter of 2010. I would note that the prior-period system counts exclude 10 S to Si upgrades for both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2010.  Our fourth quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models and S to Si trade-ins but excluding upgrades, was $1.41 million equal to the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a decrease from the $1.43 million realized in the third quarter. The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior quarter is primarily the result of mix of products including a reduction in the proportion of Si Dual Consoles sold in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by an increase due to a greater number of systems sold to direct customers in Europe.  Service revenue increased to $61 million, up 27% compared with $48 million last year and up 6% compared with $57 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base and an increase in the mix of Si, which carry a higher annual service fee.  Total fourth quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $212 million, up 31% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 15% compared with the third quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represent 54% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 50% in the fourth quarter last year and 54% last quarter.  Non-U.S. revenue represented 25% of our total revenue in the quarter, compared with 22% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 17% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2010. Non-U.S. procedures grew 42% on a year-to-year basis in a seasonally stronger quarter. dVP in Europe was the greatest driver in non-U.S. procedure growth, although we experienced growth in all procedure categories.  Instrument and accessory revenue grew at a rate similar to the procedure growth. We sold 38 systems outside the U.S. including two S to Si trade-ins, compared with 30 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 22 last quarter. I would note that there was one S to Si upgrade outside the U.S. in both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2010.  Despite uncertainties surrounding European economies, we sold 28 systems in Europe this quarter, compared to 16 in the third quarter and 21 last year. Aleks will provide additional details of overseas system sales.  Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 73%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 gross margin of 72% and compared with the third quarter of 2010 gross margin of 73%. The increase over the prior year reflects lower manufacturing costs and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base.  Fourth quarter 2010 operating expenses of $128 million were up 23% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 8% compared with the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter and increased R&D prototype spending. We added 92 employees in the quarter, including 54 employees in the sales and service organization as we continue to expand our clinical sales force and 28 employees in operations. Fourth quarter 2010 operating income was $154 million or 40% of sales, compared with $128 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter 2009 and $132 million or 38% of sales for the third quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter 2010 operating income reflected $30 million of noncash stock compensation expense compared with $25 million for the fourth quarter 2009 and $30 million last quarter. The year-over-year growth in noncash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of this year.  Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 23% brought our annual tax rate to 33% compared to our 2009 rate of 41%. The reduction in rates between years reflects the implementation of our international tax structure and a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S. Our fourth quarter rate benefited from a greater portion of our income being generated outside the U.S., from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D credit and from a reduction in nondeductible stock option expenses. Our net income was $121 million or $3.02 per share, compared with $78 million or $1.95 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $87 million or $2.14 per share for the third quarter of 2010.  Let me quickly summarize our results for 2010. Procedures grew by 35% to approximately 278,000. Total revenue for 2010 was $1.413 billion, up 34% compared with $1.052 billion last year. This included recurring revenue growth of 34% and an increase in Systems revenue of 35%. Operating income for 2010 was $555 million, up 47% compared with $377 million last year. Operating income included $118 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2010 compared with $97 million in 2009. Net income for 2010 was $382 million or $9.47 per share, compared with $233 million or $5.93 per share last year. Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended 2010 with cash and investments of $1.609 billion, down $12 million compared with September 30, 2010. The decrease during the quarter reflects $125 million of cash flows from operations, plus $8 million from the exercise of stock options, more than offset by $140 million of stock buybacks and $9 million of capital and IT purchases.  During the fourth quarter, we bought back 530,000 shares at an average price of $2.64 per share, bringing our total repurchases for the year to 742,000 shares at an average price of $2.68 per share. As of December 31, there was $101 million of the board authorized buybacks remain.  Our accounts receivable balance increased to $247 million at December 31, from $208 million at September 30, reflecting increased revenue. Our net inventory increased to $87 million at December 31 from $85 million at September 30. The increase reflects inventory necessary to support increased revenues.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the fourth quarter, we sold 124 da Vinci Systems: 86 in the United States, 28 in Europe and 10 into rest of world markets. As part of the 124 System sales, 24 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems, and nine S Systems were traded in for Si Systems.  We had a net 91 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,752, the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide: 1,285 in the U.S., 316 in Europe and 151 in rest of world markets. 50 of the 124 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. The 38 system sales internationally was our strongest quarter-to-date and included six da Vinci Systems into Italy, five into Germany and three into the countries of France and Korea.  Clinically, we had a strong quarter, with GYN and more specifically, benign dVH contributing the greatest absolute growth. While dVH for malignant conditions showed very good sequential growth, benign dVH growth was stronger both in actual procedure growth and in percentage growth. Additionally, overall benign GYN procedures, which included sacrocolpopexy, myomectomy and endometrial resections, also exhibited strong sequential growth. Within the segment of urology, dVP, Partial Nephrectomy and Cystectomy were all up materially on a sequential basis. And finally, head and neck, colorectal and thoracic resections all displayed strong sequential growth.  Our strong fourth quarter procedure growth was not limited to a specific geography. It was global in structure. On a year-over-year comparison, overall fourth quarter procedures grew by approximately 35%, which is consistent with our overall 2010 procedure growth as well as our 2010 procedure guidance.  On a global basis, we finished 2010 having completed approximately 278,000 total procedures led by dVH, representing approximately 110,000 and dVP, representing approximately 98,000. Benign GYN procedures have become a significant catalyst for growth within our overall business. dVH, da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy, Myomectomy and endometrial resections represent large business opportunities, both U.S. and internationally. And the peer-reviewed data supporting da Vinci's role within these procedures is beginning to expand.  A rapidly emerging benign GYN procedure, one we have not talked a great deal about is da Vinci Myomectomy. Myomectomy is a procedure to remove a uterine fibroid while preserving a patient's uterus. Currently, the gold standard operation for myomectomy includes a lower abdominal incision. Over the past few years, traditional laparoscopic myomectomies have been performed more regularly. However, due to the extensive suturing required for adequate closure, it is considered technically difficult and therefore, limited in its clinical adoption.  At the American Society of Reproductive Medicine Conference, a paper entitled 'Robotic-Assisted, Laparoscopic, and Open Myomectomy: A Comparison of Surgical Outcomes' was presented. The study was authored by a group of physicians representing the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Case Western Reserve University.  The study examined blood loss, length of stay and operating time for 575 patients within these three distinct cohorts. The three groups were case matched with comparable myomas regarding size, number and location and adjusted for age and body mass index. When comparing da Vinci Myomectomy to open myomectomy, average surgical time did increase. But average blood loss was reduced significantly by 50%, and the average hospitalization was reduced from three days to one day. When comparing da Vinci Myomectomy to traditional laparoscopy, surgical time was reduced by an average of 22 minutes and blood loss was reduced by an average of 33%.  In their conclusion, the authors wrote, and I quote, "robotic-assisted myomectomy is associated with decreased estimated blood loss and length of hospital stay compared to traditional laparoscopy and open myomectomy. Despite that robotic use is associated with longer OR time compared to open procedures, it is shorter than laparoscopic approach. It appears that robotic technology is able to convert more laparotomy cases." Total GYN procedures represent nearly half of our overall procedure volume, with the overwhelming majority being comprised of procedures to treat benign conditions. We are pleased by the fact that our customers and patients are experiencing an enhanced clinical value within these large mainstream procedure categories.  However, we do recognize that it makes procedure volumes more susceptible to general seasonality and macroeconomic pressures. This is due in large part to a patient's ability to postpone some treatments to a future date when it becomes more economically convenient for them.  On the other end of the spectrum, we have experienced strong growth trajectories within the category that I will term very complex procedures, procedures where volumes are less seasonally affected, namely, head and neck surgery, colon and rectal surgery, renal cancer, cervical and endometrial cancer and lung cancer procedures. While some of these procedure categories are potentially large with steep growth trajectories, they are also fairly young with respect to their adoption. And therefore, individually, their contribution is currently less impactful to our overall procedure number.  The fastest growing segment in 2010 was head and neck surgery. The category more than tripled in size during the year and showed exceptional sequential growth in Q4. We are seeing more and more peer-reviewed literature describing da Vinci's role within this category.  In a recent edition of the journal Oncology, three surgeons from the Department of Head and Neck Surgery at the University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center authored a comprehensive perspective paper entitled 'A Shifting Paradigm for Patients with Head and Neck Cancer: Transoral Robotic Surgery' or TORS.  The paper reviewed the functional outcomes from various studies published by leading head and neck cancer centers such as the Mayo Clinic Rochester, University of Pennsylvania, the University of Alabama Birmingham and MD Anderson. The authors highlighted the initial study out of Penn, which reported that 25 out of their first 27 patients undergoing a da Vinci procedure for tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma attained negative margins, and the two patients with positive margins were later cleared. Local control was achieved in all 27 at six months' follow up.  Next, the University of Alabama Birmingham evaluated 54 patients undergoing TORS and found that only five required a temporary tracheostomy with decannulation or removal occurring at a mean of eight days. Similar functional data was reported in a series by Moore, et al. at the Mayo Clinic. His group reported an average time to decannulation of seven days. This is a significant improvement for decannulation over conventional surgery, where it is usually reported in weeks or months rather than days.  These early evaluations of oncologic and functional outcomes of TORS illustrate a minimally invasive technique that permits resection of a tumor en bloc while preserving patient swallowing ability. The MD Anderson group concluded their paper by stating, and I quote, "robotic surgery in head and neck oncology is an exciting innovation that provides significant advantages. Patients have an en bloc removal of their tumors via a minimally invasive surgery without a cervical incision, while preserving function and potentially avoiding adjuvant radiation and its long-term sequelae. While long-term oncologic functional data are needed to fully validate its use, early results are promising."  That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the time over to Calvin.
Calvin Darling: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing you with our financial forecast for 2011, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates of significant noncash expenses to provide you with visibility into our expected future cash flows.  Starting with procedures. We continue to see strong growth in da Vinci hysterectomies in the U.S., dVPs in Europe and general growth across a broadening range of procedures at earlier stages of market adoption. We expect our 2011 total procedures to grow between 25% and 28% from a base of approximately 278,000 procedures performed in 2010. Based on an increasing percentage of benign hysterectomies and other short-term elective procedures in our procedure mix, we anticipate a more pronounced quarterly seasonality impact in 2011 as compared to 2010.  Moving to revenues. We expect to achieve annual revenue growth of between 16% and 20%. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as system placements may vary. We expect typical capital sales seasonality in 2011, with Q1 being a relatively lighter quarter and Q4 being the seasonally strongest.  With regards to gross margin, we reported fourth quarter 2010 gross profit of 72.5% of sales. Looking forward into 2011, we anticipate maintaining our margins near the current level at a rate of between 72% and 73% of sales for the year. Gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to product and geographical mix.  Moving to operating expense. We expect our GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 16% to 20% in 2011, which is in line with our expected top line growth. Our 2011 operating expense growth will be driven by clinical sales resource additions in the field to support newly installed systems and drive procedure growth. Investments in new and existing R&D projects to drive growth in our long-term business, and noncash stock compensation expense growth of approximately 22%.  We expect our noncash stock compensation charges to increase from $118 million recorded in 2010 to approximately $140 million to $145 million in 2011. Amortization of purchased intellectual property, which is mostly recorded as R&D expense, is expected to increase from $16 million in 2010 to $17 million to $20 million in 2011.  Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, has been decreasing due to lower interest rates earned on our cash investments. We expect other income to come in between $17 million and $18 million in 2011, which is down slightly from approximately $19 million earned in 2010.  With regard to income tax. In 2010, we reported income taxes at a rate of 33.3% of pretax income. As some of the items that benefited 2010 will not carry forward, we anticipate recording 2011 income taxes at about 34% of pretax income. We estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 2011 will be approximately 40.3 million shares.  Cash. Our cash balance has remained in the $1.6 billion range throughout the second half of 2010 as we have largely returned operating cash flows to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases, including $140 million used to repurchase shares in Q4. Our repurchase program remains active, and entering Q1 2011, we have approximately $101 million remaining authorized by the board to buyback additional shares. We will communicate any future repurchase authorizations as they become effective.  That concludes my comments. Now I'll open the floor for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Maybe start talking about the kind of change in your outlook for procedure growth, and you did go through quite of few of the factors. But 35% performance in the quarter for the full year in '10, and you're guiding 25% to 28% for next year. Would you characterize that as conservative? Is that something that as you've added so many sales reps, you're waiting to see if that productivity is coming through and there's a fair bit of upside to that? Or what led to that guidance?
Gary Guthart: Yes, Ben. Before we jump in and answer the questions, just one correction on the call.
Marshall Mohr: Yes, in I guess my script, I mentioned that we had bought back shares and I gave prices of $2.64 to $2.68. Obviously, that wasn't the price. I missed it by a couple of digits. It's $264 and $268.
Gary Guthart: Anyway, to the question on kind of what's underlying the growth in the growth guidance. The major drivers of growth looking forward will be a continued adoption of gynecology in the U.S. In the U.S., the malignant side of hysterectomy, so hysterectomy for cancer conditions are going to the upper part of the curve and really the growth will be coming out of benign hysterectomy. Benign hysterectomy is diffused, so it's a little bit harder to consolidate. That's one. A second source of growth in the procedure domain will be urology in Europe, which is coming along nicely but a little lower on the curve. And then emerging procedures, while they were growing really nicely, they're at a little bit smaller base. So a little bit of it is just the timing of these different adoptions as they progress.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Is it reasonable, Gary, to think as you go through the year that in fact it could be accelerating as some of those curves are moving further out and higher to the top right? Because again, you're just kind of at the front edge of many of the new emerging procedure codes you've been discussing.
Gary Guthart: I think we'll have to see where the emerging procedures go as they come up. I think we call them emerging because they're promising, and they're going quickly but on small basis. And really, the challenge and the question for us is how quickly can they move up. And I think we're just going to have to report on it as the year progresses.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: And last question for me is the hiring plans for the field organization. You've been increasing that quite steadily over the course of '10. How would you think about the quarters progressing over the course of '11?
Gary Guthart: Yes, we kind of felt like 2010 was a catch-up year for some slow hiring in 2009. And I think we've done a pretty good job of catching up and getting close. We'll continue to hire, but I think the rate of hire will start to temper a little bit as we move into the back part of '11. I'll let Jerry add little color to that.
Jerome McNamara: Yes, I think that, as Gary mentioned, we caught up. We're just about where we want to be. We do use pretty careful metrics to add sales force accordingly as the procedures grow. And I think that we'll be in the sweet spot in the next quarter or two, and then we'll manage it as procedure growth dictates.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: On the Q from last quarter, you talked about the new Si-e model. And this looks, I guess, more kind of a de-featured system. Can you just talk about the opportunity there and how we think about maybe that blending into ASPs? Is there some risk, I guess, you move down the ASP curve as you push this out?
Gary Guthart: We think there is an opportunity, kind of an economic opportunity there for the Si-e. It is a de-featured version of the Si. It has a lot of the feature-forward compatibility that the Si line has. And we think that as we move into more benign procedures -- and frankly, head and neck is fundamentally a three-hour procedure -- that there is an opportunity there both for customers who are little more price sensitive as well as second system sales that go into sites that are having more diverse procedure lines. So that's kind of the frame up of the Si-e.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Can you, I guess, just comment on what the ASP is, and did that impact this quarter at all yet? You talked about fewer Dual Consoles as this impacting ASPs?
Gary Guthart: Yes, I'll let Marshall talk about that.
Marshall Mohr: So the list price for an Si-e is below that of an Si, obviously, because it's de-featured. I believe it's $1.3 million.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Second question on colorectal. You called that out obviously as one of the emerging growth areas. How do we think about -- you talked about the stapler obviously in process here. How do we think about it, maybe how much pent-up demand there is post the stapler coming out? I mean, you've, again, seen some nice traction before it's been launched. But how do we think about how important getting the stapler out will be to really driving uptake of colorectal?
Aleks Cukic: Yes. It's really hard to say at this stage, Tycho. I think we'll know when we get there. But what we've learned in the past is often one or two instruments can make a great deal of difference in optimizing a procedure. We saw it in prostatectomy with bipolar energy and the appropriate grasper to manage the tumor or the prostate, I should say. And you start to see procedure times come down, and you start to see case reports improving and so on and so forth. So we know the process of trying to optimize a procedure. And I think stapling becomes directionally a pretty important product, not just in colorectal, but perhaps in lung surgery and some of the other large sort of very complex procedures. So in terms of pent-up demand, I don't know that we even know how to call that. I would just say that it's a product launch, or I should say, a product development that should add value in a number of targets for us going forward.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And can you provide any more color on timing? I mean, should we think about that this year or...
Aleks Cukic: Well, I think the way you want to think about it, we've talked about products that are either in FDA or in development. This one is still in the development phase, which means it's not in front of the FDA. The pace of development and the quality of the prototyping is excellent, but it's a very complex procedure, there's no question about it. So there's really not a lot more we probably will go into other than just think of it in development at this stage.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then just one last one on prostate. As we think about where we are in the adoption curve, obviously more of a focus here on hysterectomy in the U.S. and some of these emerging procedures. But is your view that dVP can stay kind of flat in 2011 in the U.S? Or is there a risk, I guess, that could go negative as we think about?
Aleks Cukic: There's always risk. But I would say that if you looked at it in 2010, it was actually up in the United States. Not materially so, but we've described it pretty much each quarter as flattish and it's actually up a little bit in the United States. The majority of the growth came from outside. Almost overwhelming amount of the growth came from outside the United States, which we believe will be the case. I think there will be a sort of a give-and-take between other therapies that go on with prostatectomy indefinitely, I think. We are picking up some procedures that may have been sort of headed toward radiation or other therapies, and they will probably pick up a case that was headed for surgery. So we think of it as flattish in the near term, and that's probably as accurate as we can be.
Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Actually, just one last one on Japan. Can you comment on whether you placed any systems there, and anything new to highlight?
Aleks Cukic: I think we placed one system in Japan. And as far as anything new to highlight, we continue to work, as we've talked about in the past, with various stakeholders in Japan about looking at ways to get reimbursement approved on a global basis, if you will, as opposed to a manual basis. It isn't anything that we are expecting for 2011. I think through 2011, we'll continue to move the process on a manual basis. And yes, we'd expect some systems to be sold, but we are not at a point where we would classify it as fully optimized and nor would we expect it in 2011.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
James Francescone: This is actually James in for David. First question on the international business. I mean, obviously, very strong results overseas this quarter, kind of been hovering between 20 and 30 boxes for the past maybe even two or three years and 38 this quarter. Any insight into what's changing those markets? Is that kind of macro recovery theme, or is that a better execution on your end?
Jerome McNamara: We can't control any of the macro conditions over in Europe, but we can control our execution on development of our procedure business. And I think we had a pretty good year. As we moved through the year, we also caught up on our headcount and expanded our sales force. And at the end of the year our dVP number started to grow in all affected countries, and our penetration and growth is getting to a critical point where it's impacting the demand for additional systems. So by focusing on the procedure, the capital systems continue to come. So we expect to just continue to drive the procedures and there will be seasonality in Europe just as there has been over the years, but we did see a pretty good uptick at the end of the year.
Aleks Cukic: One of the things we've said in the past is we knew there would be a stagger between dVP outside the United States compared to dVP in the U.S., and that is structural. We believe there is a lag. There will be a lag in GYN. There will be a lag in other procedures. So what you saw in 2010 was really a nice uptick in the dVP business, specifically in Europe. Overall European numbers were up about 48%. And you started to see, let's say -- I don't want to oversell and say some critical mass, but you saw some strength, early strength in gynecologic cancer operation, dVH malignant, which is what we would have expected because we've got sort of a history, if you will, of starting in the most complex areas, showing value and then moving on beyond that. And I think it's starting to feel like we're getting some traction in various European countries. So that I would say en bloc is really the difference in European 2010 business.
James Francescone: As you characterize this more as just a strong quarter or do you think you're reaching more of an inflection point there?
Gary Guthart: I think with hearing both those answers is that we're starting to see some nice procedure momentum. And I think over time, the capital side maybe lumpy, and I'd expect it to continue to be lumpy. But as long as we can keep driving the procedure business up the curve the way we think we can, ultimately, I think it will pull systems.
James Francescone: And then on Single Site. Last quarter, you sounded a little bit cautious for launch timing, but it seems like you made a lot of progress in the 4Q. Any more firm commitment as to when we can expect to see the launch there?
Gary Guthart: We're still in conversation with the regulatory bodies. I think we're in the question-and-answer period, and we understand the questions and they have answers. And I can't tell you exactly when that process will conclude, but just that we're working through it.
James Francescone: And one last one on buybacks. Given the cash accumulation over the past year, have you started to consider something that's a more substantial buyback program as opposed to primarily opportunistic? Or just more broadly, how are you thinking about capital deployment going forward?
Marshall Mohr: You know the numbers. I mean, we bought back 742,000 shares at $268 per share for the year. We do think about ways to return capital to shareholders, and we still have another $101 million authorized and it's up to the board to decide whether or not we proceed with a greater program.
Gary Guthart: Directionally, we've been happy with the buybacks. We think it's been a good mechanism for us, and we'll look for opportunities when the time is right to continue that pathway.
Operator: We'll go to the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: In your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about an increasing number of procedures being exposed to some of the cyclicality we've seen elsewhere in healthcare. But if you look at this, it's pretty significant acceleration in procedure growth in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe help us characterize or maybe parse out what part of that acceleration do you think came from the rebound of some of those procedures that might have been deferred versus an acceleration in some of the underlying and sort of the more legacy procedures like dVH associated with new sales force hires?
Aleks Cukic: It's really difficult to tease it out exactly. But what I can tell you directionally is even -- in the fourth quarter, for example, in the United States, we saw a nice increase in dVP. So we also saw a nice increase in the GYN procedures both U.S. and o U.S. Looking at it and some of that was directionally driven by new hires and new commitments, if you will, to the field organization. So it's hard to say how much of that is pent-up, how much of that is driven because of seasonality. What we do know and what we learned last year really for the first time in, let's say, Q1, the issue of fully paid deductibles versus unpaid deductibles had an impact on some of the more elective procedures. And so that is something we'll call out as that becomes a bigger part of our business.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Switching over to P&L. You talked obviously about adding some sales reps and expanding your selling organization. If we look at SG&A over the course of 2010, it grew slower than revenue in the first half of the year and then accelerated to slightly faster than revenue in the back half of the year. And you're guiding just sort of OpEx growth in line with top line growth for next year, sorry, for 2011. So is essentially most of that build-out complete with respect to the selling organization, or are there any sort of significant investments that we should look for over the course of 2011? And if we look at the boxing and on the pacing of the year, should we start to see more leverage as we get to the second half on the SG&A line?
Gary Guthart: I'll answer the first two subparts, and I'll have Marshall answer the last one. I think on the sales side, you ought to think of it in rates. We accelerated the rate of sales hiring in '10. We'll continue to hire into the sales force in '11, but the rate of hire we'll temper a little bit. And so a couple of things happened. One is we did some sales hiring throughout the year, but we do a little bit more in Q4 in anticipation of the beginning part of the year of 2011 to get them on board and effective sooner into the year rather than later. So you see a little bit of that surge. The other thing that happened is, as Marshall mentioned in the script, we had some timing of R&D prototype expenses that shifted around in the back half of the year, and that's just lumpy. The nature of R&D expense can be lumpy. So on those two sides, I think that we'll see a little tempering of headcount hiring in 2011 in terms of a rate, continued investments in R&D. And in terms of front and back half of 2011, I'll turn that to Marshall.
Marshall Mohr: We typically have a little bit -- when you look at ratio to revenue, because of seasonality in the quarters, you typically will see a higher rate of expenditure relative to revenue in Q1 and a slightly higher rate in Q3 as well, and then the other two quarters look better. But it really has to do with seasonality of revenue.
Aleks Cukic: Right. A kind of linear growth as it relates to the operating expenses.
David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then lastly, on the tax rate, the 34% number for 2011. I'm assuming that does not include an assumption on the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit but is more a reflection of a structural move down on your tax rate, which we should expect to continue over time?
Marshall Mohr: It's actually reflective of both. The reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, it was reinstated through 2011. So we will get an R&D tax credit in 2011. Having said that, the bigger impact in 2010, and overall the bigger impact is the change in the mix of revenue on a global basis. So as you earn more money overseas, you're being taxed a lower rate and that brings your tax rate down. So 34% is reflective of what we think the mix will be next year.
Operator: Go to the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.
Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC: First, a bigger picture and maybe, Gary, I'll just ask you. I mean, clearly, you had a really strong fourth quarter. Maybe you could comment or reflect on to what extent do we attribute the fourth quarter strength that's specific to Intuitive as opposed to possibly reflecting sort of more optimism on the hospital side or capital spending, that sort of environmental stabilizing to improving versus your own excellent business trends?
Gary Guthart: It's a good question. It's a hard one to answer. I guess, I'll just speak directionally. I think the piece we feel good about on is really on the procedure side. I think procedure growth there is, I think the mix of both excellent execution by the sales force, strong patient value and the procedures that we offer and a little bit of seasonality in terms of patients' willingness and access to care into Q4. I think you saw some of all three of those things. I think on the capital side, I think it feels in the middle to us. I don't think we feel like there's a strong environmental trend one way or the other, broadly speaking. And so when we think about the capital business, we think it's driven by a few things. We think it's driven, first, by procedures and capacity, by access to capital, of course, and by the availability of new products and the desirability of those products. So just to come back to the original question, the biggest thing we feel good about, I think, is that demand for da Vinci procedures seem pretty strong and we were able to go out and service that demand.
Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC: And if I could, and maybe, Aleks, this is directed to you. But obviously, another solid quarter of da Vinci placements. But can you comment on why the trade-ins seemed unusually high? Couple of aspects to this question. Just that extraordinarily high number, is there any particular reason? Maybe give us a little color if you can on how much more upgrades there are to go at this point. Another question. Just as I look at our model and look at the -- if I'm looking at it correctly, the net new adds have sort of been 87 to now 91 net new adds for the last five quarters now, so about 360 annualized run rate. Should we think about net placements going forward? Is that the right annual rate going forward, or will we see net adds actually increase in 2011 or 2012? How do we think about that trend?
Aleks Cukic: I think there are a couple of questions in there, so I'll give you a numerical answer to one of them, and I believe you asked how many more systems can be upgraded. And I believe the number, for example, in the United States pertaining to Standard systems is 162 or so, somewhere thereabout. Let's call it 150, north of 150 slightly. And outside the United States, it is probably not all that dissimilar to that number. Now it doesn't mean that all of them are going to come back in time. I think we've got a fairly predictable trend over -- if you were just to plot it out over the last several quarters. It will be up, down, but I don't think there's anything material in the way we're behaving that would suggest that it's going to increase or decrease at a rapid rate quickly. So the answer really becomes, what does the customer want to do when we will work with the customer. We're doing this as a customer accommodation. We're giving them value back for a product that they paid for and used and now want a more advanced product. And we'll continue to be focused on the customers' needs. In terms of a go-forward projection, Rick, it's really hard to say. Eventually, you're going to get into your modeling, and I can't recall if you're actually modeling units. But if you do, I think you've got some data points that suggest kind of directionally where the trade-ins are going. So I don't know that there's a lot more color I can give you on that.
Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC: And just to draw from this, the business about, your running about a 360 unit net add in the last four quarters. Are we going to see absolute units grow net of trade-ins from here? I mean, is that the way to think it as we look out over the next two, three, four years? Or will net adds on an annual basis continue to grow, do you think?
Aleks Cukic: Again, Rick, I think if you look at it, you take the most recent data point, you have 50 of the 124 systems went to existing owners, which means that 74 went to new owners. So that's a pretty large number. So I think it's suggestive of the fact that there's a lot of new owners that are out there that will be buying for the first time. In terms of how the ratios might fall out, I'm not sure. But I would say that, yes, we're planning to sell systems.
Gary Guthart: Another way to look at it, Rick, really is you're talking about net adds to the installed base. That's going to drive that up or down. It all comes back to procedure adoption in the end and how big your installed base needs to be serve the number of procedures that you're going to do.
Marshall Mohr: Procedure adoption and utilization.
Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC: You all understandably never talk in depth about the product pipeline. Should we expect -- should we think that there might be some major new systems introduced this year as opposed to some other year versus the constant steady flow of procedure-specific incremental instruments? Could this be a year where we see something more dramatic?
Aleks Cukic: I would say this, Rick. I think the products that we've been coloring up now for a few quarters, by our definition, are big products. They're not easy products, when we talk about Single Site, when we talk about stapling, when we talk about a cut and seal or ligation systems. These are not insignificant developments. So by any definition, I think they are considered big deals. But again, that's not to promise any timelines or anything else. It's just to say directionally, we're focusing on some pretty complex stuff.
Operator: And that would come from Amit Hazan with Gleacher.
Amit Hazan - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Just the first one, just to kind of circle back on your procedure guidance. I think as we think about your performance in past years, there's been a really good correlation between the growth in the installed base and then the growth in procedures you end up putting up. Growth in the installed base has been about 26% in the last 12 months, and your guidance for procedure growth is now 25% to 28%. And obviously, you get some utilization improvement every year as well. So I'm trying to understand if I'm missing something or thinking about it the right way, but you're being conservative. But just in thinking about that, the relationship between unit placements and the growth that we're going to see in procedures, what else we should be considering maybe in terms of utilization or other to get to your guidance?
Marshall Mohr: Utilization continues to increase slowly year-to-year. And the relationship between them, procedure growth and systems growth, it's really hard to correlate those in a small time frame just because the capital purchasing cycle is unpredictable. On a long-term basis that they should be closer or match up better as procedures do drive system sales.
Gary Guthart: Just to color that up a little bit. I think that if you can integrate over a many year period, the number of procedures you do will tell you how many systems you need to do that number of procedures. A couple of things that are interesting. Greenfields have a lag effect to bring those programs up to full capability. And then the one that's really hard to model is as robotic programs become multi-specialty, how many procedures they can get on a system while sharing it across multi-specialty is highly variable. And so as these emerging procedures come on, utilization trends start to move around a little bit. And so it's a very tough thing to model. I think that was our last question. Thank you. As we've discussed with you over the years, while we spend time on these calls reviewing our financial performance, our teams remain sharply focused on the creation of patient value, improving the efficacy of surgery while reducing its invasiveness. I would like to share with you two brief examples of what this means in the lives of our patients.  The first patient is Sandra, who had her da Vinci procedure in Miami. Sandra reports, "on November 29, 2010, I received a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung. I have always been an extremely healthy person and a nonsmoker, so you can imagine how shocking this diagnosis was for me. Being a nurse practitioner and a former OR nurse, I thought I knew what I was in for.  I have a friend who underwent a traditional lobectomy for the same diagnosis ten years previously. She spent two weeks in the hospital, five days in the ICU and was subjected to a broken rib and scapula in order to provide access to the lung. It was three months before she was able to return to work, and she still has pain to this day.  Fortunately, I was wrong. I have a friend who works for Intuitive Surgical. He was adamant that I meet with Dr. Mark Dylewski at South Miami Hospital. I did my research and learned that Dr. Dylewski is very experienced with the da Vinci robot, having done over 300 robotic-assisted surgeries. I met Dr. Dylewski on November 30, and knew immediately that he was my surgeon. His confidence was just the reassurance that I needed.  On December 9, I was admitted to South Miami Hospital for robotic-assisted right lower lobectomy. My surgery took an hour and a half. I had minimal postoperative pain and was up and walking the next day. I was discharged to home on day two and stopped pain medication on day six. I returned to work two weeks after surgery and was back to the gym for a light workout three weeks after surgery. I have to say I feel blessed. My tumor was found early. My nodes are negative, and I have an excellent prognosis. I am blessed to have caring friends. I'm blessed to have found this brilliant surgeon. I am blessed that this amazing technology is available.  I would encourage anyone who receives a diagnosis of lung cancer to find a surgeon and a hospital that offers the da Vinci robotic surgery. It saved me from agonizing postoperative pain and a long debilitating recovery. I traveled 125 miles south to Miami, and I am so glad that I did it." Our second patient is Linda, who had sacrocolpopexy completed in Reno, Nevada. She says, "I had a hysterectomy 30 years ago. So when I was told I needed a sacrocolpopexy, all I can think about was the pain and long recovery. Needless to say, I was dreading this procedure.  Dr. Macaskill [ph] assured to me that the da Vinci procedure would be less invasive, less painful and I would feel better in less time. Thanks to this very talented surgeon and the da Vinci robot, the procedure and the recovery have exceeded all of my expectations. There was really no pain, only discomfort around one of the five incisions. I felt the need to use pain medication for the first three days. And after that, Aleve worked great at night to help me sleep.  I was up and about shortly after the surgery and was totally amazed by the fact that I could stand up straight and walk without any pain or feeling like my stitches were pulling apart. I had to remind myself before overdoing things that I just had major surgery.  Wow, what a difference between the surgery I had 30 years ago, when I was unable to stand up straight and barely able to shuffle around for the first couple of weeks than the one I just experienced with the da Vinci robot. Anyone who has the option to have this da Vinci procedure should take advantage of it. Compared to the other options, it is truly amazing." Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.  This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in three months time.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes your call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.

Ben Gong: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical’s first quarter conference call. With me today we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our Web site, at intuitivesurgical.com, on the Audio Archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today’s press release has been posted to our Web site. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter’s business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, and I will provide an update to our financial forecast for 2010, and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thank you for joining us today. In this first quarter, our team has executed well. We continue to see broad interest in da Vinci surgery by our customers across a variety of procedures, which is reflected in our strong financial results for the quarter. With regard to procedures, we experienced continued growth in numerous specialties. Urologic and gynecologic procedures continue to lead the way and we see early signs of growth in both general and colorectal surgery and thoracic procedures. We are also pleased that European procedure growth was strong in the quarter. While the diversity of procedures is encouraging, it presents both opportunities and sales management challenges. The breadth of procedures is commanding increased investments in our sales force and is reflected in our recent hiring. Turning to systems, U.S. sales were robust. We did, however, see an increasing pressure on hospital capital budgets in Europe where capital sales conversations mirrored those in the U.S. during the first half of last year. Lastly, we sold our first systems in Japan this quarter post our Shonin approval. We’ll discuss Japan in greater detail later in the call. As we move to highlights for the first quarter, recall that Q1 2009 financials included a revenue deferral associated with the introduction of the da Vinci Si System. In my year-over-year comparisons, I will compare financial performance excluding the deferral to give a more accurate picture of relative performance. With that as a background, operating highlights for the first quarter are as follows. Procedures grew 37% over the first quarter of 2009. We sold 104 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up 38 from 66 during the first quarter of last year. Total revenue was $329 million, up 58% over the last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $123 million, up 50% over the year. Total recurring revenue grew to $173 million, up 43% from prior year and comprising 53% of total revenue. Net income was $85 million, up 112% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $157 million before non-cash stock option expenses, up 78% from the first quarter of last year and representing 48% of Q1 revenue. With operating profit percentage at this level, we do not expect to pursue further margin expansion. We will continue to share productivity gains with our customers and we will continue to invest in R&D and long-term growth opportunities for the business. We ended the quarter with $1.396 billion in cash and investments, up $224 million from last quarter and up $574 million from last year. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $16 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets. Excluding the impact of these outlays as well as $93 million from stock proceeds and $6 million used for working capital, we generated $153 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 180% of our reported GAAP net income in the first quarter. I share this number with you because we believe that it is the best measure of the economic horsepower of our company. As you know, we continue to make significant investments in research, development and manufacturing. Our largest investments focus on four areas. First, we are extending our instrument offering through major additions, like multifunction energy devices and robotic stapling. Second, we are improving and expanding our imaging capabilities. Third, we’re developing new patient side mechanisms. And finally, we are creating surgical networking and training technologies. Overall, we’re pleased with the progress of our product development teams and our technology partners both in the depth of their achievements and in the speed with which they are accomplishing them. Lastly, as we enter new surgical markets and drive them to new product arenas, we will invest in building our team and expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that could make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter we added 94 people to our team predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,357 employees. And with that, I’ll pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our first quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. Last year we offered certain first quarter 2009 customers the opportunity to upgrade their da Vinci S Systems to da Vinci Si Systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessories in exchange for da Vinci Si accessories. As a result, we deferred a total of $20 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2009, comprised of $18 million of system revenue associated with system upgrade offers and $2 million of accessory revenue. We recognized $14 million of the total $20 million deferral in our second quarter of 2009 and the remaining $6 million in the third quarter of 2009. I will now walk you through our revenue results with comparisons to the first quarter of 2009 as though the deferral had not occurred. Our first quarter revenue was $329 million, up 58% compared with $209 million for the first quarter of 2009 and up 2% compared with $323 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. First quarter revenues by product category were as follows. First quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $123 million, up 50% compared with $82 million for the first quarter of 2009 and up 8% compared with $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase compared with prior quarters reflects procedure growth and higher initial stocking orders. The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,970 per procedure, which is approximately $170 higher than the first quarter of 2009 and approximately the same as the fourth quarter. The year-to-year increase primarily reflects higher stocking orders in the current quarter in customer buying patterns as we believe that customers reduced inventory levels in the first quarter of 2009 in the face of a deteriorating economic environment. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger installed base. First quarter 2010 systems revenue of $155 million increased 77% compared with $88 million of systems revenue for the first quarter of 2009 and decreased 4% compared with $162 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter. We sold 104 systems in the first quarter of 2010 compared with 66 systems last year and 110 systems last quarter. 80 of the 104 or 77% of the units sold in the quarter were da Vinci Si systems. There were 17 da Vinci Standard systems traded in this quarter compared to six in the first quarter of 2009 and 23 last quarters. First quarter system revenue also included $5 million of upgrade revenue compared to none in the first quarter of 2009 and $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our first quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades in the revenue deferral, was $1.45 million, an increase from $1.33 million realized in the first quarter of 2009 and an increase from the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter. The increase compared to the prior year reflects the introduction of the Si product, which has a higher price point than the S. The increase compared to the fourth quarter reflects favorable customer and product mix. We expect ASPs over the next several quarters to return to historical levels. Service revenue increased to $51 million, up 29% compared with $39 million last year and up 6% compared with $48 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was driven by a larger system installed base. Total first quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to $173 million, up 43% compared with the first quarter of 2009 and up 8% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Recurring revenue represented 53% of total first quarter revenue compared with 58% in the first quarter last year and 50% last quarter. Revenue by geography was as follows. Non-U.S. revenue represented 21% of our total revenue in the quarter compared with 25% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2009 and 22% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009. Overall, procedures grew faster outside of the U.S. We sold 24 systems outside the U.S. compared with 22 in the first quarter of 2009 and 30 last quarters. Seven of the systems sold in the first quarter were to early thought leaders in Japan. We would remind you, however, that adoption in Japan is expected to proceed slowly, and therefore we expect system volume to decline in Japan quarter-to-quarter. Excluding Japan, non-U.S. system sales decreased attributable to reduced capital spending in a challenging European economic environment. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, let me remind you that there were no costs deferred in conjunction with the first quarter 2009 revenue deferral, and therefore, the $20 deferral had an equal impact on revenue, gross profit and operating income. Gross margin in the first quarter was 73% compared with the first quarter 2009 gross margin, excluding the impact of the deferral of 71%, and compared with fourth quarter 2009 gross margin of 72%. The increase in gross margin reflects increased system ASPs, material cost reductions and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base. First quarter 2010 operating expenses of $111 million were up 32% compared with the first quarter of 2009 and up 6% compared with the fourth quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter and increased investment in research and development. We added 94 employees during the quarter, including 49 employees in the sales service organization as we continue to expand our clinical sales force and 39 employees in operations as we continue to grow manufacturing capacity and invest in research and development. First quarter 2010 operating income was $130 million or 40% of sales compared with $65 million or 31% of sales for the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of the deferral, and $128 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2009. First quarter 2010 operating income reflected $27 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $23 million for the first quarter of 2009 and $25 million last quarter. The growth in non-cash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of each year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 36% was lower than our 2009 rate of 41%, reflecting the implementation of our international tax structure. Our net income was $85 million or $2.12 per share compared with $40 million or $1.02 per share for the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of the deferral, and $78 million or $1.95 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Now, moving to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter of 2010 with cash and investments of $1.396 billion, up $224 million compared with December 31, 2009. The increase during the quarter reflects $153 million of cash flows from operations and $93 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $16 million of capital expenditures. $3 million of our capital expenditures relate to the construction of our new manufacturing facility next to our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale. We anticipate that building to be completed in early 2011. Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $180 million at March 31 from $205 million at December 31. The decrease in accounts receivable reflects the timing of system shipments. Our net inventory increased to $69 million at March 31 from $58 million at December 31. We increased inventory during the quarter since we believe that inventory at December 31 was below optimal level. We will likely continue to increase inventory levels in future quarters. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the first quarter, we sold 104 da Vinci Systems, 80 in the United States, 11 in Europe and 13 in the rest of world markets. As part of the 104 system sales, 17 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 87 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,482 the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide; 1091 in the U.S., 264 in Europe and 127 in rest of world markets. 44 of the 104 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. Also during the quarter, nine customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S Systems into da Vinci Si Systems. The outlier this quarter was Japan with 7 da Vinci placements. As was stated earlier, several of these placements were sold to early Japanese thought leaders who were anxiously awaiting Shonin clearance and importation rights. Although we’re pleased with these sales, we don’t expect this rate of Japanese purchases to continue for the near future. Clinically, we had another nice quarter with good sequential procedure growth within our targeted procedures. da Vinci Hysterectomy and Prostatectomy showed solid growth, whereas partial nephrectomy, sacrocolpopexy, ENT and colon and rectal procedures showed large percentage of sequential growth. Within our hysterectomy business for the first time in several quarters, dVH for malignant conditions showed larger sequential growth than dVH for benign conditions. It’s difficult to say for certain why that was, but it’s our belief that three factors probably played a role; one, the Q1 reset of co-payment minimum spending; two, high unemployment rates; and three, the difficult sales force task of simultaneously managing multiple high growth procedure businesses. The latter we can do something about. In fact, we’ve recently made some adjustments to our sales structure to better support the large benign hysterectomy market. During the quarter, nearly 300 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts appeared within various peer reviewed journals. With the current trend in health care policy moving directionally toward comparative effectiveness research, it’s our belief that we’ll be well positioned in the evidence-based environment. With volumes of peer reviewed da Vinci publications already in print, as well as more due to be published, clinicians, policymakers and patients are in position to make informed health care decisions. As we’ve said before, comparative effectiveness research done well is something we very much support. As it pertains to dVP versus open prostatectomy, an excellent comparative study out of Vanderbilt University was recently published in The Journal of Urology. The paper emanated out of the University’s Department of Urology and Biostatistics and is entitled “Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus radical retropubic prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer; comparison of short-term biochemical recurrence free survival.” 1,904 men represented the cohort study between June of 2003 and January of 2008 where 491 received an open retropubic prostatectomy and 1,413 received a dVP. As you might suspect, the study is filled with detailed analysis from which I’ll spare you today, but I’d encourage those of you interested to pick up a copy and read through it yourselves. To summarize, the three-year biochemical recurrence free survival rate was statistically similar between the da Vinci Prostatectomy and the radical retropubic prostatectomy groups on the whole, as well as, when stratified by pathological stage, grade and margins status on a multivariate analysis, extracapsular extension, pathological grade 7 or greater and positive surgical margin were independent predictors of biochemical recurrence, while surgical approach was not. The authors concluded by saying, “The likelihood of biochemical recurrence was similar between groups when stratified by known risk factors of recurrence. Surgical approach was not a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence in the multivariate model. Our analysis is suggestive of comparative effectiveness for robotic-assisted prostatectomy.” Of all the desired endpoints associated with prostatectomy, none is more important than cancer control. One of the fastest growing procedures that you haven’t heard a great deal about is da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy. Sacrocolpopexy is performed for the condition of vaginal vault prolapse and has an estimated annual U.S. market opportunity of between 60,000 and 70,000 patients. The gold standard surgical approach for this debilitating condition is an open sacrocolpopexy. But since this approach requires a laparotomy, which is associated with longer hospitalization and increased blood loss, the postoperative road to recovery is often slow and painful as compared with less invasive approaches. Traditional laparoscopic approaches were introduced nearly 15 years ago, and in the hands of skilled laparoscopists can be an alternative to the open approach. However, laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is considered technically challenging due to its limitations, such as lack of depth perception and surgical access required for difficult suture placements. da Vinci is rapidly proving capable in overcoming these clinical and technical challenges. A paper out of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Rochester Medical Center entitled “Recovery after robotic-assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy; the patients’ perspective,” authored by McNanley, Buchsbaum, et al, look closely at the patients perioperative experience. In their analysis, patients were queried about resumption of activities, such as work, driving, bowel function, whether recovery went as expected and whether they would recommend this surgery to others. Use of pain medication, pain scores and perioperative data were collected. N was 21 patients, which is admittedly small, but smaller than desired sample sizes is the reality of evaluating procedures that are still in the early part of the adoption curve. Be that as it may, I think it’s pretty significant when 100% of the respondents stated that they would recommend a da Vinci sacrocolpopexy to a friend, 72% indicated that their recover went better than expected, 28% felt that the recovery went as expected and zero felt that the recovery went worse than expected. Patient advocates had been a powerful component to the success of several da Vinci procedures. So we’re encouraged when we hear the early reports on an emerging procedure support this trend. Over the past few quarters you’ve heard us describe substantive product development projects aimed toward the general and colorectal surgery markets. We’ve also highlighted that colorectal, and specifically, low rectal cancer resections are among our fastest growing procedures. The number of peer-reviewed publications in these specialties has grown rapidly and this past quarter was no exception. In the Annals of Surgical Oncology, a study entitled “Multicentric Study on Robotic Tumor-Specific Mesorectal Excision for the Treatment of Rectal Cancer” was published. It was a prospective three center study on 143 consecutive patients, which, for the record, was analyzed by an independent researcher. The three centers included City of Hope National Cancer Center in California, the European Institute of Oncology in Milan and Hospital San Matteo in Spoleto, Italy. In their commentary, the author stated that to the best of their knowledge the present study evaluating robotic-assisted tumor-specific rectal surgery represents the largest series ever published with the longest follow-up period. The majority of the patient cohort had either mid or low rectal tumor and 65% received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Even though both conditions are known to render surgical dissection demanding successful excisions were successfully completed in over 95% of the patients and successful restoration of bowel continuity was achieved in 78.3% of them. Margin clearance was obtained in all, but one patient, with a number of harvested nodes that compares favorably with that of open and laparoscopic series. Survival curve analysis revealed a three-year overall survival rate of 97% and local recurrence were not found during mean follow-up of 17.4 months. When discussing the technical differences between laparoscopy and robotic approaches, the author stated, and I quote, “Laparoscopy offers an optimal tumor specific mesorectal excision or TME with intact pelvic fascia and even greater accuracy than the open technique, but use of non-articulated forceps, camera tremor and surgeon fatigue make this procedure demanding and restricted to a few centers. Robotic TME seems to enhance microdissection accuracy, leading to a better and more comfortable mesorectal dissection with a lower risk of circumferential resection margin.” Later, the authors went on to say, and again I quote, “We feel that robotic surgery could dramatically change the standard approach to rectal cancer employed to-date.” This week the 12th World Congress of The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons or SAGES convenes in Landover, Maryland. This year Intuitive will have a bigger presence than in the years past. Clinical prototypes of our single-site product for single incision da Vinci surgery will be on display at our booth. But to be clear, these products are early within the FDA clearance process and should not be viewed as commercially available products at this stage. However, da Vinci multiport, general and colorectal surgery products and procedures, which are commercially available, will be discussed and featured within various conference sessions. Our product development and marketing groups have been very active in the area of general and colorectal surgery, and the reason is simple. It’s our belief and the belief of many of our customers that the benefits of da Vinci surgery can positively affect a number of patients being treated within these specialties. Though we are in the early phases of procedure adoption within these specialties, the early indicators appear positive. That concludes my remarks, and I’ll now turn the time over to Ben.
Ben Gong: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010, including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures, as Gary mentioned, our procedures this past quarter grew 37% over the year ago first quarter. We continue to expect our total procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the approximately 205,000 procedures performed in 2009. Moving on to revenues, based on the upside we recorded in the first quarter, we are increasing our forecast for annual revenue growth to 27% to 30%, which is up from our previous estimate of 25%. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as system placements may vary. With regard to our Japan revenues, as previously mentioned, while we sold seven systems in Q1, we do not expect to maintain this level of quarterly system sales in Japan for the balance of 2010. With regard to gross margin, the 73% margin we achieved in Q1 was higher than in previous quarters due to higher ASPs on systems and manufacturing efficiencies. We expect ASPs to return to historical levels. As Gary indicated, we will continue to share productivity gains with our customers, and as a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 72% for the year. Moving to operating expense, we are making significant investments across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. We now expect our total GAAP operating expense to grow by 27% to 29% in 2010 compared with our previous forecast of 25% growth. In terms of non-cash expenses, we expect to report stock compensation charges of approximately $122 million in 2010, which is a little lower than our previous forecast of $127 million. In addition, previous purchases of intellectual property are scheduled to amortize in our R&D line at approximately $15 million for the year. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, is expected to come in between $16 million and $18 million for the year. With regard to income tax, as Marshall mentioned earlier, we have begun taking advantage of the international tax structure we created to report a lower tax rate this year. We recorded a 36.2% tax rate for Q1 and we expect to record the same rate for the full year. This is a significant improvement over the 41% tax rate we reported for 2009. For calculating earnings per share, we ended the first quarter with 39.2 million common shares outstanding and approximately 5.1 million options shares outstanding. Depending on our average stock price this year, a portion of the 5.1 million option shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation. Assuming our stock price remains where it is today, we estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q2 will be approximately 40.6 million shares and for calculating EPS for the year, we estimate it will be approximately 40.8 million shares. Finally, regarding our cash flows, since we are forecasting to report over $137 million in non-cash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income. Once again, cash flows from operations in Q1 were $153 million compared with our net income of $85 million. And with that, we’d like to open the call to your questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions).
Ben Gong: Operator, can you check to see that the callers can actually dial in for questions?
Operator: I will double check. (Operator instructions).
Ben Gong: Operator, I just received a message that it’s not working on their end.
Gary Guthart: Looks like it’s just come up.
Ben Gong: Okay.
Operator: I have a question from Tao Levy.
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank: Hey, good afternoon, guys. It’s Tao Levy from Deutsche Bank.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon.
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank: So, first question, you mentioned on the call a comment about sharing productivity gains with customers and I’m just wondering if you could go into that a little bit more. You’re talking about sort of discounts providing for your equipment, I just wasn’t sure about that. Thanks.
Gary Guthart: It’s Gary. Just a combination of things. I think one thing is that as we move into more price sensitive procedure markets, we expect that margin levels may fluctuate. The other thing is as we bring online technologies for training and networking and things like simulation, those were opportunities to help our customer and may have really a different margin profile.
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank: Tao Levy Thanks, that’s helpful. And you also talked about the sales force adds. So I was wondering if you could go into are you adding them by indication, are you adding them internationally? And then also just lastly on the international front in Europe, with sort of the headwinds that you were seeing, was that new from the beginning of the year, did they start at the end of last year because Q4 was pretty robust, Q1, obviously, a little bit choppier? And is that kind of what you are seeing going forward kind of continued choppiness until that macro environment improves? Thanks.
Gary Guthart: I’ll let Ben to take up.
Ben Gong: Thanks. I think the first part was sales force. As I mentioned, we added 49 people to our sales and marketing group and about 40 of those were in the field this past quarter. So, part of that comment is we’re still adding quite a few people to the sales force and we continue to hire a lot of folks. With regard to the last part of the question, European demand, one thing I would say is that, just want to point out; procedures in Europe grew very well in the quarter which makes us feel good about the overall health of that business. Now, system sales were down in the quarter, and you’re right, it did fluctuate a little bit from Q4 to Q1. But generally speaking, we think that there is a challenging economic environment in Europe and that’s making system sales in Europe under some pressure.
Gary Guthart: How long that’s going to last we don’t know.
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank: I don’t know that it’s anything different than you’re seeing in the general descriptions in the broader economic markets. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Ben Andrew.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Just wanted to follow-up on something, Aleks, that you mentioned, the notion of changing the sales structure to better support benign hysterectomy. Can you talk about that a little bit more?
Aleks Cukic: Yes, and again, I think I would ask you to not overstate that. In other words, we’ve added some GYN specialists in the area. And the focus again if you look at with respect to the GYN community and specifically the benign GYN segment, it’s really spread out. That’s a procedure that’s done in a lot of different places and there are a lot of people that own large practices. So we’re really trying to focus some specialists, if you will, in that area, so they don’t have to make the decision on should they go and support a prostatectomy case or a partial nephrectomy case. Believe me, there is a lot of integration that is going to be natural in the sales organization, but we’re really looking to bolster that side of it a little bit more.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: And do you see a similar dynamic as you move into some of these other procedures because you’re obviously talking about some good growth in a pretty wide variety of procedure codes. You’ve obviously done this in cardio; you’re doing it a bit now in GYN, and do you see that as something maybe you end up with more frequently?
Aleks Cukic: I don’t think we’re in any position to say that this is any sort of a long-term strategy. I think we’re really looking at it from the perspective of where is the opportunity and what are the vital few things we can do to really attack that opportunity right now? Longer term, based on once a product is put out, once there is a clear understanding of the choreography of the sales person’s territory, those things will get visited. But it’s way too early to say that it should be something you should expect in future.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: And then just briefly on Japan, the seven systems that went out, do you have a sense of what those thought leaders will be doing with the product before you get to Shonin and really are able to move forward and promote the product?
Gary Guthart: We do have the Shonin, so they can go ahead and use it. We have basically all indications that we have in the U.S. except for pediatric, cardiac, although we do have thoracic and ENT. So they can use it. It’s reimbursement that we don’t have yet. And we’ll see a mix of those different procedures across that set of customers.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: So in terms of not having the reimbursement though, how does that constrain you in the near-term with the product?
Gary Guthart: I think until we have reimbursement, the broad adoption will be constrained, and that’s because of the way they have to go through their mix billing process. In other words, there is not really a mechanism for them to do private pay.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Okay, thanks.
Operator: David Lewis has a question.
James – Morgan Stanley: Hi, guys, this is actually James [ph] in for David. I had a question about the EU market. Obviously, very strong procedure results over there, but how is the procedure mix and adoption curve OUS developing compared to the U.S.? And is prostatectomy still the driving force on the OUS growth or are you seeing a little bit of a different development there?
Aleks Cukic: I think generally speaking there has been a lag between outside the U.S. markets and the U.S. So the answer to the second part of that question, yes, prostatectomy is a big driver outside the United States. It’s still a driver within the United States, but it’s a bigger driver outside the United States, as it pertains to the percentage of their overall procedures. So, if you look at the GYN side, there is a lag there which you would expect. The numbers in terms of a percentage sequentially or for the past few quarters has been strong, but it’s out of a much lower base. So, I think, in general, it’s our expectation that there will be a lag. The OUS markets will lag the broader U.S. market. Now, there may be exceptions on a country-by-country basis, but generally speaking, that’s the case.
James – Morgan Stanley: Right. And as you try to make a bigger push into general and colorectal surgery, what gives you the confidence there that you could be as successful, general surgery both from a share and margin perspective, where there is much more focus and pressure on procedural cost in those areas?
Aleks Cukic: I think you started the question correctly with the separation of general and colorectal, and I think you could continue to sub-segmentize it even further. So, I think what we have always believed is where there is great patient value; we stand a very good chance to be rapidly adopted. Now, I’d just say within some of those procedures in the broader category you find that laparoscopy has been introduced or had been introduced 15 years ago or as many as 20 years ago in some of those areas, but the penetration is very low. Why? Because it’s technically demanding. And so, what we have found in the past is where those procedures have been technically demanding laparoscopically, where we can prove capable, we tend to have rapid adoption. We are not saying anything about margins in those areas or really giving anything beyond that other than if we can find procedures with high patient value, which we believe there are several, then we believe we’ll be successful.
James – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Could you give us some detail on what the two or three most attractive general or colorectal procedures might be for you?
Aleks Cukic: I think if you looked at it by some of the peer reviewed literature that’s out there or the anticipation from the surgeon categories, low rectal cancer really sticks out. If you look at low rectal cancers, there is laparoscopic colorectal surgery being done all over the United States and all over the world. But when you get to the low rectal cancers, those tend to be restricted to a few centers, high volume centers. There seems to be a lot of consistency between that anatomy, obviously, and the male pelvic anatomy in working in prostatectomy. The same challenges that existed in laparoscopic prostatectomy exist in laparoscopic low rectal cancers. So, there are some indicators there that I think are favorable. When you’re moving up into general thoracic sort of non-cardiac thoracic operations, that could be a large area, and again, I think the same thing can be said there. And then within general surgery, we will see. It’s too early. There are different platforms, as I mentioned, that we’re showing. And we’ll just see where some of those products land.
James – Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks, guys. I will jump back in queue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: Hey, good afternoon. Maybe just coming out of the conference in Orlando this week, can you talk a little bit more about your thoughts on single port and maybe talk a little bit about the market opportunity, how attractive is the market beyond gallbladder for that initial product? And any color you can give us around how you are thinking about pricing or consumable use would be helpful? I know it’s early but –
Aleks Cukic: It is early, and therefore, there is really not a lot of depth that I’m going to or any of us really will go through at this point. As a reminder, we’re not through the FDA. And so, we are certainly going to be very cautious and careful recognizing that we’re not even approved yet, so we’re not going to make any claims. I think, generally, from a sort of 5,000-foot level, when we look at some of those procedures, if we look at where the multipuncture or the multiport da Vinci procedures have not been able to penetrate, they tend to be in some of the “simpler procedures” within general surgery. So, anything we’re able to really pick up in that area we look at as accretive. And beyond that, it’s really hard for me to go into great detail whether it would be laparoscopic Collis or some of the other high volume, low technical challenging procedures, it’s hard to say. We will wait until it comes out, until we start doing some procedures in abundance, and we can start looking at the data and really determining what the value is going to be.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: Okay. Can you talk a little bit about how the transoral is doing? You talked about, I think last quarter about some of the initial ENT procedures. How is that ramping?
Aleks Cukic: I think if you look at it, again, as a reminder, coming off of a small base. When we look at the procedures, there was very strong growth on a sequential basis, but it’s off a small base. If you look at the interest within the community, I think you said you were at the World Congress on Robotic Surgery, the expectations I think were exceeded in terms of the number of ENT surgeons that attended that conference and that attended the various sessions. If you look at the request for training and some of the other sort of early indicators, they all appear positive. So, we’re pleased with the early progress. We know in our minds and in the minds of a lot of our customers that there is high patient value there and we get excited about procedures where we can do that.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: Could you maybe also comment just briefly on how you view the competitive dynamic with external beam radiation therapy? There was a new LINAC introduced yesterday from Varian, and clearly, they talked more about trying to go after prostate a little bit more aggressively. Can you just comment on whether you feel a need to fund clinical studies or how you view the competitive dynamic there?
Gary Guthart: There are several studies ongoing now that look at prostate cancer treatment first between open surgery, robotic surgery and different forms of radiation therapy. I think the way we look at it is the patient population is segmented. So, for the younger patients, surgery makes a lot of sense. There is a lot of data that indicates that surgical resections result in better long-term cancer outcomes than radiation. And where other discussion comes in is kind of is the patient’s age. And I think we’ll have to see. We’re certainly not ready to make any claims about what their new products can or cannot do, and we have several studies I think in the works that we’ll publish over the next few years.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: And then just one last one, maybe for Ben, any updated thoughts on capital deployment priorities? This year you obviously talked about the cash you built up.
Gary Guthart: Why don’t I take that one? As we look at the cash, we really look at it in four buckets. The first bucket is really where in organic need do we have a requirement for cash infusion and we’ve been doing that quarter-over-quarter and we’ll continue to do so. We also look out at technology partnerships that we can initiate or accelerate, and then, acquisitions of technologies that fit well with us. Again, we’ve done that as we’ve gone and the cash gives us the flexibility to do that as we need it. We’ll look at returning cash to shareholders as kind of an anti-dilution measure when the time is right and where it makes sense. And of course, we’ll like to keep some for flexibility. So, it really is that same set of priorities and it really is looking at it quarter-after-quarter and doing what makes sense as we see it.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Ricci.
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo: Hey, guys. Can you hear me, okay?
Gary Guthart: Yes.
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo: First question for you is with regard to a product you have showcasing at SAGES, the simulator product that’s presently on display, what is your strategy and what do you think the market opportunity would be?
Gary Guthart: We really look at that as something that can supplement training, and the goal really simply is to get more comfortable surgeons faster. We don’t look at that as a big revenue opportunity as a direct product line. So we’re not looking out and saying, boy, this is a huge revenue opportunity in and of itself. We really see it as a way to have good outcomes sooner with our existing products. So, you should not be looking at that and modeling with the big revenue stream of trend that simulation is. I think there is a lot of interest in it and a lot of interest that makes sense, but I would view it that way.
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo: And where exactly would you record revenues from that in your P&L?
Marshall Mohr: It’s a physical product, but I think what Gary is mentioning is that the intent of that product is not to be a significant revenue generator, but to be helpful in all the training that we do with surgeons.
Gary Guthart: As we get closer there, we could answer that question.
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo: And since you called it as part of the R&D, you’ve been talking a little bit more about colorectal, could you update us on the progress you’ve made with getting a surgical stapler on the market?
Aleks Cukic: The product, again, this is a reminder, we did a licensing deal a while back and we told you at that time and in subsequent quarters that the project is moving forward. We haven’t put any timelines in place as to when it’s going to be launched. I would just say that the teams are very well resourced, they are very energized and we’re pleased with the progress they’re making.
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo: Okay, great. And then lastly, you touched on this a little bit, you talked about adoption curves for procedures in the past, can you talk just a little bit about the adoption curve internationally for gynecology and specifically dVH?
Aleks Cukic: You broke up little there. Was it gynecology and specifically dVH?
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo: Yes, that’s correct.
Aleks Cukic: Again, I would say that, as a reminder, when we look back retrospectively at the dVP adoption curve between U.S. and OUS, we found it was lagging by a couple of years, if you looked at the overall numbers and you looked at the adoption rate and so on. Having said that, there were countries within Europe that look very similar to the United States. I would say with dVH it is lagging. However, the number is small, but on a sequential basis, it grew very well this quarter. It’s too early to say which countries are going to lead in that, but I think it’s fair to say that the dVH for malignancies is being adopted, let’s say, more rapidly or more uniformly outside the United States than dVH for benign.
Gary Guthart: We have time for two more questions.
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo: All right, thanks, guys.
Operator: I am sorry, is Mr. Ricci done with his question?
Aleks Cukic: Yes.
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo: I just assumed that we were done. Thanks guys for taking the questions.
Gary Guthart: Yes.
Operator: I am sorry; I am having a hard time understanding. Should I move on to the next question?
Ben Gong: Yes, please, operator.
Operator: Rick Wise will have the question.
Miroslava Minkova – Leerink Swann: Hi, guys, it’s actually Miroslava for Rick Wise. Congratulations on another very, very strong quarter. Let me start with asking a capital spending question. I know you discussed Europe in quite a lot of details, but turning to the U.S., the placement here seemed very strong. In fact, if I have this correctly, they didn’t even decline sequentially in what is supposed to be a seasonally weaker first quarter. Now, as the economy rebounds, do you think we can see an acceleration in U.S. da Vinci Si placement given that you do have a new product cycle as well? Any thoughts that you might relate on the capital spending environment here would be appreciated.
Ben Gong: Miroslava, this is Ben. You’re right. We had a pretty strong quarter in the U.S. Again, from a broad standpoint, we take a look at the procedure growth, and in the long-term, system placements are going to be a factor of the need for those systems based off of the procedure growth. And procedures are growing pretty well. As we mentioned that we’re still forecasting 35% procedure growth worldwide and that will lead to system sales. But we’re not speculating too much because these things do tend to vary quarter-to-quarter. They were really strong quarters in both Q4 and Q1, and I don’t know that it would be a fair thing for you to start modeling off of that and then expecting acceleration off of those numbers. We’re not being really specific about it, but we are giving you some top-line guidance on revenues.
Miroslava Minkova – Leerink Swann: Okay. I do appreciate that. Secondly, not to peek on you again, but gross margin you’ve given a guidance of 72%, but again in the last few quarters it has been above that already. Why should gross margins go down so significantly in the next couple of quarters span?
Ben Gong: Actually, this is the only quarter I can recall that it was 73%. In Q4, it was 72% and in the previous quarters it was lower than that. Pricing has been very consistent. So since we launched the Si in Q2 of 2009, all of our pricing for our products has been exactly the same. And you see a little bit of fluctuation due to product mix and customer mix. I think that’s probably just going to be the normal fluctuation you’re going to be seeing. If you just take a look at our historical average on the mixes that we’ve seen, we expect it to come in at 72%.
Miroslava Minkova – Leerink Swann: Okay. And maybe one more, can you update us where you stand with reimbursement in Japan? Is there any time line here that can be forecast? Are we several months away from getting any reimbursement in Japan, are we years away, how do we think about that?
Gary Guthart: Right now, it’s too soon to call. And so, we’re working through with our partners and with the government on how to approach it, and as we get to know more, we’ll let you know.
Miroslava Minkova – Leerink Swann: And let me throw one last one. We are at SAGES as well and I appreciate the comments on colorectal procedures, but there is quite a bit of talk about everything else here like bariatrics, cholecystectomy, including robotics. And I’m just wondering, traditionally, this has not been in your sweet spot so to say, because these have been the easy laparoscopic procedures. How close are you to this opportunity now and is there any instruments that you need to develop, is there any studies that you need to do, are you making any sort of a push into these type of procedures and how big is colorectal in the U.S. in terms of cases?
Aleks Cukic: I think the answer to most of those questions is yes. We will need instrumentation, we will need training pathways, we will need to push for peer reviewed data and so on and so forth. And the answer to that as always is most often going to be yes anytime we move into new areas. And so as far as predictions of where the adoption might be and to which of those sub-segments you said, it’s difficult to say and we won’t speculate. But in terms of overall size of markets, if you look at the GI opportunity and you look at the colorectal opportunity, I believe estimates in the United States are that could approach 200,000. So, I am pleased to hear that there is a lot of excitement around all of those areas. That’s really motivating certainly for us, and that’s why we’re there. I think we have time for one more question, operator. Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from Sameer Harish.
Sameer Harish – Needham & Co.: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. I thought I would start off, you talked on the call about focusing on sales in GYN market, and does this open the door for more interaction at the patient level, possibly direct-to-consumer type marketing?
Aleks Cukic: I wouldn’t read that into the comments. I think, again, what we really strive for is providing patient value and we understand the chain of events there. There is a hospital customer, there is a physician customer and they are the people that own the patient. What we certainly do is provide a lot of information that patients can access to help them, sort of narrow their search as to the various opportunities that are out there. We will always do our best to provide as much information as we can.
Sameer Harish – Needham & Co.: Okay. In terms of the interaction that you are seeing from a customer level at the Web site or through the phone, has there been any change in the way that customers are approaching the company in terms of the procedures that they are asking about or does it mimic the current mix of prostate versus hysterectomy, can you talk about that?
Aleks Cukic: I can’t think of any per se outliers in there. I can say that there is nothing remarkable that stands out in that that is different from what our expectations would be.
Sameer Harish – Needham & Co.: And lastly, I know you don’t typically talk about pipeline products, but can you give us a little bit more detail on the pathway to getting ourselves approved in the U.S.?
Aleks Cukic: Again, we’re in discussions with the FDA, let’s put it that way. But in terms of the process or the timeline, there is really not a lot more we can comment on at that point.
Gary Guthart: That was our last question. As we have said previously, while we focus on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experiences give you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. One patient is Rhonda of Florida. Rhonda describes her experience as follows, “Although I have had a uterine fibroid for years, I have successfully been able to avoid surgery. I had no symptoms and the fibroid was causing no problems, so I couldn’t bring myself to go through my pre-conceived notion of a hysterectomy when it wasn’t absolutely necessary. After my recent ultrasound and subsequent CT scan revealed that it was now impacting my ureter and kidney, I could no longer avoid action. Thankfully, my new OB/GYN, Dr. Carol McKenzie, recommended that I contact Dr. Sam about a da Vinci robotic procedure. I was concerned that the fibroid was too big to even consider a robotic procedure, so I called to check before even making an appointment. I felt very confident that I wanted her to do the surgery, but had previously scheduled a second appointment with a prominent surgeon who had performed this surgery on my friend just a few weeks earlier. At my consultation with him, he was adamant that the fibroid was simply too large to consider anything other than an abdominal hysterectomy. I called Dr. Sam’s office to discuss it, and while she couldn’t guarantee that it could be done robotically, she was 80% to 85% sure that she could do it that way. For me, those were good enough odds and I truly believed that if anyone could do it, she was the one. I went home the day after my surgery, and was able to get up and down the stairs without significant pain, though I moved slowly. 72 hours after my surgery, I felt well enough to go to my daughter’s soccer game and accompany my husband to his holiday party later that evening. Although I was still feeling a little bloated and swollen, for the most part I felt amazing. For me, this experience has underscored how important it is for people to find out the latest treatments available, yet how important it is for people to also realize how critical it is to select the most competent and experienced technician. After years of avoiding this surgery, it’s so nice to finally have it behind me.” Second patient is Doug, a marketing director at a hospital in West Virginia, who describes his experience as follows. “I had been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse as a child, but it had never progressed to anything remarkable until September of 2009, when I began experiencing shortness of breath, chest and back tightness and uncomfortable palpitations. After numerous tests, it was determined that my mitral valve prolapse had progressed to severe mitral regurgitation and that I would need to either have my valve repaired or replaced. After considerable research, I was committed to finding a physician and a facility that could, most importantly, repair my mitral valve. And secondarily, repair it with robotic assistance from the da Vinci Surgical System. My research led me to Dr. Marc Gillinov at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who did a fantastic job repairing both the anterior and posterior leaflets of my mitral valve robotically. My recovery has been remarkably fast and easy. I feel great. And there are no signs of regurgitation or a heart murmur any more. I’m completely fixed. I can’t tell you what a relief it is to know that my health problems are now solved, that my sternum didn’t have to be sawed and spread apart, and that I can look forward to living a long, healthy life with my wonderful family. I truly feel blessed.” Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci Surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that really make a difference. This concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at any time.

Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our fourth quarter and annual financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, and then I will provide a financial forecast for 2010. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. Before we turn it over to Gary, Lonnie would like to provide some introductory remarks.
Lonnie Smith: Thank you, Ben. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the transition that took place on January 1st. On that date, Gary Guthart became President and CEO of the company. It has been my privilege to serve as CEO of Intuitive Surgical for the last 13 years and it's been a great personal blessing to work with so many gifted and dedicated people. I sincerely thank all those past and present who have helped to build this wonderful company, extraordinary men and women who can see, design, build, sales, service and support our effort to great products that take surgery beyond the limits of the human hands and pioneered their application to new surgical procedures, the surgeons who are instrumentally in those pioneering efforts, the hospital administrators who are willing to invest in a new technology with a fledgling company, the patients who trust us and their surgeons to help them and to do no harm in the process and finally, the early investors who provided the funding that made it possible. I truly believe that we are still in early stages of the evolution of this technology and its application to medicine. I look forward to my new role in supporting Gary and the entire Intuitive team as I continue to advance the state of the art of our technology, delivering extraordinary value to patients, surgeons, hospitals and our investors. That said, I'll pass the time to our President and CEO, Gary Guthart.
Gary Guthart: Thank you, Lonnie. Against the backdrop of significant uncertainty in 2009, our team adapted well to the changing environment in our procedure and capital businesses and our operations; organization remained focused on delivering quality products in the midst of financial constraints. Our operating highlights for the fourth quarter are as follows. Procedures grew 44% over the fourth quarter of 2008. We sold 110 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 85 sold during the fourth quarter of last year. Our international team contributed 30 of the 110 systems sold. We ended the fourth quarter with 1,395 da Vinci systems installed worldwide. Total revenue for the quarter was $323 million, up 40% over fourth quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $113 million, up 39%. Total recurring revenue including service grew to $161 million, up 37% from the prior year and comprising 50% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $153 million before non-cash stock compensation expenses, up 47% from the fourth quarter of last year and GAAP net income grew to $78 million, up 53% from fourth quarter of last year. For the full year of 2009, worldwide procedures grew by 51% over 2008. Our international procedures grew by 60% over 2008. We sold 338 da Vinci surgical systems in the year. Total revenue grew to $1.052 billion, up 20% over 2008. Recurring revenue grew to $562 million, up 34% and comprising 53% of total revenue. We generated $474 million in operating profit before non-cash stock compensation expense, up 22% from last year and GAAP net income grew to $233 million, up 14% year-over-year. We ended the year with $1.172 billion in cash and investments, up $148 million from last quarter and up $270 million from last year, which excluding $59 million in cash received during the year from the exercise of stock options and adding back $15 million invested in intellectual property, working capital, property, plant and equipment and $150 million stock buyback during the year, amounts to gross cash generated from operations of $377 million or $9.61 per fully diluted share and 162% of a reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of the significant non-cash stock compensation and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason that we continue to believe that gross cash generated by operations remains the best measure of our actual financial performance. Adoption of surgical robotics is procedure-specific and patient-driven and as a consequence, we continue to drive the adoption of robotically assisted surgery procedure by procedure. Some of our highest growth procedures, those with 100% year-over-year growth or higher for 2009, include hysterectomy, partial nephrectomy, sacrocolpopexy, colon and rectal resections, and thyroidectomy, the latter concentrated in Asia. Some of these procedure growth metrics are measured off relatively small base in 2008, but we have learnt from past experience that the seeds of new adoptions begin with rapid growth in particular procedures. Through 2009, we continued to invest and progress across our business. Some highlights for the year are as follows. We launched our Si system in Q2 of 2009 and by Q4, 79% of new system sales were our Si product. The Si system has catalyzed trade-in sales for our first platform, the da Vinci Standard and upgrades of da Vinci S systems with 23 trade-in transactions and 10 S to Si upgrades in the fourth quarter. Si Dual Consoles were sold in 16% of Si system sales through the year, representing an opportunity for increased training efficacy at those sites. We obtained FDA approval for a new indication of da Vinci systems for TransOral da Vinci surgery, procedures for which patient value is very high. We added 214 new employees over the year, ending 2009 with 1,263 on our team and we resumed construction of our new manufacturing facility at our Sunnyvale headquarters, which will bring online 155,000 square feet of space in 2011. I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer, to take us through our financial performance in greater detail.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our fourth quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. As previously reported, we offered certain first quarter customers the opportunity to upgrade their da Vinci S systems to da Vinci Si systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessories in exchange for da Vinci Si accessories. As a result, we deferred a total of $20.1 million of revenue in the first quarter. In our second quarter, we recognized $13.8 million of the total $20.1 million originally deferred. In our third quarter, we recognized the remaining first quarter deferred revenue of $6.3 million as we completed the 13 remaining upgrades in the third quarter. To provide listeners with comparable information, I will now walk you through our revenue results excluding the third quarter recognition of $6.3 million. Our fourth quarter revenue was $323 million, up 40% compared with $232 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 18% compared with $274 million for the third quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter revenues by product category are as follows. Fourth quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $113 million, up 39% compared with $82 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 13% compared with $100 million in the third quarter of 2009. The increases compared with prior quarters are driven by procedure growth. Specifically, procedures increased 44% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Also impacting instrument and accessory growth is revenue associated with initial stocking orders which was higher than the prior year. The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we realized per procedure including stock – initial stocking orders was approximately $1,960 per procedure, down approximately $70 per procedure compared to last year and up approximately $40 per procedure compared to the third quarter. The decline in revenue per procedure compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 reflects the lower impact that initial stocking orders have on a larger installed base, as well as customer efficiency. The growth in revenue per procedure compared to the third quarter is primarily associated with customer buying patterns. Fourth quarter 2009 systems revenue of $162 million increased 42% compared with $114 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of 25% compared with $130 million of systems revenue for the third quarter. We sold 110 systems in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 85 systems last year and 86 systems last quarter. 80 systems were sold in the U.S. during the quarter compared with 55 systems last year and 72 systems last quarter. 30 systems were sold outside the U.S. compared with 30 last year and 14 last quarter. 87 of the 110 or 79% of the units sold in the quarter were da Vinci Si systems. 23 of the systems sold in the quarter involve trade-ins of da Vinci Standard systems compared to six in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 20 last quarter. We continue to provide customers with trade-in credits as we believe that the Si system provides clinical and user benefits over da Vinci Standards, which we believe will lead to increased system usage. Fourth quarter system revenue also included $7 million of upgrade revenue compared to $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $10 million in the third quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter average sales price per system including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades and the revenue deferral was $1.41 million, an increase from the $1.39 million realized in the third quarter and an increase from the $1.32 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase compared to the prior year reflects the introduction of the Si product, which has a higher price point than the S. The increase from the prior quarter reflects a higher mix of European direct sales. Service revenue increased to $48 million, up 32% compared with $36 million last year and up 9% compared with $44 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total fourth quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory, and service revenue increased to $161 million, up 37% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 12% compared with the third quarter of 2009. Recurring revenue represented 50% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 51% in the fourth quarter last year and 53% last quarter. Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Let me remind you that there were no cost deferred in conjunction with the first quarter $20.1 million revenue deferral and therefore the $6.3 million third quarter recognition had an equal impact on revenue, gross profit, operating income, and pretax income. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 72.2% compared with fourth quarter 2008 gross margin of 71.4% and excluding the impact of the deferral, third quarter 2009 gross margin of 70.4%. The increase in gross margin reflects increased system ASPs and absorption of fixed costs over our larger revenue base. Fourth quarter 2009 operating expenses of $105 million were up 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 11% compared with the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects commissions associated with higher revenue, costs associated with 75 employees added during the quarter and increased research and development costs. In addition, patent amortization expenses increased to $3.6 million for the quarter compared with $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 and $3.6 million last quarter. Fourth quarter 2009 operating income was $128 million or 40% of sales compared with $83 million or 36% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 and excluding the impact of deferral, $98 million or 36% of sales for the third quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2009 operating income reflected $25 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $21 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $25 million last quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 41.5% was slightly higher than our anticipated rate of 41% due to a higher mix of U.S. income. Our net income was $78 million or $1.95 per share compared with $51 million or $1.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 and excluding the impact of the deferral, $61 million or $1.55 per share for the third quarter of 2009. Let me summarize our results for 2009. Total procedures grew by 51% compared to 2008 to approximately 205,000 procedures. Total 2009 revenue was $1.052 billion, up 20% compared with $875 million last year. Recurring revenues, driven by procedure growth, an increase of 34% compared to 2008. Systems revenue increased 8%, reflecting the impact of curtailed hospital spending for capital equipment. Operating income for 2009 was $377 million, up 21% compared with $311 last year. Operating income included $97 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2009 compared with $77 million in 2008. Net income for 2009 was $233 million or $5.93 per share compared with $204 million or $5.12 per share last year. Now, moving to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter of 2009 with cash and investments of $1.172 billion, up $148 million compared with September 30, 2009 and up $270 million compared with December 31st, 2008. The increase during the quarter reflects cash flow from operations and $25 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $8 million of capital expenditures. For the year, cash flow from operations of $385 million and stock option exercises of $59 million was partially offset by IP purchases and capital expenditures of $53 million and the $150 million used to buy back and retire 1.4 million shares of common stock. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $205 million at December 31st from $187 million at September 30th. The increase in receivables reflects increased revenue. Our net inventory increased to $58 million at December 31st from $57 million at September 30. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: Thank you, Marshall. During the fourth quarter, we sold 110 da Vinci systems, 80 in the United States, 21 in Europe, and nine into rest of world markets. As part of the 110 system sales, 23 Standard da Vinci systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We had a net 87 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,395, the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 1,028 in the U.S., 248 in Europe, and 119 in rest of world markets. 52 of the 110 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers, which included a five-system sale to the Cleveland Clinic. Internationally, we placed four more da Vinci systems into France and three more into the countries of Germany, Italy, and Korea. Also during the quarter, 10 customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S systems into da Vinci Si systems. Clinically, we had another excellent quarter, once again experiencing double-digit sequential procedure growth. Demand for our targeted da Vinci procedures continues to be robust. Hysterectomy growth, both for benign and malignant conditions, continues to lead the way. In 2009, our customers performed approximately 69,000 dVH's worldwide, which is an estimated doubling of the 2008 total. dVP, which is still our largest individual procedure, showed solid growth for the year, registering an estimated 90,000 procedures worldwide. Overall, we finished 2009 having completed an estimated 205,000 procedures, representing several different procedure categories. In addition, nearly 300 da Vinci-related clinical publications and abstracts within various peer-reviewed journals during the quarter. Also during the quarter, we were notified by the Japanese Ministry of Health that da Vinci S along with several da Vinci instruments received Shonin clearance in Japan. We worked hard with the Japanese authorities to obtain this clearance, so we are certainly pleased to have received – however, we would like to remind everyone that our work pertaining to the appropriate reimbursement is ongoing and reimbursement activities will likely be ongoing for sometime to come. Shonin clearance was a necessary first step in a process that is still being sequenced. Long-term success in Japan is likely to occur step by step and at this time, we cannot provide an accurate estimate as to when we might obtain the appropriate reimbursement for da Vinci surgical procedures. At current growth trajectories, dVH will become our largest procedure at some point in 2010. And the reasons for this are simple. The market opportunity is large, hospitals and physicians are adopting it, and patients are seeking it. In the October edition of the Journal of Robotic Surgery, Dr. Gerald Feuer and colleagues from the Southeastern Gynecologic Oncology Group in Atlanta published results of their 52-patient comparison for radical dVH versus open hysterectomy. While still in their da Vinci learning curve, they compared complication rates, operating time, lymph node yields, estimated blood loss and hospitalization. They reported that operating times were initially longer when using da Vinci, but had come down significantly with experience. They also showed that complication rates were reduced by 37% using da Vinci. Lymph node yields were similar, while estimated blood loss for da Vinci patients was reduced by 64% compared to their open cases. But perhaps most striking was the difference in hospitalization, which was reduced from 5.2 days for open to 1.7 days with da Vinci. The authors concluded by saying and I quote, "Implementing a unilateral approach to maximizing surgical efficiency greatly reduced surgical times without compromising patient morbidity, bringing down robotic times while still in a learning curve to close to those for radical hysterectomy. Thus, robotic radical hysterectomy may soon be considered the preferred standard front-line therapy for cervical cancer," close quote. dVH for malignant conditions is growing rapidly, but dVH for benign conditions is growing even faster. In a study published last – in last quarters, Journal of Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons, Dr. Abraham Shashoua and colleagues from the University of Illinois, Chicago compared patient characteristics, operating variables, and outcomes in 68 patients that had undergone a dVH or total laparoscopic hysterectomy. They reported that when you factored out morcellation times, operating times were similar. Interestingly, length of stay was reduced approximately 30% from 1.4 days to one day for dVH. In parallel with the reduction of hospitalization was the significant decrease and requisite pain-reducing narcotics, 5.0 units for the total laparoscopic patients versus 1.2 units for the dVH patients. In his summary, Dr. Shashoua stated, and I quote, "Robotic hysterectomy can be performed safely with comparable operative times to those for conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy. Postoperative measures were improved over measures for conventional laparoscopy," close quote. As you can assess from the procedure totals I reported earlier, we showed solid 23% dVP growth in 2009. The overall procedure growth on a raw unit basis was split fairly evenly between the U.S. and international customer base. However, our international dVP business is expanding at a much faster rate compared to the U.S. We would expect this to continue going forward. There is growing international awareness for dVP, the evidence of which can be found in a recent edition of The British Journal of Urology International. The British Journal featured a large meta-analysis of 15 dVP publications published between 2006 and 2009, representing 9,277 dVP patients. The authors were comprised of a cohort of international investigators representing Florida Hospital in Celebration, Florida; the Division of Urology from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; the Division of Oncology from the Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy. The large body of patients studied provided ample evidence for the authors to make the following summary comments, and I quote, "Many series are now mature enough to show the safety, efficiency and reproducibility of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy; robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is associated with decreased operative blood loss and decreased risk of transfusions in comparative studies with open radical prostatectomy. Excellent functional and oncologic outcomes were reported in large series, with results at least comparable to those reported in open radical prostatectomy series. Limited preliminary studies appear to show advantages of robotic procedures in terms of length of stay, positive surgical margin rates and early potency and continence," close quote. We are exiting 2009 with strong international dVP momentum, which will be helpful in addressing this large opportunity. On December 16th, the U.S. FDA granted us 510(k) clearance for TransOral otolaryngologic surgical procedures for benign as well as malignant T1 and T2 tumors. Prior to this clearance, physicians seeking to perform ENT procedures were required to obtain an IRB. Despite the additional steps this process mandated, several of our nation's leading head and neck cancer centers applied for and received IRB clearances. Participating institutions included the University of Pennsylvania; Mayo Clinic, Rochester; M.D. Anderson; Mount Sinai, New York; and the University of Alabama, Birmingham to name a few. Several hundred cases were performed during the year with excellent early results. At least three significant publications appeared in major head and neck journals, several abstracts presented at various meetings, and a number of training sessions took place during 2009. The long-term ENT opportunity is difficult to size, but with current approvals, we would estimate the immediate U.S. target market to represent approximately 10,000 procedures compared to an international market opportunity in excess of 70,000 procedures. The potential patient value being described by leading physicians is very encouraging and perhaps as great as any we've seen thus far. We are excited by the opportunity of working with the ENT surgical community in the pursuit of improving head and neck patient care. That concludes my remarks and I'll now turn the time over to Ben.
Ben Gong: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing our financial forecast for 2010 including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility over expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures, we continue to see strong growth across a wide range of procedures, particularly da Vinci hysterectomies and as a result, we expect our total procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the 205,000 procedures performed in 2009. Moving on to revenues, we expect to achieve annual revenue growth of approximately 25%. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as system placements may vary. With regard to gross margin, we have averaged between 71% and 71.5% over the past two years. While gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to product and geography mix, we expect the average for 2010 to be about the same. Moving to operating expense, we expect our GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 25% in 2010, which is in line with our expected top line growth. Excluding non-cash stock compensation charges, we expect operating expense to grow approximately 23% to 24%. We are continuing to hire significant resources in the field to support newly installed systems and to drive procedure growth and we are continuing to invest in R&D projects to drive growth in our long-term business. We expect our non-cash stock compensation charges to increase from $97 million recorded in 2009 to approximately $127 million in 2010. In addition, we will continue to amortize previous purchases of intellectual property in our R&D expense line, which is scheduled to amortize at $14.5 million for the year. These items total over $140 million in estimated non-cash expense for the year. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, has been decreasing due to lower interest rates on our cash investments. We expect other income to come in between $14 million and $15 million for the year, which is down from approximately $19 million last year. With regard to income tax, we have implemented an international tax structure that will allow us to begin reporting a lower tax rate going forward. We expect our tax rate for 2010 to come in at approximately 37%, which is 4 points lower than the 41% tax rate we reported for 2009. For calculating earnings per share, we ended 2009 with 38.5 million common shares outstanding and approximately 4.6 million option shares outstanding. Depending on our average stock price this year, a portion of the 4.6 million option shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation. Assuming our stock price remains where it is today, we estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 will be approximately 40.1 million shares, and for calculating EPS for the year, we estimate it will be approximately 40.7 million shares. Finally, regarding our cash flows, as Gary mentioned, we generated $377 million in gross cash flow from operations in 2009 compared with our reported net income of $233 million. Since we are forecasting to report over $140 million in non-cash expense this year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income. Please note that the forecast I have just provided does not include any potential impact of a federal health care excise tax. Since we cannot predict if or when such a tax will take effect, we are not making any estimates. And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Gary.
Gary Guthart: Thanks, Ben. This concludes our prepared remarks. Before we move to our Q&A, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge our Chairman, Lonnie Smith. Lonnie has been our CEO since 1997 and has led the organization masterfully over his tenure. While organizations are not built by a single individual, Lonnie's influence on our culture and his leadership in times good and bad has been truly inspirational. I thank him personally and on behalf of our entire team and I look forward to his ongoing contributions as Chairman. I can assure you that he has not softened in his passion for Intuitive or in the discipline of his thinking. We'll now open the line for questions. Operator, we are ready for questions now.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.
David Lewis – Morgan Stanley: Good morning – good afternoon, sorry.
Lonnie Smith: Hi, David.
Gary Guthart: Hi, David.
David Lewis – Morgan Stanley: Congratulations, Lonnie and Gary both on the transition. I guess you – first of all, may be for Gary or for Aleks, if you think about hysterectomy, given the growth rates that you are forecasting for '09 and forecasting into '10, is it time for us to start thinking about sort of a new way of thinking about the hysterectomy market size versus what you said historically? You projected to have procedures in hysterectomy that are going to be close to 100,000 or over 100,000, it seems that the market is proving to be dramatically larger than you would have said maybe 24 months ago. So may be you could give us your quick thoughts on that.
Aleks Cukic: Yes, I think – David, the way we think about it, if you recall when we put out our first sort of target market, we talked about 250,000 procedures. And again, the target was really based on where we knew we added the most value and that came out of the cohort of open procedures, open hysterectomies being converted. What you are seeing more and more is that a number of programs and practices have converted several of their laparoscopic procedures to da Vinci procedures and I think that's a trend that will continue. As far as, again, taking a number and saying the market opportunity is this size or that size, I think it's important to remind you that there is somewhere between 300,000 and perhaps 325,000 open hysterectomies and there are somewhere on the order of 250,000 either laparoscopic or vaginal hysterectomies. I think it's safe to say that our market opportunity is going to be larger than the 250,000, but I don't think we are in a position to tell you how large it could be.
David Lewis – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And just one quick follow-up here, maybe for Ben, since you talked about this in the past. But given the significant box placements in the fourth quarter, you still had revenue per procedure that was down year-over-year. Can you kind maybe just walk us through the dynamics there and how we should think about revenue per procedure heading into 2010? Have you troughed?
Ben Gong: I think if you take a look at it across larger time periods and sort of even out those quarterly fluctuations, you will see a gradual trend downward caused by two things. And the biggest thing is that stocking orders are becoming a less percentage of the total and as that happens, that will gradually bring down our revenue per procedure metric. And another thing that does happen on a gradual basis, although there is noise in the system, is that customers in general become more efficient over time as the procedure numbers grow. So I think Marshall mentioned that if you compare fourth quarter of last year to fourth quarter of this year, I think it was down by about 4% and that – that might be a sort of a – I know it's only a 1-point measurement, but it's more of a better comparison than saying – comparing two sequential quarters when you could have some more variations in a sequential rate. Does that answer your question? Hello? Operator?
Operator: It looks like David Lewis is no – David is no longer in the queue.
Gary Guthart: Okay.
Operator: Would you like to go on to the next question?
Gary Guthart: Sure.
Ben Gong: Sure.
Operator: Matthew O'Brien of William Blair, you may ask your question.
Matthew O'Brien – William Blair: Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. The procedure volume performance in the quarter was obviously very strong. Can you guys just talk a little bit about next two or three big opportunities that you are looking at and quantify that a little bit more for us?
Aleks Cukic: It – Matt, I think if you look at where our resources are going and where we are focused, they are really in the areas that we talk about and I don't think we are quick to run any victory laps on our completion with hysterectomy or even prostatectomy internationally or partial nephrectomy and cystectomy and so on and so forth. So outside of our target areas, I think you heard Gary mention a couple of procedure categories that we haven't really colored up a lot of and that being colorectal surgery and there was some discussion of thyroidectomy and so on. I would caution you to not run there too fast because there is a lot of opportunity both domestic and internationally in the procedures that you are used to talking to us about. And then we will resource the others appropriately, again, not abandoning the winners that we know we have in our hand right now.
Matthew O'Brien – William Blair: Can you just talk along those lines, Aleks, in terms of ENT, the size of that opportunity and when we can start to think about that coming online?
Aleks Cukic: Yes, I think – again, the ENT application is one that we believe has very high patient value, which has always been a great leading indicator for our ability to penetrate market. And so we are very encouraged by that. In terms of the raw numbers, again, based on the approvals we have today – and you have to remember, this is going to be our first foray into that vertical and what we've learned in the past is ultimately the long-term success goes beyond that first clearance. But that first clearance puts us in a position of about 10,000 or so, perhaps a little more, U.S. cases. But O-U.S., you are talking about a number north of 70,000 and some would estimate as high as a 100,000 or perhaps even higher. But we are in that one for the long term and we are very encouraged with the first clearance. I would ask you that – to sort of follow that for a while. We are not ready to make a lot of declarations there because we just received the clearance literally a month ago.
Matthew O'Brien – William Blair: Okay. And then one last one on Japan and I apologize, I know you guys aren’t providing too much in terms of guidance on that, but should we just think about that likely not being a 2010 event? I know you are selling there already a bit, but do you anticipate any hospitals just buying in front of what will likely be a reimbursement in 2011 or a bit later?
Gary Guthart: We are working on two things in parallel. We are working on clearing all the importation hurdles that will allow us to start placing systems and we think we will have an opportunity to place some. And then we are working on reimbursement and you know reimbursement is a complex pathway in Japan because we are a new medical device and they are a single-payer system. And that will likely occur procedure by procedure in the beginning. It won't be a blanket coverage, it will be a reimbursement for prostatectomy followed by something else. And that part, the reimbursement part, is a lot harder to penetrate in terms of what the timings will be and that will play out over time. So I think while reimbursement is at issue, I think that the penetration and systems will be measured.
Matthew O'Brien – William Blair: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tao Levy of Deutsche Bank.
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank: Good afternoon.
Gary Guthart: Good afternoon.
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank: A question on the guidance. You are providing obviously a lot more in terms of metrics than you did throughout 2009 and I was wondering if maybe you could comment on – what does that say about the environment into which you are selling and the confidence that you have now with whether it's the CapEx environment or procedures or anything that you are seeing?
Gary Guthart: Yes, Tao, it's Gary. I think there are a couple of things. I think that the visibility on our procedure business and the service business has been pretty reasonable. And we have learned that the utilization of systems will drive a certain amount of capital sales off the procedure business. So on that side, I think we have some visibility. The capital visibility is clearly better than it was a year ago, but it's still imperfect and highly variable, depending, I think, critically on a couple of factors. One of course is the macro environment and we saw kind of breath holding early in the year and then an exhale toward the end of the year and it's unclear to us whether that pattern is going to continue or settle out. At the same time, it's clear that procedure growth through this period has created some demand that requires response over time. So that's kind of how we got to where we are now.
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. And on the gross margin side, is there anything on the service part of it? The gross margins are a little bit lower than they had been in the past. Is it – is the uptake of the Si is a little bit trickier?
Ben Gong: Actually, service margins are fairly stable. What happens is we have expenses associated with training that go into that cost of goods sold line. And that in general brings down our overall gross margin on that line. I know you see it maybe somewhere close to let's say 60% or thereabouts on the P&L, but it's actually closer in reality to 70% on just the service business and what will make it fluctuate is sometimes the spending on training.
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank: And then just finally, I'd love to get your thoughts on what – what's the strategy at the Cleveland Clinic or on their – their purchase of five systems and were those trade-ins or upgrades? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.
Aleks Cukic: Yes. There was actually one system that came back as – in part of a trade-in and five that went to the Cleveland Clinic. Three of those five will be in the main campus at the Cleveland Clinic and two at a affiliate Cleveland Clinic hospital. So when you talk about the strategy, I think if you look across their specialties, there is very, very strong adoption in the cardiac side, the urology side, GYN is coming up and there are also a training center. So it is a – an excellent model for us in many ways. And so I think looking at where this could go, time will tell, but it's very integrated into a number of specialties in addition to training.
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank: All right. Thank you.
Gary Guthart: Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: Hey, good afternoon.
Marshall Mohr: Hi, Tycho.
Gary Guthart: Hi, Tycho.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: Maybe just – could you start by commenting on capital deployment strategies as we think about 2010? You've obviously got a tremendous cash flow and just talk about some of the priorities for the year ahead.
Marshall Mohr: So we have over – as we said, over a $1 billion of cash. We think that's a good thing. It provides us with the flexibility to do what we want to do going forward. You've seen us do purchases and licenses of IP where we think there is benefit in the long term. We will probably continue to do some of those. I recognize that those haven't been big to date. The only sizable expenditure this next year that we will undertake is – if you listened to Gary, he mentioned that we turned back on the construction of a facility next to our main campus. Other than that, we don't have any immediate plan.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe one for Aleks on cardio. Can you just talk a little bit more about the market dynamics there? I know you've talked in the past about a 120,000 target cases per year. Can you just talk about what – or how you think about uptake there?
Aleks Cukic: Yes, I think what is different about the cardiac space relative to let's say gynecology or urology is it's a slow, steady growth and it has been that way for a long time. Part of it is because of the anatomy that you are working on, the fact that it is a very serious cardiac operation and part of it is the fact that it's a pretty conservative group and there is also a longer training pathway. And the combination of those things has made it, let's say, a bit unique in the sense that you are not seeing hyper growth immediately like you've seen in some of our other categories. Now, having said that, the patient value of the centers that are performing it is excellent. The commitment from those centers is excellent. The demand for training is growing. And so I think it's perhaps going to be that way for a while, but we are still resourcing it and we still think there is a lot of patient value there. The mitral valve story is probably of the two stories between revascular and mitral valve. The mitral valve story is probably the one that is getting more of the headlines, but in the centers that are committed to revasc, they are very, very bullish on it. So there isn’t really a lot more in a way of commentary on that. I think it's steady as she goes and it's slow and steady growth.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: And then maybe a question just on broader utilization in the installed base. And maybe it’s not necessarily the right way to be thinking about it. Can you talk a little bit about where you think utilization could go a year from now and some of your efforts to try to work with physicians to improve scheduling and how much of a focus that is right now for hospitals?
Aleks Cukic: I'll start that answer and I think maybe Ben has some other – perhaps some quantitative support for it, but in terms of generally speaking, the answer to that really depends on the procedures. In other words, if all we were talking about theoretically was cardiac surgery, it would have one answer. If you add cardiac plus urology or prostatectomy specifically, the number expands. You add more procedures in the vertical of urology, it expands even further. You turn on gynecology, it expands further and so on and so forth. So in terms of how far that number could go really will depend on how far the penetration is and how much value we add in the various procedures. So it isn’t one that we necessarily point to and say we want to be at five, we are six cases per week by the end of the year or anything like that. But then in terms of scheduling, you can imagine that the more specialties that one is addressing, the potential for logjams, if you will, on capacity and getting on their systems goes up. But at the same time, we have more and more hospitals purchasing second and third systems. So those are sort of the facts and I don't know if Ben has anything else to add.
Ben Gong: Yes, I think Aleks describes the drivers. I mean, the numbers show that we have been gradually increasing that utilization. For the year in 2009, it was about 170 procedures per system per year. That's up from about 150 for 2008. And so that's an increase of, I think, about 13%. Q4 of 2009 was actually higher. I think we gave you enough numbers to where you can see us maybe closer to 175. So we think it's going to continue to gradually increase and again, driven by the 35% procedure growth that we forecasted.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: Okay. And then just one last one, Ben, on the trade-ins. Are we at kind of a run rate here of 20, 25 systems per – the next year or so? Or how do you think about that opportunity?
Ben Gong: Well, I've got two data points so far. I mean, as Aleks mentioned and Gary has mentioned, we certainly encourage the trade-ins of the Standards for da Vinci Si, because we think that Si platform is – it’s easier to use, it's – you can probably do more procedures on them. And so we encourage those transactions and we are not predicting how many we are going to have of those going forward. People have asked me how many are still left out there. It's still roughly 350 Standard systems out there, something like 230 of them in the United States.
Aleks Cukic: And I think it’s just really underlining that all this. These are – we'll do what the customers are looking for. I mean, we are not trying to really drive it and we are going to let the customer decide how they want to manage their inventory and we'll help them.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Rick Wise of Leerink Swann.
Rick Wise – Leerink Swann: Good afternoon, everybody. And Lonnie, let me offer my congratulations as well and I think it is worth noting that since this whole thing began there, it’s like here we are at over $1 billion of revenues and really congratulations on that amazing journey. Turning to a couple of specific questions. Can we talk about tax rate a little bit? Sort of two aspects. One, as we think about the year ahead, Ben, should we think about the tax rate starting higher at the beginning of the year and lower as you go through the year or averaging the 37%? And as we look out – obviously, you have to have multi-year models, you are not going to guide us, but should we assume that that tax rate can work gradually lower over time?
Marshall Mohr: So Rick, this is Marshall. The way the accounting rules work actually, we put into place a structure and you start reflecting that on day one. So there really won't be fluctuation in the rate during the year, barring changes in the law or the regulations. So when Ben quotes around 37% and that's what we are – that's where we should see throughout the year. As far as future, that's what we see for now, that's the structure we put into place. There are a lot of changes offered in Washington, so who knows what will happen. And so we are not predicting beyond this next year.
Rick Wise – Leerink Swann: Okay. The – but it's not an unreasonable notion that it's possible that tax rate could work higher over time, again, not trying to be so specific?
Marshall Mohr: Like I said, we aren’t predicting beyond this year.
Rick Wise – Leerink Swann: Okay. Guidance, can you give us any more color on the kind of growth rates you are assuming for da Vinci hysterectomy or dVP assumed in guidance, again, any kind of color there?
Marshall Mohr: Rick, at this time, we are not breaking it out. I mean, to grow overall a 35% obviously with hysterectomy going about 100% this past year and prostatectomy growing 23%, hysterectomy growth is going to have to be a significant part or driver of that ongoing growth rate to maintain it at 35%.
Rick Wise – Leerink Swann: Right. We saw on the operating leverage thought, we saw despite a complicated year, the costs associated with launching a major new system, we did see operating income grow faster than sales this year. A two-part question here, is it reasonable to think there is the opportunity for positive leverage in 2010 despite some of your commentary guidance, Ben? And maybe help us understand, Gary, your thinking on spending priorities and why you would – where you feel like you need to invest incrementally?
Gary Guthart: Yes, fair question. We have not been looking to drive really a lot of operating leverage because we think we are really in a market development stage of the business. We believe that strongly. And it's clear that our priorities are to be able to drive multiple procedure adoptions, both in different procedures and also in different geographies, both domestically and internationally. And so we are making investments to be able to do that in our sales force. We want to bring to markets new products, products that continue to drive patient value. We want to make those investments and you see us doing that as well. So we are – long story short, we are not trying to squeeze hard on the operating leverage there.
Rick Wise – Leerink Swann: Got you.
Ben Gong: The only – the only other thing I would sort of add is for the year, operating income grew 21% and revenues grew 20%. I know sometimes it's tempting to take a look at the fourth quarter. And the fourth quarter typically is a strong revenue quarter and then you see some operating leverage in that fourth quarter. But just be careful about that, you just might want to take a look at larger chunks of time rather than just one quarter.
Rick Wise – Leerink Swann: Of course. Just last quickly, somebody has got to ask about the cash and maybe just update us on your latest thinking about cash priorities, acquisition, technology, share buybacks, et cetera. Thank you.
Marshall Mohr: Yes, sure. So as I already mentioned, we've got over $1 billion of cash. We are comfortable with what we've got, it provides us flexibility to do things that we want to do. In the past, we've used it for acquisitions and licensing of IP, those aren’t big transactions. The only thing that’s on the table in this next year that's a little different is we are – restarted our construction of a facility next door. We don't have immediate – any immediate plans for share buybacks or dividends. However, we do still have the approval that was given to us, the remainder of the approval that was given to us earlier in the year for another $150 million buyback.
Rick Wise – Leerink Swann: Thanks so much.
Gary Guthart: Okay, we have time for two more questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Ricci of Wells Fargo.
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo: Hi guys. Gary, congratulations. So I guess the first question for you guys, you had 46,000 other procedures. Can you just tell us which – the – how – quantify how many of those were not in gynecology or urology?
Aleks Cukic: I don't have that number committed to memory, but I will say that a fair amount of them as you – I think the way you phrased the question, you could expect that a lot of those came out of that vertical. I would say the cardiac and the general surgery procedures for the most part make up the remainder and there is some – although under in IRB, there were some ENT procedures in there as well.
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo: Okay, great. And in terms of the two verticals that we did kind of focus on, I mean, I have the AUA advanced program right in front of me. You guys have two live surgery programs going on. I mean, it's – are there other applications the size of the ones that you guys have talked about or is it strictly the two kind of – besides radical prostatectomy, you've also got cystectomy and nephrectomy. Is that kind of where we are still concentrating with that?
Aleks Cukic: Well, think about it this way, maybe perhaps a little bit – a little broader. And that is the urologic oncology, I mean, the predominant culprits of urologic oncology are the prostate, the kidney, and the bladder. So you can say that we are squarely involved in all three of those. On the benign side, you are looking at the reconstructive procedures, i.e., the pyeloplasties and we are squarely involved in that. And so there are other areas in perhaps benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH and we are really not involved in that. But I think it's fair to say that da Vinci's role within the AUA is pretty large already, perhaps can get larger, but pretty large.
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo: Okay, great. And then in terms of IP, you guys have clearly – you guys clearly did go on a bit of a spend for a while getting IP, it kind of seemed to settled down. Is there things out there – I know you guys case a lot of patents and a lot of projects that are out there, are there things out there that you think you need to acquire rather than develop internally in terms of intellectual property?
Gary Guthart: This is a general answer to that question. I think the answer to that is always yes. I think that there is IP that we develop internally and there is frequently IP we see out in the world that we think is – fits well with us both for patents and the technology. And so we are – we have a consistent process to look at both of them. It's lumpy, it's not the kind of the thing that happens at an even pace quarterly [ph]. You sort of pursue it as you get it. I think we have time for just one more question.
Operator: Our last question comes from Sameer Harish of Needham & Company.
Sameer Harish – Needham & Company: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and Lonnie, congratulations on 13 great years. I wanted to ask about physician training. Can you talk to me a little bit about mix in physician training? Is it mimicking what you are seeing on the procedure growth side and do you get good visibility on what procedure growth would look like from that training?
Aleks Cukic: I would say in general, the answer is probably yes to both. In other words, you can imagine that the number of surgeons being trained in hysterectomy is going to be larger in terms of raw numbers than the – than prostatectomy at this stage. We've done a lot of training in prostatectomy and then the – after a certain point, the specialty starts to take over some of those responsibility – in other words, one partner trains another or one leader trains another person or it gets integrated deeper into the academic medical centers. So we become more focused on driving the procedures that we are focused on. And from that, you can tell certainly what the demand for training is and hopefully that is a direct relationship to the procedure growth.
Sameer Harish – Needham & Company: Okay. And as you gain experience in prostate and hysterectomy and expanding that into new areas, can you talk a little bit about the lag between what you are seeing now on some of the emerging procedures and when you would expect to see some of those begin to really get adopted?
Aleks Cukic: That's a harder question to answer. I mean, I think if you look at new procedures, let's say, that are outside of the specialty of gynecology and urology, you are talking about really early stages. For example, we just received ENT approval. And so you are going to have to give us some time to really understand the demand curve for training and the procedures and so on. It's too early to guess and that's really what you are doing. And in some of the other procedures, you – be it colorectal or some of the others, you are missing some key elements of the product line and some of those will be coming on and it's too early to really extrapolate that on what it might mean.
Sameer Harish – Needham & Company: Okay. Switching gears to the system side, you guys have talked in the past about integrating imaging using contrast and shape-sensing technologies. Can you give us an update on where those are in development and as you roll those out, would those require system changes or are they more plug-and-play?
Gary Guthart: As you know, we don't give specific timing of products coming in development. But I – what I’d tell you is we have products across the range there. We have things that will look like upgrades to existing products and we have some things that are more significant than upgrading and those things will roll out in time. I think that was our last question. As we've discussed with you over the years, while we spend our time on these calls reviewing our financial performance, our team remains sharply focused on the creation of patient value, improving the efficacy of surgery while reducing its invasiveness. I would like to share with you two of the many examples we receive daily of what this means in the lives of our patients. Our first patient is Mr. Dale Gayan, a patient of Dr. Brian Golden at – of Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Nevada. Quote, "This is my note to – my thanks to Dr. Golden for saving most of my left kidney. My story is a little unusual, since I had already lost my right kidney to cancer in 2002. That whole kidney was removed in a traditional operation through a long "shark bite" that was awfully painful and took several months to recover from. Recently my doctor found the new tumor in my left kidney, the only one I have left. I was scared I would need this kidney removed, then be hooked up to dialysis for the rest of my life. The urologist who took out my right kidney years ago recommended Dr. Brian Golden. My primary doctor rated Dr. Golden as "excellent" which, of course, influenced my decision, but the deciding moments were when I actually met and discussed my case with Dr. G. He showed me my CAT scan and the tumor. He described the operation using the da Vinci robot, robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy, and showed me how much of my kidney could be saved. He had a very reassuring bedside manner, was confident but not arrogant, and answered all of my questions. He made me feel comfortable that I had found the right surgeon for my terrifying situation. The surgery went great. My kidney was working just as well after surgery as beforehand. The few little incisions weren't very painful and I was out of the hospital in just a day and a half. When I saw Dr. Golden after surgery, he said the pathology report said all the cancer was removed. My primary care doctor was absolutely amazed at my speedy recovery and the difference in my incisions for the right and left kidney operations," end quote. Another patient suffered from oral cancer and is a patient of Dr. Bert O'Malley of University of Pennsylvania, who with his partner Dr. Greg Weinstein, is a leader in the creation of TransOral da Vinci surgery. This patient writes, quote, "Dr. O'Malley, you have brought a miraculous change in my life. I now can swallow normally, do not have to force-feed my medications, do not need oxygen at night and feel like a new way of life has opened for me. How can I ever repay your kindness and skill for making this possible? I never can. So I'll simply say, God bless you for your kindness and help and changing my entire outlook," end quote. Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-10-21 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Benjamin Gong – Vice President of Finance Lonnie M. Smith – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Gary S. Guthart – President and Chief Operating Officer Marshall L. Mohr – Chief Financial Officer Aleks Cukic – Vice President, Strategic Planning 
Analysts: James Francis – Morgan Stanley Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Unidentified Analyst Sameer Harish – Needham & Company Sean Lavin – Lazard Capital Markets Vincent Ricci – Wachovia
Operator: Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time all participants are on a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). Now I would like to turn today's call over to Mr. Ben Gong, Vice President of Finance. 
Benjamin Gong: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's third quarter conference call. With me today we have Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO; Gary Guthart, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at www.intuitivesurgical.com on the audio archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. First, Lonnie will present the quarter's business highlights. Gary will follow with operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights, and then I'll provide an update on our financial forecast for 2009 and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'd like to introduce Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO.
Lonnie M. Smith: Thank you for joining us today. Despite the challenging and uncertain economic environment, patients, surgeons, and hospitals continue to recognize the value our products bring to surgery and surgical outcomes. Before reviewing our operating highlights for the third quarter, I’d like to remind you that we took a $20 million revenue deferral in the first quarter associated with our offer to customers who purchased the Da Vinci S system in the first quarter to upgrade to the new SI system. We recognized the remaining $6 million of that $20 million deferral this past quarter. I excluded the impact of the revenue deferral and reversal in my summaries of our first and second quarter financial performance, and will exclude the $6 million reversal in my summary of our third quarter performance. With that background, operating highlights for the third quarter were as follows. Procedures grew approximately 49% over the third quarter of 2008. We sold 86 da Vinci surgical systems, down from 71 sold during the third quarter of last year. Fourteen of 86 systems were sold to international customers. We ended the third quarter with 1308 da Vinci systems installed worldwide. Total revenue grew to $274 million, up 16% from last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to 101 million, up 33%. Total recurring revenue grew to $144 million, up 31% from the prior year, comprising 53% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $123 million before non-cash stock option expense, up 16% from the third quarter of last year, and we ended the quarter with $1024 million in cash and investments, up $122 million from last quarter and up $203 million from this time last year after spending $150 million to repurchase stock earlier this year. With that, I’ll pass the time over to Gary S. Guthart, our President and Chief Operating Officer.
Gary S. Guthart:  As a whole, Q3 has been a productive quarter for our organization with strong progress across a wide variety of activities. In the quarter, we generated $106 million in gross cash from operations which is 165% of our reported GAAP net income and $2.71 per fully diluted share as compared with GAAP net income of $1.64 per fully diluted share. Our significant cash outlays during the quarter totaled $5 million invested in property, plant, and equipment, and we benefited from $1 million change in working capital. In addition, we grew our global ISI team by 64 members in Q3 bringing our total employee count to 1188. We have seen steady adoption of our SI system in regions in which it is approved, representing 81% of sales in these markets. The introduction of the SI has also catalyzed trade-in transactions for Da Vinci’s standard systems. Architectural improvements in the S and SI have led to procedure throughput increases on these platforms relative to the standard, and with the standard now at two generations behind current products, customers have been motivated to replace standard systems with SI units.  We continue to invest in manufacturing efficiencies with regard to our SI systems and are realizing improving SI system margins. Second consoles were included in 16% of SI sales, and early reports of training efficacy with SI second consoles are encouraging. Several of our customers are evaluating training pathways using the dual console with an eye towards analysis of efficiency and efficacy of training. Our development teams continue to make progress across several fronts. In new instrumentation, we’re investing in robotic stapling and multi-function energy delivery instruments and in other instruments and accessories that facilitate teachable and repeatable procedures. We are currently piloting training technologies including distance mentoring using the internet as well as surgical simulation for Da Vinci as a way to shorten learning curves and standardize training pathways.  With respect to imaging, we’re working closely with our technology partners to bring to market real-time contrast based imaging capabilities to supplement the 3-D view. These imaging technologies will allow surgeons to highlight anatomic areas of interest within the console endoscopic view. Lastly, our teams are making progress in researching and commercializing mechanisms that will allow for single port robotic surgery. We’re in discussion with regulatory agencies worldwide seeking approvals for new products and new indications for our Da Vinci system. We’ve seen some positive steps regarding approval in Japan, but we have much yet to accomplish before full commercialization can begin, including granting of approval and import licenses and establishing the payment pathway for relevant procedures. We believe Japan will be an important market for ISI in the medium and long-term and are therefore focused on the successful first approval and import licensing following by building well-trained and successful robotic programs with our early customers. With that, I’ll turn the time over to Marshall for our financial review. 
Marshall L. Mohr : As previously announced, we offered certain first quarter customers the opportunity to upgrade their Da Vinci S systems to Da Vinci SI systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. As a result, we deferred a total of $20.1 million of revenue in the first quarter comprised of $18 million os system revenue associated with system upgrade offers and $2.1 million of accessory revenue. In our second quarter, we recognized $13.8 million of the total $20.1 million originally deferred. In our third quarter, we recognized the remaining the first quarter deferred revenue of $6.3 million, as we completed the 13 remaining upgrades in the third quarter.  To provide listeners with comparable information, I will now walk you through our revenue results excluding the deferrals. Our third quarter revenue was $274 million, up 16% compared with $236 million for the third quarter 2008, and up 11% compared with $247 million for the second quarter of 2009. Quarter to quarter, revenue and procedure growth reflected a seasonal slowdown particularly outside the US.  Third quarter revenues by product category are as follows: Third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $100 million, up 32% compared with $76 million for the third quarter of 2008 and up 6% compared with $94 million in the second quarter of 2009. The increase compared with the prior quarters is driven by procedure growth; specifically procedures have increased 49% compared to the third quarter of 2008. Also impacting instrument and accessory growth are both the number of initial stocking orders and the lower impact that initial stocking orders have on a higher base of instrument and accessory usage.  The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1920 per procedure, down approximately $250 per procedure compared to last year and up approximately $30 per procedure compared to the second quarter. The decline in revenue per procedure compared to the third quarter of 2008 reflects the lower impact that initial stocking orders have on an increased installed base and customer efficiency. The increase from last quarter reflects increased initial stocking orders.  Third quarter 2009 systems revenue of $130 million was $4 million higher than the $126 million of systems revenue for the third quarter of 2008 and $19 million higher than the $111 million of systems revenue for the second quarter. Despite the increase in systems revenue, we continue to feel the impact of curtailed hospital spending for capital equipment in the ongoing economic recession. We sold 86 systems during the third quarter of 2009, compared with 91 systems last year and 76 systems last quarter. Seventy-two systems were sold in the US during the quarter, compared with 71 systems last year and 56 systems in the last quarter. Fourteen systems were sold outside the US, compared with 20 last quarter and 20 last year. Seventy of the 86, or 81% of the units sold in the quarter, were Da Vinci SI systems. Twenty of the systems sold in the quarter involved trade-ins of Da Vinci standard systems, compared to 5 in the third quarter of 2008 and 5 last quarter. We’ve encouraged trade-ins as we believe that the SI system provides clinical and user benefits over Da Vinci standard and increased system usage. Third quarter system revenue also included $10 million of upgrade revenue compared to $1 million in the third quarter of 2008 and $2 million in the second quarter of 2009. $3 million of the upgrade revenue represented the incremental revenue on the 13 first quarter upgrade offers completed in the third quarter. The remainder of the upgrade revenue was primarily associated with 10 Da Vinci SI upgrades sold and installed in the quarter. Our third quarter average sales price per system including all Da Vinci models but excluding upgrades and the revenue deferral was $1,390,000, a decrease from $1,430,000 realized in the second quarter and an increase from the $1,370,000 realized in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease from the second quarter reflects credits provided to customers on the 20 trade-in transactions and the lower mix of European direct sales.  Service revenue increased to $44 million, up 30%, compared with $34 million last year and up 6% compared with $41 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total third quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory, and service revenue increased to $144 million, up 31% compared with the third quarter of 2008 and up 6% compared with the second quarter of 2009. Recurring revenue represented 53% of total third quarter revenue compared with 46% in the third quarter of last year and 55% last quarter. Moving on to gross margins, there were no costs deferred in conjunction with the $20.1 million revenue deferral, and therefore all of the $20.1 million first quarter deferral, all of the $13.8 million second quarter recognition, and all of the $6.3 million third quarter recognition had an equal impact on revenue, gross profit, operating income, and pretax income. Excluding the impact of the deferral activities, gross margin in the third quarter was 70.4%, compared with third quarter 2008 gross margin of 71.9% and second quarter 2009 gross margin of 71.5%. The decrease in gross margin reflects inventory reserves recorded to write down certain Da Vinci standard inventory as well as lower system ASPs.  Third quarter operating expenses of $95 million were up 12% compared with the third quarter of 2008 and up 4% compared with the second quarter. The quarter over quarter increase reflects commissions associated with higher revenue, costs associated with 64 employees added during the quarter, and increased R&D costs. In addition, patent amortization expenses increased to $3.6 million for the quarter, compared with $2.5 million during the third quarter of 2008 and $3.8 million last quarter.  Excluding the impact of deferral activities, third quarter 2009 operating income was $98 million or 36% of sales, compared with $85 million or 36% of sales for the third quarter of 2008 and $86 million or 35% of sales for the second quarter of 2009. Third quarter2009 operating income reflected $25 million of non-cash compensation expense compared with $21 million for the third quarter of 2008 and $25 million last quarter. Our third quarter 2009 other income of $4.4 million was approximately the same as the third quarter of 2008 and approximately $800,000 less than the second quarter of 2009. The sequential quarter decrease primarily reflects lower interest due to declining interest rates on investments.  Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 40.7% was slightly higher than our anticipated rate of 40% due to higher state tax rates. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2008 was 35.7% reflecting R&D credits recorded in the third quarter of 2008 relating to our 2007 tax return.  Our net income was $65 million or $1.64 per share, compared with $58 million or $1.44 per share for the third quarter of 2008 and $62 million or $1.62 per share for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of deferral activities, third quarter net income was $61 million or $1.55 per share, compared with $58 million or $1.44 for the third quarter of 2008 and $54 million or $1.40 per share last quarter.  Let me quickly summarize our results for the first nine months of 2009, and I’d like to point out that since all of the upgrades associated with Q1 offers were completed by September 30, 2009, the two periods are comparable. Procedures grew by 53% for the first 9 months of 2009 compared to 2008. Total revenue for the first nine months of 2009 was $729 million, up 13% compared with $643 million last year. This included recurring revenue growth of 33% and a decrease in systems revenue of 4%. The decrease in systems revenue reflects the impact of curtailed hospital spending for capital equipment. Operating income for the first 9 months of 2009 was $249 million, up 9%, compared with $228 million last year. Operating income included $72 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first 9 months of 2009 compared with $55 million in 2008. Net income for the first nine months of 2009 is $155 million or $3.97 per share, compared with $154 million or $3.84 per share last year. Now moving to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter of 2009 with cash and investments of $1024 million, up $122 million from both June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, amounts. The increase during the quarter reflects cash flow from operations and $22 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $5 million of capital expenditures. Since December 31, 2009, cash flow from operations of $269 million and stock option exercises of $34 million was partially offset by IP purchases and capital expenditures of $46 million and the $150 million used to buy back and retire 1.4 million shares of common stock. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $187 million at September 30, 2009, from $175 million at June 30, 2009. The increase in receivables reflects increased revenue. Our net inventory decreased to $57 million at September 30, 2009, from $59 million at June 30, 2009. Despite growth in revenues, our inventory declined during the third quarter, primarily due to the utilization of material built up to support the Da Vinci SI product launch. With that, I’d like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing, and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: During the third quarter, we sold 86 Da Vinci systems—72 in the US, 8 in Europe, and 6 into rest of world markets. We traded in 20 standard Da Vinci systems during the quarter. The net 66 additions to the installed based brings to 1308 the cumulative number of Da Vinci systems worldwide; 968 in the US, 229 in Europe, and 111 in rest of world markets. 37 of the 86 installed systems represented repeat system sales to existing customers which included a sixth system to Methodist Medical Center in Houston, a fifth system to Ohio State University Medical Center, a fourth system to Memorial Herman in Houston, and third systems to USC Medical Center, Johns Hopkins, and Baptist South Florida. Internationally, we placed three more Da Vinci systems into Germany.  Clinically, we had another strong quarter, in what is traditionally a slower procedure quarter. We had excellent sequential growth within several of our targeted procedures. Demand for Da Vinci hysterectomy, both for benign and malignant conditions, continues to lead the way. Also showing strong sequential growth were sacro-colpopexies, myomectomy, partial nephrectomy, thyroidectomy, and Da Vinci low rectal resections. In Q3, over 300 Da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts were published within peer-reviewed journals—90 within the GYN specialty alone, which speaks volumes when you consider that for all of 2008 there were a total of 50 GYN publications. In the traditionally slower third quarter, our participation within the various domestic and international medical conferences was abundant, and Q4 is off to a rapid start. During previous calls, I’ve highlighted the growing volume of literature that discusses the benefits of DVH for treatment of endometrial cancer, and this quarter, I will highlight Da Vinci’s growing role within cervical cancer. The results of a multicenter study examining the perioperative results of DVH for treating early stage cervical cancer was published in the journal Gynecologic Oncology.  The study emanated out of Northwestern University, The University of Tennessee, Chattanooga; the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; and the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center in Memphis. Five GYN oncologists who at the time of their publication had documented the results under an IRB of 835 DVH procedures. From this set of patients, they identified 42 women who required type 2 radical hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer. Ten of these patients had undergone a type 2 radical DVH, and 32 had undergone a type 3 radical DVH procedure. The results were impressive. The overall average blood loss was only 50 cc. Not a single patient received a blood transfusion. The medium lymph node yield was 25. The average operating time was 250 minutes, with only one patient being converted to a laparotomy. The average hospitalization for these complex radical hysterectomies was 1 day. The authors’ conclusion and I quote “robotic radical hysterectomy is associated with minimal blood loss, a shortened hospital stay, and few operative complications. Operative time and lymph node yields are acceptable. This data suggests that robotic radical hysterectomy may offer an alternative to traditional radical hysterectomy.”  As you know, our greatest market opportunity resides within the benign GYN patient segment, and last quarter the Journal of Robotic Surgery reported a collective series from a GYN group at Rochester General Hospital in Rochester, New York. The study is entitled Robotic Assisted Gynecologic Surgery in a Community Setting. The authors reviewed the outcomes of 110 GYN procedures. 74 patients underwent a DVH with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, 18 Da Vinci sacro-colpopexies, 15 da Vinci myomectomies, and 3 da Vinci oophorectomies. The patient group studies had undergone procedures between June 2005 and April 2008. All of the procedures were completed robotically without the need to convert to an open approach. The average procedure time was 135 minutes, with an average blood loss of 160 cc.  There was only one intraoperative complication which was repaired robotically, and the mean hospital stay was 1 day, with over half of the patients being discharged within a 24-hour time period. Postoperative pain levels ranged from 0 to 6 on a 10-point scale and was relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The overall complication rate for their hysterectomy patients including intraoperatively and postoperatively was 7%, which is very low when compared to the reported 26% and 22% complication rate for abdominal and laparoscopic hysterectomy respectively.  In their conclusions, the authors wrote and I quote, “Robotic assisted laparoscopy for benign surgical procedures are feasible techniques in a community setting. Robotic assisted laparoscopy has a promising future in minimally invasive surgery as it has proved beneficial for our patients who experience low complication rates and overall fast recovery when compared to other approaches.”  Da Vinci partial nephrectomy is rapidly emerging as an alternative to both open partial nephrectomy and laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. The largest multicenter experience to date comparing 129 consecutive Da Vinci partial nephrectomies to 118 consecutive laparoscopic partial nephrectomies was recently published in the Journal of Urology. The study represented the experiences from Washington University in St. Louis, the Vattikuti Institute at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, and NYU Medical Center. Comparison of the operative data revealed no significant differences in the overall operative time, collecting system entry, pathologic tumor size, and positive margin rates between the two cohorts. Intraoperative blood loss was less in the robotic cohort, as was the length of the hospital stay, but most importantly, warm ischemic times were significantly shorter in the Da Vinci series—19.7 minutes versus 28.4 minutes. Subset analysis based on complexity revealed that tumor complexity had no effect on operative time or estimated blood loss in the Da Vinci series, although complexity did affect these factors in the laparoscopic partial nephrectomies. There were no intraoperative complications in the Da Vinci group compared to one intraoperative complication in the laparoscopy group.  The authors concluded by saying and I quote, “Robotic assisted partial nephrectomy is a safe and viable alternative to laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, providing early equivalent oncologic outcomes and comparable morbidity to traditional laparoscopic approach. Moreover, robotic assisted partial nephrectomy appears to offer decreased hospitalization as well as significantly less intraoperative blood loss and shorter warm ischemic time, the latter which may help to provide maximum preservation of renal reserve. In addition, operative parameters for robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy appeared to be less effected by tumor complexity compared to laparoscopic nephrectomy. Interestingly, while the advantages of robotic surgery have historically believed to aid laparoscopic naïve surgeon, these data indicate that robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy may also benefit experienced laparoscope surgeons.” Last week, JAMA published a study entitled Comparative Effectiveness of Minimally Invasive Prostatectomy Versus Open Radical Prostatectomy which claimed that minimally invasive radical prostatectomy was associated with higher rates of incontinence and erectile dysfunction than open radical prostatectomy. While we don’t take issue with the study’s data, it’s easy to question the study’s design, written conclusions, and the media’s interpretation of these conclusions. To summarize, the study evaluated the results of 3 distinct surgical techniques—traditional laparoscopic prostatectomy which has a history of higher rates of incontinence and erectile dysfunction, robotic prostatectomy, and open retropubic prostatectomy between the years 2003 and the first part of 2006. Here is the challenge: Without differentiating between lap and robotic techniques, the study blended them into a single minimally invasive radical prostatectomy cohort and reported it as such. There was no way to determine the ratio between laparoscopic and robotic cases since at the time in question CPT code 55866 incorporated both lap and robotic techniques. Moreover, there was no baseline established for the patients’ pre or postoperative condition using any validated quality of life instrument since all the information was extracted from CPT data. When you consider the facts associated with the study, it is perplexing that someone could conclude that DVP was associated with more incontinence and erectile dysfunction than open prostatectomy. Be that as it may, I suspect that the greater urologic community has recognized the inconsistencies and faults between the study design and its conclusion, but it is the patient in our opinion that has been done a great disservice by the media’s portrayal of this inconclusive JAMA report.  In any given quarter, peer-reviewed urological journals address this very topic, and last quarter was no different. In the British journal of urology, Dr. Vincenzo Ficarra and his team from the Department of Oncologic and Surgical Sciences at the University of Padova in Padova, Italy, published their results from a prospective nonrandomized trial comparing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy to retropubic radical prostatectomy. The study enrolled 208 men; 105 received an open retopubic radical prostatectomy, and 103 received da Vinci prostatectomy. When comparing blood loss and blood transfusions between the two cohorts, the da Vinci group experienced 40% less blood loss and 86% fewer transfusions than the open route. Complications and positive surgical margins were similar, but the most significant difference between the two groups was in the area of postsurgical incontinence and erectile function. For urinary continence, 41% of the open patients and 68% of the da Vinci patients were continent at catheter removal. The 12-month continence rates were 88% for open patients and 97% for the da Vinci group with a mean time to continence being 75 and 25 days respectively. At the 12-month followup, 49% of the men having a bilateral nerve sparing open procedure and 81% of the men having a da Vinci bilateral nerve-sparing procedure had recovery of erectile function. The conclusion and I quote, “robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy offers better results than retropubic radical prostatectomy in terms of urinary incontinence and erectile function recovery with similar possible surgical margins.”  That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the time over to Ben.
Benjamin Gong: I’ll be providing an update on our forecast for 2009 based on our results in Q3. Consistent with the previous two quarters, I’ll provide a forecast for procedure growth, but will not be providing specific guidance on system or total revenues. Procedures were strong in the third quarter, despite the seasonal slowdown we see every summer particularly in Europe. Procedures grew approximately 49% in the third quarter compared to last year. In our last earnings call, we forecasted procedures to grow more than 45% for the year. Given our current run rate, we should exceed 200,000 procedures for the year; that’s more than 47% higher than the 136,000 procedures we completed last year. This continues to drive significant growth in our total instrument and accessories revenue this year. However, as we have mentioned in our previous calls, variations in initial stocking orders and customer ordering patterns can cause our instrument and accessory revenues to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. In the longer term, instrument and accessory revenue growth should more closely match our growth and procedures.  Our service revenue model has been very consistent, and we expect it to remain as it has in the past. We’re generating an average of about $140,000 in service revenue per system per year. With regard to gross margin, we have been consistently at about 71% over the past two years. While margin could fluctuate quarter to quarter due to product and geography mix, we expect it to remain at about 71%. Moving to operating expense, we are reiterating a forecast of growing our GAAP operating expense by approximately 19% in 2009. We are continuing to move higher resources in the field to drive procedure growth in the near-term, and we're continuing to invest new and existing R&D projects to drive growth in our long-term business. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, has been decreasing slightly due to lower interest rates on our cash investments. We expect other income to remain at approximately $4 million for the fourth quarter. With regard to income tax, we have recorded a tax rate of 41% year to date, and it is likely to remain at approximately this rate for 2009. We are working on setting up processes that would allow us to start reporting a lower tax rate sometime in 2010. Our share count for calculating EPS increased from Q2 to Q3 by approximately 700,000 shares, primarily due to the recent increase in our stock price. We ended the quarter with approximately 38.2 million shares outstanding, and approximately 1,000,000 shares were added to the diluted share count for calculating Q3 EPS. For the fourth quarter, we expect our share count for calculating EPS to be between 39.5 and 39.8 million shares. Finally regarding our cash flows, we continue to generate significantly more cash than our reported net income. We generated $96 million cash from operations in Q3, compared with net income of $65 million. Year-to-date, we generated $269 million in cash flow from operations compared with our reported net income of $155 million over the same period. The largest contributor to this difference was a recording of approximately $72 million of non-cash stock compensation expense year-to-date, and as we mentioned last time, we expect to record another $25 million in the fourth quarter. As a result, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of James Francis with Morgan Stanley.
James Francis – Morgan Stanley:  It looks like the OUS results that you had were the weakest that we have seen in some time. What else can you tell us about the source of this sequential decline from Q2? Is there a specific country where orders did not materialize or are you seeing some seasonality in EU? Is the CapEx spending cycle bottoming out OUS maybe with a lag from the US cycle?
Lonnie M. Smith: James, I think a little of everything you said has probably affected our Q3 numbers. First off, Q3 is historically a slow quarter in Europe. There are a lot of vacations both from a patient’s side, although our procedures remain strong, just putting deals together is always more challenging, but I think on top of that, without question, there is some recessionary activity being felt in Europe, and I don't think it's the same in any country as evidenced by Germany having three systems for example this quarter while other countries did not contribute, so I think we really attribute it to nothing really structural other than some forces that work against us OUS in Q3. 
James Francis – Morgan Stanley:  Getting back to the JAMA study, if you think about the clinical data published on Da Vinci, it’s not been sponsored by the company and much of it tends to evaluate the single center experience. After the JAMA study came out last week, how much sense does it make for Intuitive to sponsor clinical work, particularly larger, more multi-center trials that can demonstrate the real value of technology?
Lonnie M. Smith: Our position has always been that the data will come, and it'll probably come in forms that people become accustomed to, meaning multi-centered trials and surgeons working together to put together multi-centered trials. In fact, we're seeing some of that and you saw some of that, and actually I referenced it in the GYN oncology site. One of the challenges of rapid multi-centered trial is going to be the source of information. For example, you could do a retrospective analysis and observational study using CPT codes, but the medical community doesn’t really look at that as really good solid evidence-based medicine, and so I think what you're asking for will happen, and perhaps there are some things we can do to help it, but I think it has always been our belief and remains our belief that staying out of good clinical evidence is probably not a bad position for us to take.
James Francis – Morgan Stanley:  On the hysterectomy market, you mentioned that you have been seeing doctors that sometimes may start out doing their more complex cases on the robot and then gravitate towards using robot exclusively. Are you starting to think that maybe the initial market that you identified for hysterectomy, that is the 250,000 oncology and complex benign, might really be bigger or could it be closer to all practicing GYNs or operating GYNs? 
Lonnie M. Smith:  I think the way we have really looked at that and the way we have sized it is, you have heard us not waver our position where we talk about the surgeon value equation, and we know that the highest surgeon value equation that we can help contribute comes from those very complex cases, and that's where we are going to start. Does that mean that we can’t get to all of the hysterectomies? You know it really doesn't. There are non-complex cases that people have gravitated with Da Vinci, and I think that's great, but we feel very strongly about the patient value of that. They contribute to the open hysterectomies when we can convert them to minimally invasive, and we’ll see where it goes. It may turn out that we were wrong, and the market can be significantly larger, but I think it's early for us to say that.
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank Securities: On the upgrades that happened in the quarter, the 20 systems, can you maybe walk through the benefits for Intuitive of a hospital converting from a standard to an SI? Maybe you can walk us through the different segments within your P&L, the benefit on the system side, any impact on disposables, service, how do those metrics change?
Lonnie Smith : As Gary mentioned with the announcement of SI, those old standards are now two generations behind, and there is a dramatic difference between the first system that we came out with standard to the SI, and the ease of use is dramatically different in terms of changeover, the whole feature set, and what we have seen is as we track procedures for system, even going from standards to S’s, we see that S’s are more heavily used than standards, and we believe SI will follow that pattern, and so then as I look at it, I assume replacement market. US domestic, I assumed about an eight-year life, and that after 8 years those things will start to be turned in, and I think that is not far off. It is a little longer for international, and so we clearly would like to get, and hospitals want to standardize too, because they want to buy a second system, and so when they buy the second system, they prefer to have one consistent with the other so that surgeons can move from one to the other because the interface is a bit different, so in my personal view and I think our view as an organization is that this is a good thing for us and a good thing for the hospitals as they move to a more capable, easier to use system that is consistent from one OR to the next in terms of the metrics, in terms of disposables, or accessories. I don't think there is a lot of difference, but I’ll let Ben answer that.
Benjamin Gong: On a recurring revenue basis, on the instruments and accessories, they are very similar—the standard system and an SI—but as Lonnie mentioned, on average we think we are getting higher utilization in general on the newer technology than the other ones. There's a small increase in the service revenue on the SI’s versus the standard, so we are going to benefit from that, but it's not terribly a large amount, but it is beneficial.
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank Securities:  On Japan, is there anything else that you can tell us in terms of the next steps that you're waiting for before final approval, and also what is the process for import licensing that you're waiting for after approval?
Gary Guthart: We need a few things. We need to receive the Shonan which we think is in process, but has not been done yet. Then there are import license restrictions that you have to clear, so you have to get an import license. There are some supplier audits and other internal things that have to be completed before you can ship into the country, and then we are working on what the payment pathways are for various procedures, so those are really the big chunks that have to be done. 
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank Securities:  How long is the import part?
Gary Guthart: I am not really able to give you an exact timeline in each of these steps. They are in months. 
Tao Levy – Deutsche Bank Securities:  Historically, when the dollar has been weak, Ben, is there any correlation with increases in international sales because theoretically you're getting a system for a little bit cheaper if you’re paying in foreign currencies?
Benjamin Gong: Remember when we are selling direct into Europe, we’re selling in the local currency, so from the customer’s standpoint, they may not see that much difference, but it's true when we're selling to distributors. We do sell in dollars, so it could help in some way with the distributors perhaps being more able to sell systems at a different price.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.
Tycho Peterson – J.P. Morgan:  Following up on the last questions on Japan, I understand that there are a lot of uncertainties in the near-term on the timelines. Can you just give us a sense longer term how you are thinking about the market opportunity? Is there any potential mix shift here? Would it be larger for dual console versus the US opportunity and also how you are thinking about pricing? Obviously, they tend to reimburse fewer devices but typically at a higher level, so how you’re thinking about the ASP opportunity over there? 
Gary Guthart:
 :
Benjamin Gong: As Gary mentioned, it is Da Vinci S that we’re slated to get approval on, so you might want to think in terms of that. The historical pricing that we have been getting on S is probably what we are going to be getting over there. The second part had to do with the market size?
Gary S. Guthart: Segmentation, and I think the way we are thinking about segmentation, again based on the earlier comments, there is not going to be a lot of system segmentation, but the procedures that you look at when you look at the Japanese market perhaps are a bit different than you’re used to seeing in the US. It has to do probably with more GI surgery including gastric cancers and a high esophageal and colorectal cancers, and probably fewer prostatectomies on a per capita basis since prostate cancer does not affect Asian men at the same level as it does Europeans and Americans, so it will be interesting to see how that all unfolds because it is going to be a little different than the United States market or the European market in terms of those patient targets. We think collectively it represents a big opportunity, and we will see how it unfolds and how we segment our resources.
Benjamin Gong: One thing I didn’t mention is we do plan on selling through a distributor in Japan, so again the pricing that we’ll be getting is going to be consistent with the distribution pricing that we’ve had in other places.
 :
Tycho Peterson – J.P. Morgan:  On the R&D priorities, I think, Gary, in your comments you talked a little about real-time imaging capabilities. I’m just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on that. Is there an effort to bring on more of a consumable stream into the mix with imaging agents, and then can you also just talk about some of the initiatives to move up and down the value chain? I think you talked about some hand-held instruments with the SurgiQuest deal earlier this year. I was just wondering if you could update on some of those partnerships.  
Gary Guthart:  On the imaging side, we don’t think there will be a substantial change in terms of the consumable mix with regard to imaging. We think it will give us better clinical outcomes by allowing surgeons to see through tissue planes that they can’t otherwise see through, things like vasculature, lymphatics, things like that, so it really is a value-add relative to the instrumentation that’s there already. With regard to SurgiQuest, we’re not getting into hand-held instrumentation. That isn’t part of our strategy, and so in all the partnership deals that we have been doing, it really has been about bringing into robotic surgery technologies that we think are complementary and lead to better outcomes or fast procedures, and so we continue to do that. I think our teams are working well with our technology partners, and those are complex programs, but I think they are high value. 
Tycho Peterson – J.P. Morgan:  Lastly on the inventory management issues, have we from your sense worked through the worst of it? Obviously, it looks like revenues per procedures are up this quarter and that’s reflective of inventories coming up a little bit, but what is your sense going forward as to where we are from a management perspective from your customers? 
Benjamin Gong:  That’s a hard one to tell. One thing that stood out to us was in Q1, there seemed to be some active inventory management among our customer base, and in  Q2 and Q3, it seemed to be less so, but I think that’s something that’s just going to be subject to fluctuation. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.
Unidentified Analyst: We recently had a very short survey that seemed to indicate a little bit more interest in upgrades, meaning the current S systems being upgraded to the SI, and certainly you do have some upgrades this quarter. Is this a real opportunity that we should think about, and is there a way to handicap that?
Benjamin Gong: I would say that we were pleasantly surprised with the number of upgrades we had. Again, to review of the 23 that we had, 13 of them pertain to the first quarter offers, but the other 10 were upgrades, and that was a pretty fair chunk of revenue. I think it’s hard for us right now to judge how many we’re going to get on a quarterly basis. We’ll probably want to monitor it a little bit more.
Lonnie M. Smith: I think the place where we’ll often see it is when somebody buys the new SI, and they have an S and they like to make it consistent for surgeon use and for the OR staff, and so that’s the ideal time to upgrade an S to an SI.
Benjamin Gong: Of those 10, a fair number of those were at the same time that an existing customer was buying another system, and they wanted to upgrade their existing system at the same time.
Unidentified Analyst: I know you are not ready to comment on the timeline in Japan, but is it feasible to think at this point that we’re going to see placements in Japan sometime in 2010 or is it more of a longer term opportunity?
Gary Guthart: We’re working it down. I don’t think you’ll see an explosion in 2010 but we are hopeful that we can get some systems in.
Unidentified Analyst: Maybe later in the year rather than earlier?
Lonnie M. Smith: Time will tell.
Unidentified Analyst: On JAMA study that just came out, I appreciate the feedback, and you can certainly question the methods and the conclusions for the study, but I am curious to know if you expect any impact on procedures. I know a lot of times it happens when patients read the paper that’s what they see and they don’t actually read the actual study or look at the actual data. Do you expect to see any impact on the volume of prostatectomies you currently get because of the study?
Aleks Cukic: I think you’re right. I think patients read headlines and make conclusions, but thankfully what we have found thus far is that the urologic community, which I think is ultimately the strongest source for these patients as they are conversing with their doctors and their physicians are aware of the faults if you will of the conclusions and I think as the data disseminates, I think it will ultimately help influence the patient’s decision. I’ll say that I don’t know exactly how to answer your question with a definitive position because it is forward looking, but our belief is and the people we have spoken to the clinicians did not put a lot of weight into that study, and I think their impact on the patient’s decision is going to be important.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Sameer Harish – Needham & Company
Sameer Harish – Needham & Company: Just want to followup a little bit on the investments you’re making in R&D and sales and marketing. Just in general terms can you talk a little bit about the longevity of these investments? Do you expect to continue to be increasing these as a percentage of revenue into next year or is this likely to be completed this year?
Lonnie Smith: I think on the R&D side, we will expect to continue to increase investments in revenue at a pace about what you’re seeing as a percentage of revenue, and we invest on multiple time horizons, from things we expect to be out in months to things we think will take many years to develop and come to fruition.
Benjamin Gong : On the SG&A side in particular with the field, we added 30 people into the field this past quarter, and we have not really slowed down in our hiring. Again, as we place more systems out there and we have this 49% procedure growth year over year, it requires us to have a lot more people out there in the field, so we plan to continue to hire people in the field at a pretty good pace.
Sameer Harish – Needham & Company: I don’t think you guys gave an update on the share buyback, but could you talk a little bit about use of cash going forward?
Lonnie Smith: It has not changed from what we have said in the past. The cash is there for growth opportunities and flexibility. We’re glad we got it, and to your question, we have not made a decision on what we are going to do with the remaining authorization we have gotten from the board, but we keep it in mind, and over time if we believe that the cash is excess to our needs, we’ll return it to shareholders similar to what we have done in the past.
Sameer Harish – Needham & Company: Is there more interest in licensing or acquisitions in the future, and if there is, could you talk about potential area?
Lonnie Smith: We continue to enjoy the flexibility that the cash gives to license things that we think are a good fit to us, and we’ll continue to do that. On the other hand, it’s not burning a hole in our pockets to go invest it when we are not ready to do so.
Gary Guthart: We don’t think it’s particularly useful to telecast the things we are looking at or interested in looking at.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Sean Lavin with Lazard Capital Markets.
Sean Lavin – Lazard Capital Markets: Just a couple of quick question with help with modeling, can you tell us what the average price was on the SI upgrades, what portion of these upgrades had a second console and how much of a discount do you give to hospitals trading in an old non-S system?
Benjamin Gong: Even though we don’t give you the specifics on that Sean, maybe I can help you a little bit. The $10 million we had in upgrade revenue, I think $3 million of that had to do with the 13 that were from Q1. The remaining $7 million was primarily the other 10 upgrades, but we also had some fourth arm and HD upgrades, something on the order of $1 million of that, and there were actually as you pointed out a couple of second consoles that people bought a la carte let’s say, all in that extra $7 million.
Sean Lavin – Lazard Capital Markets: Any help on what kind of discount you give to people trading in the old systems?
Benjamin Gong: We’re not specific on that. We do give them a credit, and you notice when you have a large number like 20 of them, that in combination with fewer direct sales into Europe caused our ASP to go down by about $40,000 from last quarter to this quarter.
Sean Lavin – Lazard Capital Markets: If you could quantify the inventory writedown that you talked affecting margins?
Benjamin Gong: It was a little less than $2 million.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Ricci – Wachovia.
Vincent Ricci – Wachovia: Generally speaking, the procedures you guys have been most successful for, these have been open procedures, you’re converting to minimally invasive such as prostatectomy or the oncological hysterectomies. You’re targeting colorectal and general surgery, you guys have talked about it on and off as being a good procedure for you guys, but also Covidien and Epicon have discussed these procedures as well. Maybe can you differentiate for us that these are different procedures that guys are looking at and if there is a different strategy attacking this area?
Aleks Cukic:  I can’t comment on their strategy, but I would say this that if my history is right, the first laparoscopic colon procedures were reported on in the early ’90s. I recall when some of them were being done then, and here we are 16 years later, and there is a light penetration in overall colorectal procedures. For many reasons, the prostatectomy business had gone really unpenetrated with general laparoscopy. It’s difficult to do, and so what I think you see in today’s laparoscopic colorectal is you see a lot of right colons and perhaps some transverse, and you start getting less penetration as you go down the colon and get into the low rectal procedures. It’s not by coincidence that that’s probably one of our fastest areas of growth because it’s very difficult to do laparoscopically, and some of the early adoption in da Vinci is starting there, so that’s fairly similar is that we are starting in the more difficult places where I would say that laparoscopic is started in some of the easier places, so we’ll see where that ultimately goes. I think when you look at improving visualization, you can improve the necessary suturing, manage vascularity differently, and do more precise surgery which tends to come with robotics over laparoscopy and in Intuitive motion and motion scaling and everything else. You tend to put yourself in good position to get those procedures, so we know we need a few extra instruments, we’re working on those instruments, and we’ll see where that goes.
Vincent Ricci – Wachovia: As long as you’re talking about instruments, Gary, quickly mentioned the stapler? Can you guys talk a little bit about the progress there?
Gary Guthart:  We’re working down the heart of the development pathway here, so we know what we want to do and we are in the middle of doing it, and that’s about what I can tell you right now. I think so far so good. 
Vincent Ricci – Wachovia: Maybe just looking at this from slightly different standpoint of metrics that you guys have given in the past, could you possibly talk to us about kind of what your clip is on training doctors historically over the last couple of quarters?
Lonnie Smith : Training doctors has been pretty consistent. Generally pretty high.
Gary Guthart: I think you should think of our training initiatives as one big bucket, but within that bucket, there is going to be a mix. In other words, you can imagine that ’04, ’05, ’06 had a huge urology focus in that training whereas ’07, ’08, ’09 probably has more GYN, and so on and so forth. I think that will be the nature of our training programs as procedure targets change and procedure opportunities grow, you’ll see that change, but overall, training is very important to us. It’s very important to our customers, and we plan to do it as much as we can in the area of training.
Lonnie Smith : As I previously said while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. One of our metrics for patient satisfaction is a survey of patients who have contacted da Vinci surgeons through our physician locator. This is a blinded survey, so we don’t know the identity of the patients or their surgeons, but the patients who responded as having had a da Vinci procedure, 93.2% were extremely satisfied or very satisfied, and when asked if they would recommend the procedure to other people in the same situations as themselves, 100% of the GYN and general surgery patients and 98.1% of the prostate cancer patients responded, yes, they would recommend it to others. I hope that the following patient’s personal story will give you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. I’ll start with John. John is a 65-year-old engineer from Mascot in the United Kingdom. He said he was shocked when he received his PSA score and set out to read everything he could about prostate cancer including Dr. Walsh’s book. Having looked at all the competing therapies including radiation, he came to the conclusion that having the cancer removed was the most definitive option, but was very concerned about urinary incontinence. He believed that finding the right surgeon was the key to minimizing potential risks. The result, even though the cancer was more widespread than originally thought, all postoperative tests have come back negative, and urinary control returned 8 days post operation. For John, the final benefit of his da Vinci prostatectomy was that he able to compete on one of his vintage motorcycles in an event 2-1/2 weeks after his surgery. The second patient, Greg, required major surgery to treat pancreatic cancer surgery in which the pancreas, gallbladder, duodenum, and lower part of the stomach were removed followed by major reconstruction; it’s called the Whipple procedure. Greg chose to have his surgery at the Cleveland Clinic because they would perform it minimally invasively with the da Vinci Surgical System. A few weeks after surgery, Greg visited Detroit and met another patient who had had the same procedure with open surgery. He commented on the stark contrast of their individual experiences post-operation. Six months after the surgery, the other patient still had not returned to work. In contrast, Greg said, 2 weeks after his surgery, he was walking through a mall and visiting a bookstore. Patients like these are the strongest advocates for the surgery with the da Vinci system and are the very foundation of our operating performance. In closing, I assure you that we remain committed to focusing on the vital few things that truly make a difference as we strive to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hands. That concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support in this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.

First, Lonnie will present the quarter's business highlights. Gary will follow with operational highlights. Marshall will follow with a review of our second quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss sales and marketing highlights, then I'll provide our financial forecast for 2009, and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'd like to introduce Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO. 
Lonnie M. Smith: Thank you for joining us today. It has been an interesting 6 months. Despite the challenging economic environment, patients, surgeons, and hospitals continue to recognize the value our products bring to surgery and surgical outcomes. During the first six months, procedures grew by 56%, which compares well with the 50% in the first half of last year. Revenue grew by 12% excluding the revenue deferrals and reversals that will wash out by year end. While this is not the 60% growth we enjoyed in the first half of last year, I consider our ability to remain in positive growth territory during the worst worldwide economic downturn since the Great Depression a significant accomplishment and our team’s operational execution exceptional. Pro forma operating income year to date before revenue deferrals and non-cash stock option expense grew by 12%. We repurchased $150 billion in stock at an average price just under $107 per share, invested $40 million in capital and intellectual property, reduced working capital by $21 million, and ended the first half with $902 million in cash and investments--equal with year end 2008 and $162 million than this time last year.  As most of you know, we took a $20 million revenue deferral in the first quarter, associated with our offer to customers who purchased Da Vanci S systems in the first quarter to upgrade to the new SI system. We recognized $14 million of that deferral in the second quarter.  I excluded the impact of the revenue deferral in my summary of our first quarter financial performance and will exclude the reversal of deferred revenues in my summary of the second quarter. With that background, operating highlights for the second quarter excluding the $14 million in deferred revenue during the quarter were as follows: Procedures grew approximately 52% over the second quarter of 2008. We sold 76 Da Vinci Surgical Systems, down from 85 in the second quarter of last year. Our international team contributed 20 of the 76 systems sold. We ended the second quarter with 1242 Da Vinci systems installed worldwide. Total revenue was $247 million, up from 13% from last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $94 million, up 28%, and total recurring revenue grew $136 million, up 32% from prior year, comprising 55% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $110 million, before revenue deferral and non-cash 123R stock option expense, up 13% from the second quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with $902 million in cash and investments, up $80 million from last quarter. Significant cash outlays during the quarter include $13 million invested in intellectual property and property, plant, and equipment. Excluding the impact of this outlay, $6 million in cash for stock proceeds and $7 million change in working capital, we generated $80 million in gross cash from operations, $2.07 per fully diluted share and 128% of our GAAP reported net income in the second quarter. With that, I’ll pass the time over to Gary Guthart, our President and Chief Operating Officer. 
Gary S. Guthart: During our last earnings call, we announced the introduction of our new Da Vinci SI surgical system, and during Q2, we had the opportunity to showcase the SI system at several major conferences, which included the American Urology Association, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the World Robotic Gynecologic Symposium, the American Association of Thoracic Surgery, and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgery to name a few, with an excellent customer response. Evidence of this response can be seen in the proportion of the SI system sales within our Q2 results, achieving 62% of system sales in the quarter. The improved vision system, enhanced user interface, and dual console capability which expands the surgical training paradigm have been well received in both academic and community medical centers. We will continue to extend the SI product offering to other international markets during the subsequent quarters. Speaking of the new SI, Dr. Jay Michael Smith, a leading cardiac surgeon at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, remarked, “The SI dual console will bring a huge opportunity for robotic surgery in complex procedures, both in the ability to train surgeons in advanced technique and in the ability to work collaboratively during a case. It takes the fourth arm from a static retractor to a dynamic instruments that exceeds the capability of a bedside assistant by giving them articulation and 3-D vision.” Of the new Vision system, Dr. Tim Wilson, an experienced laparoscopic and robotic urologic surgeon at City of Hope Medical Center in Los Angeles reported, “I think this is the best image I’ve ever seen in any laparoscopic surgery.”  For the systems installed to date, the SI has been used in approximately 1000 cases. The SI’s clinical performance and dependability have exceeded our expectations. As always, we remain committed to developing significant products that deliver clinical value to patients, are easy to use, and facilitate repeatable and teachable procedures. We continue to invest in developing novel instruments for our Da Vinci platform and improving and expanding our imaging capabilities and developing new patient side mechanism and in creating surgical networking and training technologies. Our development teams are focused on bringing high clinical value products to the market quickly while our manufacturing organization is relentless in the pursuit of quality, efficiency, cost reduction, and inventory management. With that, I will turn the call over to Marshall for a review of financial highlights.
Marshall L. Mohr: As reported last quarter, we offered certain first quarter customers the opportunity to upgrade their Da Vinci S systems to Da Vinci SI systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return Da Vinci S accessories in exchange for Da Vinci SI accessories. As a result, we deferred a total of $20.1 million in revenue in the first quarter comprising of $18 million of system revenue associated with the system upgrade offer and $2.1 million of accessory revenue. These customers were given until June 30th to accept our offers.  In our second quarter of 2009, we recognized $13.8 million of the total $20.1 million originally deferred. Nineteen of the 45 system upgrade offers were accepted. $12.4 million of the $13.8 million related to 26 declined system upgrade offers and six completed system upgrades. $1.4 million of the $13.8 million related to accessory exchange offers declined or completed. We expect the remaining first quarter deferred revenue of $6.3 million associated with 13 accepted upgrade offers to be recognized by the end of 2009. To provide listeners with comparable information, I will now walk you through our revenue results excluding the first quarter deferral of $20.1 million and the second quarter recognition of $13.8 million. Our second quarter revenue was $247 million, up 13%, compared with $219 million for the second quarter 2008, and up 18% compared with $208 million for the first quarter of 2009.  Second quarter revenues by product category are as follows: Second quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $94 million, up 28% compared with $74 million for the second quarter of 2008, and up 16% compared with $82 million in the first quarter of 2009. The change compared with the second quarter of last year was driven by procedure growth of 52%. The change compared with the first quarter reflects increased procedure volume and customer buying patterns.  The amount of instrument and accessory we realized per procedure including initial staffing orders was approximately $1880 per procedure, down approximately $360 per procedure compared to last year and up $90 per procedure compared to the first quarter. The decline in revenue per procedure compared to the second quarter of 2008 reflects lower stocking orders, procedure efficiency as certain customers are using less instruments per procedure, and customer buying patterns. The increase from last quarter primarily reflects customer buying patterns.  Second quarter 2009 systems revenue of $114 million was $5 million lower than the $116 million of systems revenue for the second quarter of 2008 and $24 million higher than the $87 million of systems revenue for the first quarter. We sold 76 systems in the second quarter of 2009, compared with 85 systems last year and 66 systems last quarter. We continue to feel the impact of curtailed hospital spending for capital equipment in the ongoing economic recession, particularly in the US. Fifty-six systems were sold in the US during the quarter, compared with 66 systems last year and 44 systems last quarter. Twenty systems were sold outside of the US, compared with 19 last year and 22 last quarter. Forty-seven of the 76 or 62% of the units in the quarter were Da Vinci SI systems.  Our first quarter average sales price per system including all Da Vinci models but excluding upgrades and the revenue deferral was $1.43 million, and increase from the $1.33 million realized in the first quarter reflecting the 62% mix of Da Vinci SI systems of which five were sold with second consoles.  Service revenue increased to $41 million, up 40% compared with $29 million last year and up 5% compared with $39 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total second quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory, and service revenue increased to $136 million, up 32% compared with the second quarter of 2007 and up 12% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Recurring revenue represented 55% of total second quarter revenue compared with 47% in the second quarter last year and 58% last quarter. Moving on to gross margins, there were no costs deferred in conjunction with the $20.1 million revenue deferral, and therefore, all of the $20.1 million first quarter deferral and the $13.8 million second quarter recognition had an equal impact on revenue, gross profit, operating income, and pretax income. Excluding the impact of the deferral activities, gross margins were approximately equal in the first and second quarters of 2009 at about 71.5% and slightly better than the 71.2% realized in the second quarter of 2008.  Second quarter 2009 operating expenses of $91 million were up 16% compared with second quarter 2008 and up 8% compared with the first quarter. The quarter over quarter increase reflects commissions associated with higher revenue, costs associated with 34 employees added during the quarter, higher non-cash 123R compensation, and increased R&D costs. In addition, patent amortization expense increased to $3.8 million for the quarter compared with $2.2 million during the second quarter of 2008 and $3.5 million last quarter. Second quarter 2009 operating income was $100 million or 38% of sales compared with $78 million or 36% of sales for the second quarter of 2008 and $45 million or 24% of sales for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the first quarter deferral and the second quarter recognition, second quarter 2009 operating income was $86 million or 35% of sales, compared with $78 million or 36% of sales for the second quarter of 2008 and $65 million or 31% of sales for the first quarter of 2009. Second quarter 2009 operating income reflected $25 million of non-cash stock compensation expense, compared with $20 million for the second quarter of 2008 and $23 million last quarter. The increase in 123R expense primarily reflects the impact of our annual option grant made on February 17th. Our second quarter 2008 other non-operating income of $5.2 million was approximately the same as the first quarter of 2009 and approximately $500,000 less than the second quarter off 2008. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 40.4% was slightly higher than our anticipated rate of 40% due primarily to higher state taxes.  Our net income was $62 million or $1.62 per share, compared with $51 million or $1.28 per share for the second quarter of 2008 and $28 million or $0.72 per share for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the first quarter deferral and the second quarter recognition, our net income was $54 million or $1.40 per share compared with $51 million or $1.28 per share for the second quarter of 2008 and $40 million or $1.02 per share last quarter.
 : Our accounts receivable balance increased to $175 million at June 30th, from $139 million at March 31st. The increase in receivables reflects increased revenue. Our net inventory decreased to $59 million at June 30th from $64 million at March 31st. Our inventory declined during the second quarter primarily due to the utilization of material built up to support the Da Vinci product launch.  With that, I’d like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing, and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: During the second quarter, we sold 76 da Vinci systems, 56 in the United States, 12 in Europe, and 8 into rest of world markets. A total of 5 systems were part of trade-in transactions. The net 71 additions to the installed base brings to 1242 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 916 in the United States, 221 in Europe, and 105 in rest of world markets. Sixteen of the 76 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers, which included a fifth system to Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati and third system to Florida Hospital in Celebration, Florida, and Florida Hospital in Orlando, Florida, and Strong Memorial in Rochester, NY. This brings to 152 the total number of customers who own two or more da Vinci systems. Internationally, we placed 4 da Vinci systems into Germany, 3 into the UK, and 2 into both France and Qatar.  Clinically, we had an excellent quarter. For the third quarter in a row, we had double digit sequential procedure growth, both domestic and internationally. Demand for da Vinci hysterectomy, both for benign and malignant conditions, sacral colpopexy, myomectomy, partial nephrectomy, cystectomy, and da Vinci prostatectomy were most notable. We also experienced early international demand for a number of our general surgery procedures, specifically Da Vinci colon and rectal procedures and Da Vinci thyroidectomy, most of which is emanating from Asia.  In Q2, well over 200 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts were published within peer reviewed journals, and as Gary mentioned, our participation within various medical conferences corresponding with the Da Vinci SI launch was very strong. Over the past several quarters, the management of endometrial and cervical cancer has been one of our largest and fastest growing areas of focus. The clinical value of converting these predominantly open high invasive operations to a minimally invasive da Vinci procedure has become widely accepted. The surgeons at Northwestern University Medical Center in Chicago reported the impact this shift was having on fellowship training at their university. Dr. Anna Hogstra and team authored a paper entitled, “Robotic Surgery in GYN Oncology: The Impact on Fellowship Training” which was published in the May edition of the Journal of Gynecologic Oncology. Prior to the adoption of da Vinci hysterectomy for both endometrial and cervical cancer,  Northwestern’s fellows predominantly participated in open surgery which represented 94.4% of their surgical oncologic training. This percentage corresponded with the level of open cancer surgery within their practice, but three months post da Vinci implementation, the fellows participated in robotic procedures was up to 45%. After six months, 72%; and after 12 months, it was up to 92%. The author summary was as follows, and I quote, “Fellows surgical training underwent a dramatic change with the introduction of robotic surgery program. The management of endometrial and cervical cancer was impacted the most by robotics. Robotic surgery broadened fellowship surgical training, but balanced surgical training and standardized fellow training modules remain challenges for fellowship programs.”  The transition from open surgical oncologic management toward Da Vinci is not limited to US borders. In the May edition of the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology, Dr. Magioni and Piretti from the European Institute of Oncology, a teaching hospital in Milan, Italy, published a paper which outlined their significant shift toward the robotic approach to endometrial and cervical cancer surgery. The authors reviewed patient data from 80 consecutive da Vinci hysterectomies for endometrial carcinoma. Data collected included BMI, operating time, histology, blood loss, conversions and postop pain management. Rather than run through all the numbers and statistics associated with their findings, I’ll sum it up with their conclusion which I believe says enough, and I quote, “Over a relatively short time using the Da Vinci surgical system, we observed a substantial change in our surgical activity. For endometrial cancer, open surgical procedures decreased fro 78% to 35%. Moreover, our preliminary data confirmed that surgical robotic staging for early stage endometrial cancer is feasible and safe. Age, obesity, and previous surgery do not seem to be contraindications.”  The incorporation of Da Vinci into residency and fellowship training programs has become increasingly popular, which we believe represents a meaningful and potentially powerful shift in the training pathway of future attending surgeons, in both the US and abroad. We’ve not commented much on our cardiac business during the past few calls, but we did see a nice increase in both Da Vinci mitral valve repair and Da Vinci revascularization procedures during the quarter. We’ve always believed that patients evaluate their surgical treatment options using an equation that balances efficacy and invasiveness. There is perhaps no clear example of a more favorable score than that associated with a Da Vinci cardiac procedure. Even though the growth of cardiac category has not mirrored urology or gynecology, the relief from postoperative pain and suffering probably exceeds them both. In the April edition of the journal Cardiology, Dr. Bonatti and team from Innsbruck Medical University in Innsbruck, Austria, and the University of Maryland in Baltimore set out to evaluate postsurgical quality of life at 3, 6, and 12 months, comparing open revascularization to da Vinci revascularization. The study included 120 patients split pretty evenly between open sternotomy and Da Vinci’s endoscopic approach. Nine patients were converted from an endoscopic approach to a sternotomy which were also assessed postoperatively. The comprehensive analysis evaluated several factors, including but not limited to hospitalization, operating time, postsurgical pain and discomfort, time to resuming normal activities such as taking shower, gardening, riding a bicycle, driving a car, and shopping. The result of the comparisons was pretty dramatic.  Hospitalization for the da Vinci patients was approximately half as long when compared to the open patients. The time to take a shower was reduced from 9.8 days for an open approach to 3.7 days for the da Vinci approach. Gardening was reduced from 54.2 days to 22.2 days, driving a car from 35.5 days to 16.4 days, walking outdoors from 15.5 days to 6.2 days, and riding a bicycle was shortened from 67.2 days to 28.2 days. I think you get the picture. Virtually all quality of life metrics improve significantly incorporating the da Vinci approach. In their conclusion, the authors remarked, and I quote, “TCAB using robotic technology leads to improved physical health, shorter hospital stay, and more rapid restoration of daily activity. Conversion from TCAD to sternotomy does not lead to a quality of life impairment as compared with primary sternotomy.”  Regarding our urology business, we continue to see a tremendous adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and partial nephrectomy, pyeloplasty, and da Vinci cystectomy taking place on a worldwide basis. The agenda at this year’s AUA Conference held in Chicago was a Da Vinci testimonial in and of itself. Presentations, clinical abstracts, live surgeries, postgraduate robotic courses, and booth presentations dominated this year’s conference. The mass global appeal of da Vinci-based procedures within the specialty of urology is truly material. During the 4-day conference, we registered over 1000 urologists at our booth, representing nearly 40 countries. The most popular area of inquiry remained DVP; however, Da Vinci partial nephrectomy, cystectomy, and pyeloplasty are all procedures that are being rapidly adopted. Among the more interesting abstracts at this year’s AUA pertained to prostate cancer mortality rates following radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation, and primary androgen deprivation therapy. A large multicenter series was derived from the CAPTURE Registry which accrues patients from 31 practice sites prospectively and follows then under a uniform protocol regardless of treatment and follows them through death or withdrawal from the study. 8321 men with localized disease at the time of the diagnosis with at least 6 months followup after radical prostatectomy, EBRT, or PADT were analyzed. The study was authored by Dr. Matthew Cooperberg and the Urologic Oncology Group from the University of California at San Francisco. The study used CAPRA scoring which is cancer of the prostate risk assessment which is a well-validated instrument incorporating PSA, Gleason score, age, percentage of biopsy cores positive, and caner stage. A parametric survival model was constructed to compare outcomes among different treatments adjusting for CAPRA score and age.  It was a very comprehensive and statistically relevant approach toward assessment the various treatment methods. The results: 261 men died of prostate cancer at a median 6.4 years followup. Adjusting for age and risk, the hazard ratio for cancer specific mortality was twice as high for an external beam radiation therapy than for radical prostatectomy and 2.3 times as high for primary androgen deprivation therapy versus radical prostatectomy. The author’s conclusion, and I quote, “Surgery for localized prostate cancer is associated with a significant and substantial reduction in cancer-specific mortality relative to EBRT and PADT. Although not a randomized study, the analysis was adjusted for clinical risk and age, and it is unlikely that the unmeasured cofounders would account for the large observed difference in survival.” Our strong belief has always been that the removal of the cancerous prostate through surgery is the most effective treatment for patients with localized prostate cancer, especially so when taking into account long-term survival. As patients are diagnosed earlier in life and better informed on their treatment options, we would expect our DVT opportunity to further expand.  This concludes my summary, and I now will turn the time over to Ben.
Benjamin Gong:  I’ll be providing an update on our forecast for 2009 based on our results in Q2. First and foremost, procedure growth which is the primary driver of our total revenues continues to be strong. Procedures grew approximately 52% in the second quarter. In our last earning call, we forecasted procedures to grow more than 40% for the year. We are increasing our forecast on procedures to grow more than 45% for the year. This will continue to drive significant growth in our instrument and accessory revenues; however, as we have mentioned previously, variations in initial stocking orders and customer ordering patterns can cause our instrument and accessory revenues to fluctuate and difficult to forecast on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we will not be reinstating guidance for instrument and accessory revenues at this time. Likewise, while strong procedure growth continues to drive high demand for system sales, the general slowdown in hospital capital spending makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast how many systems we will be selling in the near term. Therefore, we also will not be reinstating guidance on system revenues at this time.  Our service revenue model has been very consistent, and we expect it to remain as it has in the past. We’re generating an average of about $148,000 in service revenue per system per year. Since our revenue is driven largely by the installed base, we continue to expect service revenue to grow approximately 35% this year.  With regard to gross margin, excluding the one-impact of the $20 million revenue deferral in Q1 and the release of a portion of that deferral in Q2, our gross margins have been very consistent with that of previous quarters. Since the balance of Q1 revenue deferral will be recognized the end of the year, the deferral should have no net impact on gross margin in 2009. In our last earnings call, we forecasted our gross margin for the year to come in between 70% and 71%. Based on our gross margins to date, we estimate that gross margin for the year will be approximately 71%.  With regard to operating expense, last quarter we provided a forecast of growing our GAAP operating expense by approximately 17% in 2009. We are increasing our estimate to 18% to 20% growth in operating expense based on two factors. First, we estimate our stock compensation charge for the year to be approximately $98 million compared with our previous estimate of $95 million. Secondly, we’re hiring more field personnel to drive continued procedure growth, and we’re increasing our investments in new and existing R&D projects to drive growth in our long-term business. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect to report a GAAP tax rate of approximately 40% for the balance of the year. For calculating earnings per share, we ended the quarter with approximately 37.9 million shares outstanding, and approximately 700,000 shares were added to the diluted share count for calculating EPS in Q2. For the balance of the year, assuming we do not repurchase any additional stock, we expect our share count for calculating EPS to be between 38.6 million and 39 million shares. Finally, regarding our cash flows, we continue to generate significantly more cash than our reported net income. For the first six months of 2009, we generated $173 million in cash flow from operations, compared with our reported net income of $90 million over the same periods. The largest contributor of this difference was our recording of approximately $47 million of FAS123R stock compensation expense year to date, and we expect to record an additional $51 million in stock compensation expense in the second half of this year. As a result, our cash flow should continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we ask that you limit your inquiry to a couple of questions, and for any followup questions, please get back onto the queue. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator:  (Operator instructions) The first question comes from the line of Tao Levy from Deutsche Bank
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: On the gross margin side, you’ve given the number of SI that you sold and also your procedure growth. I would have thought maybe you would have seen some sequential improvement, excluding the deferrals, instead of just staying at 71.5%. Is there any scrap material related to the S or anything going on there?
Benjamin Gong: No, really there is not. Even though you have a higher ASP due to the higher price of the SI, the cost of producing an SI system is actually higher than it is for the S, and that’s why the gross margin was very similar even though you have a mix of SIs in the sales mix.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Aleks, you talked about the paper on prostate caner and long-term survival, have you looked at an analysis on the cost difference between the different therapies, and a question that kind of ties into that maybe for Lonnie because I’m sure he’s got a perspective on it, any thoughts on what’s going on with healthcare reform, the thoughts of comparative effectiveness, maybe having robotics a part of that?
Lonnie M. Smith: Clearly, we have. It’s interesting to me. Proton beam reimburses about $72,000 if you assume 40 treatments which is about the average, and IMRT reimburses, and these are CMS reimbursements, just under $40,000. Brachytherapy around $29,000; and surgery assuming comorbidities and complications is about $10,000. All of those include both the facility fees as well as the surgeon or the physician, and Aleks pointed out those numbers. Actually, there was a longitudinal study of a little over 3000 patients at Henry Ford and found that life expectancy over what you call conservative treatment which will be hormonal treatment or watchful waiting was 4.6 more years of life, and this is age adjusted, disease stage adjusted for radiation therapy, and 8.6 more years of life for surgery. Now, if you do a simple calculation, I’m a simple minded guy, I divide the cost by the number of years of additional expected life, and for proton beam, assuming it’s the same as other radiation therapies is about $16,000 per year of additional year of life, about $9000 for IMRT, about $6000 for seeds, and less than $1000 for surgery. So, in terms of comparative effectiveness and things like that, we’re big proponents of it, especially if it’s a level playing field, and people go into without a preset agenda. So we have some interesting days ahead, but I really do think that comparative effectiveness can lead us to a better place with healthcare both in terms of cost and outcomes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew – William Blair.  
Ben Andrew – William Blair: You talked about, I think, a relatively high percentage of de novo systems coming in this quarter in particular. Can you speak a little bit more about what you were hearing from customers and what you think was driving that mix shift?
Marshall L. Mohr: It’s hard to say in a single answer that drove each of them, but what would like to say is if you think about the customers that do not have a da Vinci system and the pressures that they face, for example, radical prostatectomy has moved to what is widely accepted now as standard of care through Da Vinci, if you are not participating in that, you have that impact on your radical prostatectomy program. If you look at the hysterectomy consolidation that is going on both for benign and malignant conditions, if you again have not participated in a robotics program, you have missed that and potentially will miss quite a few going forward, so if you put yourself in a position of a customer that has a system, your participating in it, and now you’re looking at your capacity and what you can do with that system or that second system or third system. If you do not have a system, you’re viewing it a little bit differently, and so I believe that customers are looking at that a little bit closer with really some pain that they are feeling on lost procedures.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Aleks, did you see anything relative to not as many people adding capacity or are they just working harder to take advantage of the capacity out of the existing system before buying a new one or was there something unusual there? 
Aleks Cukic:  I can’t answer that, but perhaps Jerry can give you some color on that.  
Jerome McNamara:  Over the last three quarters as we have gone into this change in the economic environment, we’ve seen customers try to extend the available slots per surgery per day, so they are really looking at their efficiencies and maximizing the number of surgeries before they buy a second system, so we have seen a shift in the buying pattern.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: As you look at the international rollout opportunity for the SI, what percentage of your available market if you will has access to that product and when would you get to broader rollout?
Gary S. Guthart: I guess the areas that we don’t have regulatory approval right now include Asian countries like Korea, China, and of course Japan where we don’t have any approval for any type of system, and then in other parts of the world, Canada, we are still waiting for approval there, and registration in some parts of South America. By and large, we have Europe pretty well covered, and we did sell SI systems in Europe this quarter.
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. 
David Lewis – Morgan Stanley:  Just thinking about revenue per procedure, I know you are not giving obviously a significant new guidance; obviously the procedure numbers were up, but your reversal in revenue per procedure was interesting. Does this indicate signal to that the relative level of destocking pressures have ceded or that the relative mix between hysterectomy and prostatectomy has ceded, so should we expect flat revenue per procedure going forward? 
Marshall Mohr:  You are right. We are not providing guidance. The amount of instrument and accessory revenue per procedure is going to vary from quarter to quarter based on the number of stocking orders or new system sales and stocking orders associated with it, and customer buying patterns will also have a big influence over it, and we are not ready to predict what those customer buying patterns are going to be for the next few quarters. 
David Lewis – Morgan Stanley:  Marshall, was there a reason that this quarter would have seen a reversal in that trend, and why that may not be repeatable in a forward quarter? 
Marshall Mohr:  We believe we have seen in the first quarter particularly and at the end of even Q4 we saw hospitals managing their inventories and their costs very closely, and so we believe they managed them down more so in the first quarter. It’s just not possible for us to predict how much more they need to manage them or will manage them going forward. 
David Lewis – Morgan Stanley:  In terms of new system placements, the de novo placements in the US market place, can you give us a sense of those? It sounds like 40 new system placements or new version placements. What was the average size of the hospital in terms beds that those systems were placed into? 
Marshall Mohr: 
 :
Jerry McNamara: I don’t know that there is a differentiation on the size of the hospital and a correlation between that and the de novo system purchases. If you want some steps, there are three steps that people typically want. The large hospitals, there are 457 sites with 614 systems. The medium-sized hospitals, 176 sites with 190 systems, and the small hospitals, 100 sites with 112 systems, totaling 733 sites in the US with 916 systems.  
David Lewis – Morgan Stanley:  You are obviously expanding R&D it sounds like here in the back half of the year, but if you think about a series of deals the company did, some externally and some internally as it relates to attacking single port procedures or better visualization, when can we start seeing some of the significant product launches associated with what seem to a pretty substantial internal focus on this area starting middle of last year? 
Gary Guthart:  As we’ve said before, we don’t announce timelines for them before they are ready to be launched. In general, our investments are really focused on long term, so a lot of these things are all looking out into the future, both in IP acquisitions and in technology developments that will give us growth into the future. 
David Lewis – Morgan Stanley:  Let me ask you just one different way. One of your quasi-competitors in the instrument space is thinking of rolling out better articulating instruments in the back half of 2010. Do you think the marketplace as you see it is ready for single port procedures and articulating instruments in back half of 2010?  
Gary Guthart:  I think we’ve seen in the marketplace already several companies who are looking at single port and articulation. We think that the robotics will have a role to play in single port surgery, so we’ll have to see how they rollout, and we’ll see how we enter the market.
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.
Unidentified Analyst: I’m curious to hear how you guys view the mix of the SI versus the standard model systems going forward. Obviously, you have pretty impressive performance for the SI in the first quarter post launch. I’m just wondering does this have to do with teaching institutions purchasing more systems early on, or would you expect this kind of a mix to continue based on the benefits of the system?
Ben Gong:  Historically we have seen that a lot of customers like to have the most capable system that we offer, and that happened when launched da Vinci S in 2006, and we see it happening again with the launch of da Vinci SI, so we think the majority of the systems that we sell going forward will probably be da Vinci SI, although we are continuing to sell da Vinci S systems. 
Unidentified Analyst:  In terms of upgrades of your current installed base, did you see any upgrades in the quarter? Can you help us handicap that opportunity?
Ben Gong:  Yes. We made those offers to those Q1 customers which as Marshall mentioned 19 of those 45 offers were taken, and we were capable of installing 6 of those in the quarter, and we will install the other 13 in the latter part. Think of that as a concentrated number of upgrades. Other than that, we’ll probably see some upgrades from the existing customer base that purchased prior to Q1, but it’s probably not going to be a large number each quarter.  
Unidentified Analyst:  Obviously, you’re increasing investments in R&D and in clinical investments again. I’m just curious as to your thoughts about the environment. Do you feel a little bit more comfortable with the environment in terms of hospital capital spending and economic environment at this point that are you’re taking these actions or has anything changed? Obviously, you’re not updating guidance. Has anything changed in your mind now as of the end of the second quarter versus where you stood in the first quarter of ’09 when you withdrew the guidance?
Lonnie M. Smith: We don’t manage the business or our R&D on a quarter to quarter basis. We really believe that robotics will play a significant role in healthcare and surgery for decades, and we are investing with that kind of mindset, so we aren’t going to pull back because this quarter might be a little bit weaker or something else. We’re investing for the long term. We have been building this business from the beginning that way. We’ll continue to do so. We have high confidence in the long term, and that’s where we are investing for. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Sameer Harish with Needham & Company.
Sameer Harish – Needham & Company:  Did I hear correctly that you sold 5 second consoles in the quarter?
Marshall Mohr: That’s correct.  
Sameer Harish – Needham & Company:  Do you have an idea or can you talk a little about what you are expecting as far as salesforce expansion in numbers?
Jerry McNamara: We don’t provide the specifics on that. We did add 20 people to the field organization this past quarter, and that was on top of 25 people that we added in the first quarter, and that continues to comprise a large portion of the total headcount we add. That 20 in Q2 was out of a total of 34 people in the company, so we definitely are continuing to hire in the field. 
Sameer Harish – Needham & Company:  If we look at that international versus US, what do you think is the level of investment that you feel will be necessary for international growth in 2009? 
Jerry McNamara:  Part of the people that we are hiring are for the direct business in Europe, and we are again continuing to look at various ways of expanding through our distribution channels as well, so we’re investing not just through hiring in our direct business but hopefully investing with our distribution partners as well. 
Sameer Harish – Needham & Company:  I guess if you look at it as a change from what your expectations were last quarter, is most of that increase directed towards international or is it split pretty evenly? 
Lonnie M. Smith:  It’s consistent with the metrics that by which we measure the business in the past, so we add clinical heads as per a number of systems that are placed, so we’re sticking to the same metrics that we managed the business last year, the same metrics this year. 
Sameer Harish – Needham & Company:  Just to switch over to R&D. Again, as we look at it incremental versus last quarter, are you looking to invest more on product development or clinical work to expand indications? 
Gary S. Guthart:  We really invest in all of those things. We invest in clinical side, we invest in research and in development as well as some IP acquisitions, so you see it in all those buckets. There is not a radical change in which buckets these things go into. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: On the utilization of the SI, is there any change in mix? In other words, are you seeing adoption per procedures beyond what you saw with the traditional S system, and can you also comment on whether you’re seeing any interest, I know it’s early, for the dual console outside the teaching hospitals?
Marshall Mohr: As far as the first question, I don’t think there is enough data at this stage for us to make any or really expect that there is going to be much of a difference in terms of the uptake. I think there are a lot of variables that go into the success and the early success of a program depending on the commitment from the hospital and other factors. The system is certainly designed to improve ease of use and some of factors, but it’s early for us to say that it’s had a material impact on the rate of adoption yet. As far as your second question on the dual console, there were hospitals that were outside of the, call it, traditional larger academic medical centers that did purchase second systems. I should say they purchased dual console systems, and again these took place during the quarter, and we will be able to comment on it more as they become more familiar with a quarter’s worth of usage in the future, but there is definitely interest both within academic medical centers as well as outside within community-based, non-academic medical centers.
Jerry McNamara: But again, it’s really too early for us to give you a call on what percentage our sales are going to include dual consoles.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan:  Just a followup on the prostate market; obviously with the New England Journal article this spring, there’s been some noise that the number of prostatectomies could be impacted with potential declines in PSA testing overall as well. Can you just comment on whether that’s something that you’re picking up on still or are you still expecting the prostate market to grow significantly in the near term?
Lonnie M. Smith: It’s interesting. During the quarter, there was an AUA gathering of 15,000 urologists from around the world, and I can say that as long as I have been associated with this business, this debate has been going on, and certainly even longer than that, and I think it will continue for sometime in the future. There were some really spirited discussions on it. In our view as we look at it, we don’t look at it as something that is going to materially impact our business one direction or the other at this point.
Gary S. Guthart: The European portion of that study showed that there was improved survival rate, significant survival rate, with PSA testing, and the other part of the study was inconsistent in terms of the consistency of the testing, so at least for me, I’ll be tested. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Vincent Ricci with Wells Fargo Securities.
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo Securities:  Aleks, you guys mentioned increased adoption in general surgery, particularly lower anterior rectal surgery in Asia, and I’m just curious, has some of your ability to increase adoption there been around any kind of instrumentation you been working on? You called out some instrumentation that seems to be linked to that.  
Aleks Cukic:  No. There isn’t anything that the Asian community is getting that is not available in the US market or anywhere else for that matter, and you might be referring to something like a surgical stapler which we talked about developing. There is nothing that’s driving it there. I would say that the growth in the Asian businesses is certainly large, but there is also solid growth in the US business in colorectal surgery. Thyroidectomy on the other hand is largely driven out of Asia, but in terms of the colon and rectal surgery, sort of equal set of instruments globally and good growth going on globally, more so outside of the United States and Asia. 
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo Securities:  Is there any specific dynamic that makes thyroidectomy a good procedure in Asia or is that just more of a cultural thing?
Aleks Cukic: It’s something that they are certainly more sensitive about. They are more sensitive about the scaring that goes on with the operation in a traditional operation which is an incision in the neck, and again it is early for us to really draw a lot of conclusions other than the fact that it is growing very rapidly, and it is growing very rapidly in the Asian countries. 
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo Securities:  Marshall, there has been a lot of talk about tax reform. You guys clearly don’t have a lot of the problems that some companies that might be impacted would have, but you guys have also been talking about longer term tax planning initiatives. Can you just walk us through what we should be thinking about not only in the near term but also 2-3 years out?
Marshall Mohr:  A caveat in that is I don’t think the administration is done in their attempts to modify the tax code, so I can only speak to what we have seen so far, and based on what we have seen so far, our previous plans that were laid out are still okay, I guess, is the way to put it, and that means that sometime probably next year you’ll start to see some improvement in our tax rate, and we’re hopeful that we can get it down to like the mid 30s over time. 
Vincent Ricci – Wells Fargo Securities:  You guys have largely been on a run rate in the mid-teens for repeat placements, and I’m just curious, is there is a certain dynamic that helps drive that consistency there? 
Gary S. Guthart:  The dynamic that drives the second system placement is really hospital adoption in running out of capacity with their first, second, or third or whatever it might be. I don’t think there is anything that sort of stops it from being more in the mid teens or less than, so I think that’s probably coincidental.  
Lonnie M. Smith:  That was our last question. As I have said previously while we focus on the financial metrics such as revenues, profit, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following patients’ personal stories in their own words give you some sense of what that means in the lives of our patients. The first is Christie’s story. She says, “On December 15, 2008, I got the devastating news I had cancer. In a whirlwind, I was referred to an oncologist who determined I needed surgery which I had on January 22, 2009. At 2 p.m., my gynecologic oncologist and I had decided to use the da Vinci surgical system because we felt it was the safest and the most likely to provide satisfactory results. I went to sleep, and when I woke up my worst postoperative issue was nausea from the anesthesia. Around 8:30 a.m., my doctor happily discharged with simple but important instructions. Days 1 through 3 postop were spent mostly in bed, except fro a few important walks. By day 7, I no longer was taking even the mild pain pills I was prescribed, and on day 9, with my doctor’s permission, I was back on my treadmill, starting slowly of course. My surgery was an amazing success on several fronts, first because my surgeon had the freedom of movement and visibility, he was able to be sure that he removed all the cancer. I went from having stage 1b grade 3 endometrial cancer to no evidence of disease. By mid February, I formed a cancer advocacy research company. We provide research grants to medical students in our area. I speak to about 2000 people each month, less than 4 months after surgery, about cancer prevention, screening awareness, and about the da Vinci robotic system. It not only saved my life; it saved my quality of life.” The second is Beth’s story. “I am 30 years old. I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse at the age of 14. I went through my teenage years and a portion of my adult life before it needed to be repaired. When I began seeing my current cardiologist, Dr. Michael Bach, years ago, he made me aware that surgery would more than likely be in my future. My regurgitation was moderate to severe. I was as much prepared as I could be. My husband and I were married in October 2008, and the news came less than 2 months after our nuptials. The timing was difficult, but I kept my eye on the picture. My health was most important. We also want children, and my condition at the time would not have allowed it. Dr. Bach referred me to Dr. Douglas Murphy, and I’m forever grateful that he did. The procedure amazed me, and the overall experience was a positive one. There is pain and discomfort with any surgery, but overall it could have been much worse had it not been for the miracle hands of Dr. Murphy and the da Vinci surgery. Three and a half weeks later, I’m already feeling better than ever. My scarring is minimal, which was something that was important to me personally. I can’t say enough about this procedure and the experience I had. I feel so blessed in so many ways.” Patients like these are the strongest advocates for surgery with the Da Vinci system and are the foundation of our operating performance.  In closing, I assure you that we remain committed to focusing on the vital few things that truly make a difference as we strive to take beyond the limits of the human hand. That concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking to you again.

Operator: Good afternoon. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical’s first quarter 2009 conference call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Ben Gong, Vice President of Finance.
Benjamin Gong: Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me today we have Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO; Gary Guthart, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning. Before we begin, many of you are aware that our Form 8-K containing our press release was filed earlier than normal. That was unintentional. Our vendor for filing 8-Ks mistakenly filed it early this morning instead of waiting until after the press release went out. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused. Moving on, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today’s call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at www.intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today’s press release has been posted to our website. Today’s format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. First, Lonnie will present the quarter’s business highlights. Gary will follow with operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our first quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss marketing and clinical highlights. I will provide an update on our financial forecast for 2009, and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I would like to introduce Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO.
Lonnie M. Smith: Thank you for joining us today. Despite the challenging economic environment, I feel that our team’s operational execution was excellent. Revenues were up 11% over the prior year. We saw a one-time $20 million revenue deferral associated with our offer to customers who purchased the da Vinci S this past quarter to upgrade to the new da Vinci Si. Marshall will discuss the details of that accrual later. Procedures grew by 60% and operating costs were effectively controlled. Two factors affected our year-over-prior-year growth as hospitals responded to the current economic environment. We sold 8 fewer systems in the first quarter of 2009 than we did in 2008, and as a part of their effort to improve cash flow, hospitals reduced inventories by slowing the purchase of incoming supplies and that reduced the growth of our instrument and accessory revenue. With that as background, operating highlights for the first quarter excluding the one-time $20 million revenue deferral are as follows: Procedures grew 60% over the first quarter of 2008. We sold 68 da Vinci surgical systems, down 8 from 74 during the first quarter of last year. Our international team contributed 22 of the 66 systems sold. Total revenue was $208 million, up 11% over last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $82 million, up 32% before a $2 million accessory revenue deferral for potential future upgrades. Total recurring revenue grew to $121 million, up 36% from prior year comprising 58% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $88 million before the revenue deferral and non-cash 123R stock option expense, up 11% from the first quarter of last year. GAAP net income however was $28 million, down 36% from last year. We ended the quarter with $822 million in cash and investments, down $80 million from last quarter and up $122 million from last year. Significant cash outlays during the quarter include $27 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets and $150 million invested in our stock buyback during the quarter. Excluding the impact of these outlays as well as $6 million received from stock option proceeds and a $14 million change in working capital, we generated $17 million in gross cash flow from operations, $1.98 for fully diluted shares, and 278% of our reported GAAP net income for the first quarter. I share this number with you because I believe that it is the best measure of economic horsepower and performance of our company. With that I will pass the time over to Gary Guthart, our President and Chief Operating Officer.
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: Thank you, Lonnie. For the past several quarters we have made significant investments in research, development, and manufacturing. We’re pleased with the progress of our product development teams, our operating teams, and our technology partners, both in the depth of their achievements and in the speed with which they are accomplishing them. We continue to invest in developing novel instruments for our da Vinci platform, in improving and expanding our imaging capabilities, in developing new patient-side mechanisms, and in creating surgical networking and training technologies. On April 2nd we announced the availability of our newest da Vinci model, the da Vinci Si. The Si brings to market three significant innovations. First, it introduces a dual surgeons’ console for use during surgery which will allow new methods of training da Vinci surgeons and enable collaborative da Vinci surgery. With the Si, a surgeon sitting at a second console can view the same surgery as the primary surgeon and can be passed control of some or all of the da Vinci arms during a case. We believe this will both shorten the learning curve for new surgeons and will allow collaborative surgery in complex cases. Secondly, our InSite imaging system has been substantially redesigned for increased visual acuity and improved ease of use. The HD imaging system’s increased performance is analogous to the move from 720P to 10AVI in commercial television. We believe that the increased visual performance will continue to increase surgeon precision and confidence and will contribute to improved patient outcomes and shorter procedure times. The third significant improvement is the Si’s users interface which has been redesigned to allow simplified and integrated control of da Vinci and other operating room devices such as electrosurgical units. The simplified interface and improved ergonomics will allow for easier surgeon training and decreased surgeon workload during surgery. The Si system is FDA approved and CE marked. It is currently available in the United States and most of Europe. SI systems will be available with an option to purchase a second console. Existing S instruments and most S accessories are compatible with the Si systems and upgrade to S systems to the Si system is available for our current customers. In other developments, this quarter we acquired the assets of a Silicon Valley company, NeoGuide Systems that has been developing robotics for medical applications. Included in the purchase of patents and applications with early issue and filing dates covering basic concepts and the design and control of multi-link snake robotic systems for use in medicine. The addition of NeoGuide’s intellectual property to our organically developed technology and in-license technology from groups like Hansen Medical, Luna Innovations, SurgiQuest, and USGI Medical has established a strong IP base for Intuitive in single-incision and potentially NOTES robotics. Overall, we continue to drive our teams and investments into both our da Vinci platform and into new technologies that will advance robotic surgery. With that, I will turn the call over to Marshall for a review of financial highlights and to take you through the financial implications of the Si launch.
Marshall L. Mohr: Thank you, Gary. As Lonnie mentioned, our first quarter 2009 revenue of $188 million was net of $20.1 million of revenue deferred in association with the da Vinci Si upgrade offers. With the launch of the Si we made offers to first quarter da Vinci S customers to upgrade their systems to the new Si model and a discount to the upgrade price. We also extended offers to those customers to exchange da Vinci S camera equipment for Si camera equipment. We made these offers to be fair to the recent purchasers of da Vinci S systems who wanted to own the most capable system available. As a result of this program we deferred $18 million of system revenue and $2.1 million of accessory revenue. The $20.1 million of deferred revenue is anticipated to be realized before the end of this year as the upgrade-completed da Vinci Si camera equipment is shipped where the offers are declined. Net of the deferral are $188 million first quarter revenue was roughly equal to our first quarter of 2008 revenue and $43 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. First quarter revenues by product category are as follows: First quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $79.5 million, up 29% compared with $61.9 million for the first quarter of 2008 and down 3% compared with $81.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The change compared with the first quarter of last year was driven by the 60% procedure growth partially offset by the revenue deferral of $2.1 million and lower instrument and accessory revenue per procedure. The change compared with the fourth quarter reflects increased procedure volume more than offset by the revenue deferral of $2.1 million and lower revenue per procedure. The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we realized per procedure including initial stocking orders and adding back the deferred revenue of $2.1 million was approximately $1800 per procedure, down approximately $200 per procedure compared to the fourth quarter and down approximately $400 per procedure compared to the last year. The decline in revenue per procedure reflects lower stocking orders and customer order timings as our customers reduce their inventory investment. The year-to-year decline also reflects customer efficiency gains and procedure mix. First quarter 2009 systems revenue of $70 million was $29 million lower than the first quarter 2008 systems revenue and $44 million lower than fourth quarter systems revenue due primarily to the $18 million revenue deferral described earlier and lower system unit sales; 66 systems were sold during the first quarter of 2009 compared to 74 systems last year and 85 systems last quarter. We continue to feel the impact of curtailed hospital spending for capital equipment in the ongoing economic recession, particularly in US; 44 systems were sold in US during the quarter compared with 54 systems last year; 22 systems were sold outside of the United States compared with 20 last year. At first quarter, average revenue per system including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades and the revenue deferral was $1.33 million, roughly equal to that for the fourth quarter of 2008. There were 6 system sales involving trade-ins of da Vinci systems and 5 systems sales of refurbished units during the quarter. Our installed base of da Vinci systems now is up to 1171. Service revenue increased to $39 million, up 44% compared with $27 million last year and up 9% compared with $36 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by larger system installed base. Total first quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to $119 million, up 33% compared with the first quarter of 2008 and up 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. Recurring revenue grew to 63% of total first quarter revenue or 58% excluding revenue deferrals compared with 47% in the first quarter last year and 51% last quarter. Our first quarter 2009 gross margin of 68.3% decreased compared with 71.4% realized in the fourth quarter of 2008. There were no costs deferred in conjunction with the $20.1 million revenue deferral, and therefore all of the $20.1 million impacted gross profit operating income and pre-tax income. Excluding the impact of the deferral, gross margins were approximately equal to the fourth quarter of 2008. First quarter 2009 operating expenses of $84 million were up 29% compared with the first quarter of 2008 and up $1 million compared with the fourth quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with 41 employees added during the quarter, higher non-cash 123R stock compensation partially offset by lower consulting outside service, travel, and other operating expenses. First quarter 2009 patent amortization expense was $3.4 million compared to $1.4 million during the first quarter of 2008 and $3.2 million last quarter. First quarter 2009 operating income was $45 million or 23.9% of sales compared with $65 million or 34.5% of sales during the first quarter of 2008 and $83 million or 35.7% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2008. As I mentioned earlier, the revenue deferral directly impacted operating income by $20.1 million representing a 7.3 percentage point decrease relative to sales. First quarter 2009 operating income contained $22.7 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $14.6 million for the first quarter of 2008 and $21.4 million last quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in 123R expense primarily reflects the impact of our annual options grant made on February 17th. At first quarter 2009, other non-operating income was $5 million compared with $8.5 million during the first quarter of 2008 and $5.5 million last quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease is primarily due to lower interest earned on lower investment balances partially offset by higher foreign exchange losses. The reduction in investments reflects the $150 million stock re-purchase program. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 43.8% which is higher than our anticipated rate of 40% due primarily to a reduction in our long-term deferred taxed assets as a result of a change in California tax loss. In February, California revised its income apportionment computation which will reduce our California taxes beginning in 2011. However, tax assets previously established higher California tax rates are required to be written down to the future rates in the current quarter. Our net income was $28.1 million or $0.72 per share compared to $48.8 million or $1.12 per share for the first quarter of 2008 and $50.8 million or $1.27 per share last quarter. Our first quarter revenue deferral impacted net income by approximately $12.1 million or $0.30 per share. In March, the Board of Directors authorized the re-purchase of $300 million of the company’s common stock. In connection with this authorization, we entered into a $150 million accelerated stock re-purchase program with Goldman Sachs. In March, the company delivered the $150 million to Goldman and received and retired 1.4 million shares which is the minimum number of shares due under the program. Depending on the average daily volume weighted average share price over a specified period that will extend no longer than June, we could receive additional shares for retirement. The full impact of the retirement of 1.4 million shares will be realized in the second quarter. We ended the first quarter of 2009 with cash and investments and $822 million, down $80 million from December 31, 2008. The decrease reflects $150 million used to buy back and retire shares and $27 million invested in fixed assets intellectual property partially offset by $79 million in gross cash flow from operations. Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $139 million at March 31st from $170 million at December 31st. The decrease in receivables reflects lower first quarter revenue and continued excellent collections. Our net inventory increased to $64 million at March 31st from $63 million at December 31st. Our inventory growth was primarily due to materials acquired to support the da Vinci Si product launch. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing, and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic:  During the first quarter we sold 66 da Vinci systems, 44 in United States, 17 in Europe, and 5 into rest of world markets. A total of 6 system sales were part of trade-up transactions. The net 60 new system installations brings to 1171, the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide; 863 in the US, 211 in Europe, and 97 in rest of world markets; 17 of these 60 net systems installed during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers that included a fifth system which was an Si system to Hartford Hospital in Connecticut and third systems to UCLA Medical Center, Northside Hospital in Atlanta, and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. This brings to 146 the total number of customers which own two or more da Vinci systems. International sales were particularly strong and included 3 more da Vinci placements into China, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Clinically, we had an excellent quarter with strong double-digit sequential procedure growth, both domestic and internationally. Demand for da Vinci hysterectomy both for benign and malignant conditions, sacral colpopexy, myomectomy, partial nephrectomy, cystectomy, and da Vinci prostatectomy were most notable. We also experienced strong international demand for several general surgery procedures, specifically da Vinci colon and rectal procedures and da Vinci thyroidectomy. In Q1, well over 200 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts appeared within various peer reviewed journals, and our participation at the medical conferences was robust. Several case studies and series presentations were provided, but I’ll limit and highlight just a few. Last week, we had the clinical unveiling for the new da Vinci Si system at the World Robotics Symposium in Orlando, Florida. The conference featured 12 live da Vinci procedure broadcast which included DVPs, partial nephrectomy, cystectomy, and radical hysterectomy. The Orlando attendance represented approximately 300 clinicians, but the program was also simulcast to 150 urologists in Milan, Italy and over 100 in Seoul, Korea. The highlight of the program was the unveiling of the da Vinci Si, specifically, the cases performed with a dual console. The first case was a DVP performed by Dr. Vip Patel where Dr. Vip Patel controlled the instruments from one console and Dr. Bob Myers, Chairmen of the Department of Urology at the Mayo Clinic observed and learned from the second console. The second DVP incorporated a second surgeon into the operation, Dr. Jeff Collins, a urologist from Australia, assisted Dr. Patel throughout the operation from the second console. The US, European, and Asian audiences observed with several described as a paradigm shifting approach to robotic training as well as an interesting new multi-surgeon approach in the management of very complex surgical procedures. The commentary from the surgeons also included very positive reviews on Si’s next generation vision system, enhanced motion scaling, and expanded user interfaces. All in all, it was a very positive launch for what we believe to be an exciting new product offering in Intuitive Surgical’s product line. In the January edition, The Journal of Robotic Surgery, a publication from a urology group out of Korea led by Dr. Sung entitled the halo effect in Korea, change in practice patterns since the introduction of robotic assisted radical prostatectomy highlighted an interesting phenomenon taking place in urology centers around the world. We’ve often discussed the expansion of the hospitals’ prostatectomy business following the initiation of the da Vinci program, but I don’t recall it being detailed this clearly with empirical evidence in a peer review publication. This analysis tracked the relationship between three variables; open prostatectomy, da Vinci prostatectomy, and overall prostatectomies performed over a 33-month period beginning in July of 2005. The numbers were as follows: 663 prostatectomies were performed; 274 or 41.3% were performed with open surgery and 389 or 58.7% were performed with da Vinci. The evolution of the distribution is what’s noteworthy about the analysis. During the first three months of their study, 92% of the prostatectomies were performed using open technique compared to 8% with da Vinci. At the end of their study, 23% were performed with open surgery compared to 77% with da Vinci. What surprised the authors most was the overall growth of their prostate business during this period. During the 33-month period, total prostatectomy volume had grown from an average of 25 cases per quarter to an average of 103 cases per quarter, and all of this growth came by way of da Vinci. Da Vinci procedures had grown from 2 procedures per quarter to 79 procedures per quarter while open prostatectomy remained flat. Their prostatectomy business quadruple and all of the growth was DVP. There are a couple of theories as to why this was; first, a consolidation of prostate cancer patients within their particular geography, and second, a conversion of patients as well away from other potential prostate cancer therapies. It is always challenging to capture how much growth came from which bucket but I believe it’s fair to assume that both are taking place and not just in Korea. The authors concluded their publication with the following quote: “It seems that the next generation of surgical innovation has arrived in the form of the predominant telerobotic surgical system, the da Vinci surgical system, which may become the gold standard technique for the management of localized prostate cancer in the near future.” Once again, da Vinci partial nephrectomy was among our fastest growing procedures quarter-over-quarter. The clinical advantages of da Vinci partial nephrectomy over conventional laparoscopy and open surgery are being discussed more frequently at various urologic conferences, and the data pools are beginning to form. At this year’s Pan American Robotic Oncologic Symposium or PAROS, Dr. Sam Bhayani, a leading renal cancer surgeon from Washington University in St. Louis presented multi-institutional data comparing warm ischemic time between da Vinci partial nephrectomy and conventional laparoscopy for both simple and complex disease. The importance of reestablishing blood circulation through the kidney as rapidly and efficiently as possible is an important determinant to the kidney’s long-term function. Reducing warm ischemic time is of paramount importance to all involved. In Dr. Bhayani’s presentation, he showed that in simple partial nephrectomy where the tumor is not invading the collection system, warm ischemic time for da Vinci cases was 15.3 minutes which compared to conventional laparoscopy of 25.2 minute warm ischemic time, but in the cohort of complex invading tumors, the warm ischemic time within the da Vinci cases averaged 25.9 minutes which compared to 36.7 minutes for conventional laparoscopy. The average blood loss was similar within the simple cohorts, but within the complex cohorts, da Vinci patients experienced approximately 30% less blood loss. The dissemination and adaptation of improved clinical technique, training, and new instrument enhancements should help improve these important metrics even further. This year’s annual Society of Gyn/Oncology Conference included several clinical outcomes and surgical technique presentations on da Vinci hysterectomy. Most of these presentations concerned both cervical and endometrial cancer. One of the more interesting presentations was an actual cost comparison between da Vinci hysterectomy and conventional laparoscopy for endometrial cancer staging. Some among the advanced laparoscopic community have expressed opinions relating to a potential cost disparity between conventional laparoscopy performed by skilled laparoscopists to that of the da Vinci hysterectomy. Dr. Rabbie Hanna and the team from the University of North Carolina set out to compare for themselves. They presented the economic findings from 147 hysterectomies performed for endometrial cancer. Their study compared the average cost from 81 da Vinci hysterectomies to 66 of their conventional laparoscopic hysterectomies itemizing various costs which included instruments, anesthesia, PACU, boarding, lab, pharmacy, and operative cost. The overall difference between each of these sub-categories was pretty insignificant and the overall cost difference was also insignificant. In fact, the da Vinci hysterectomy cohort was actually on average $53 less per procedure than the conventional hysterectomies at their facility. When you factor in the reduction in da Vinci hysterectomy complications which this group has reported on in various publications in the past, the reasons to use da Vinci become even clear. This concludes my summary, and I’ll now turn the time over to Ben.
Benjamin Gong: I will be providing an update on our forecast for 2009 based on our results in Q1. First, as outlined by Marshall earlier, we expect that $20 million of revenue we deferred in Q1 to be recognized starting in the second quarter and completely recognized by the end of 2009. As a result, this should have no impact on our revenue for the year. Moving on to procedures, our procedure growth has been stronger than we previously expected. Procedures grew approximately 60% in the first quarter consistent with our procedure for all of 2008. As a result, we expect procedures to grow more than 40% this year compared with our previous forecast of 3% to 40%. Procedure growth will continue to drive significant growth in our total instrument and accessory revenues this year. However, stocking orders which are tied to new system sales are likely to fluctuate in the near term. In addition, as we saw in Q1, our customers ordering patterns could cause some fluctuations in our revenues per procedure. While our revenues per procedure have normalized over time, we could see increases or decreases on a quarterly basis this year. Previously, we forecasted 25% to 30% revenue growth in our instrument and accessory revenues. Although we expect procedures to grow more than we previously forecast, we are less certain that we will achieve this revenue forecast. At this time, we are suspending our previous guidance for instrument and accessory growth. When we gain better visibility, we plan to resume providing you with a revenue forecast for instruments and accessories. We would like to emphasize that in the longer term, instrument and accessory revenue growth should more closely match our growth in procedures. While procedures drive our revenue growth in the short-term, the environment for hospital capital spending remains highly uncertain and difficult to predict. As an example, we sold approximately 10% fewer systems in the first quarter than we previously expected. Last quarter, we forecasted flat system sales for the year. Although demand for systems continues to be strong, we are suspending guidance for systems revenue. Once again, when we gain better visibility, we plan to resume providing you with the revenue forecast for systems. Our service revenue model has been very consistent and we expect it to remain as it has in the past. We are generating an average of about $140 in service revenue per system per year. Since our service revenue was driven largely by the installed base, we continue to expect service revenue to grow approximately 35% this year. With regard to gross margin, it should be noted that we did not defer any cost of sales along with the $20 million revenue deferral in Q1. Therefore, when the deferred revenue is recognized in the ensuring quarters this year, it will result in increased gross margin. For the year, the deferral should have no net impact. We continue to expect our gross margin for the year to come in between 70% and 71%. With regard to operating expense, last quarter we provided a forecast of growing our GAAP operating expense by approximately 20% in 2009. Based on our current plans for the remainder of the year, we expect our GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 17% from 2008 to 2009. Included in this estimate are some significant increases in non-cash expenses. First, with regard to SFAS 123R, in 2008 we recorded $77 million stock compensation expense. In 2009, we expect stock compensation expense to increase 24% to approximately $95 million. Secondly, with regard to IP amortization charges, we are scheduled to record approximately $16 million in the R&D expense line for 2009, up 60% from the $10 million we recorded in 2008. We will continue to manage our fixed cost closely as we demonstrated in Q4 and Q1, however, we will continue to add resources in the sales and R&D functions as we view these as important investments to continue driving growth in the near term and the long term. With regard to income tax, the tax adjustment related to changes in state tax laws that impacted our Q1 tax rate is not expected to recur in the balance of the year. Going forward in 2009, we expect to report a GAAP tax rate of approximately 40%. For calculating earnings per share, we ended the quarter with 37.9 million shares outstanding after buying back and returning approximately 1.4 million shares through our accelerated buy-back program. We will complete the accelerated buy-back by the middle of June though the number of additional shares we receive under the program will be small compared with the 1.4 million already received. Approximately 500,000 shares were added to the diluted share count for calculating EPS in Q1. Therefore we expect our share count for calculating EPS in Q2 to be approximately 38.4 million shares. Finally, when analyzing and forecasting our cash flows, it is important to note that while we reported net income of approximately $28 million in Q1, we generated approximately $90 million in cash from operations during the first quarter. The $20 million revenue deferral causes significant part of this difference, and the larger contributor to the difference was our recording of approximately $23 million of SFAS 123R stock compensation expense, and we expect to continue to record approximately $24 million per quarter for the rest of the year. As a result, our cash flow should continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). The first question is from the line of David Lewis - Morgan Stanley.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : I’ll try to limit this to just a few questions; first of all, may be just if you could talk us through thematically the decision to suspend guidance, were these the things you learned incrementally into the first quarter with the difficulty in filling boxes in the first quarter that led you to this or simply the operating environment got less physical materially in the last 6 weeks, so there’s too many factors to control for and so suspension of guidance seems most prudent?
Marshall L. Mohr:  I think you’re on to it David. Given the current environment, our visibility in the system sales is not very good, and this was evidenced in the first quarter where we missed our system forecast by about 10%; so rather than give you guidance that has a high degree of uncertainty, we’re just going to suspend guidance at this time, and when visibility improves, we plan to resume giving you guidance.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley:  Would you say this means that your visibility from 3 months ago is better, worse, or the same?
Marshall L. Mohr:  It’s probably relatively the same.
Aleks Cukic:  I actually think it might be a little bit better. Actually, in terms of just the range of what could have happened, I think that we performed quite well, but if we were to give guidance, it would be such a wide range it might not be very meaningful, so we decided let’s see what happens, and as we get further down this path where we will be more confident in our ability to forecast, we will be willing to do so.
Benjamin Gong:  Just to add one point, David, is that, as you know we manage a pipeline and we work on a lot of different deals which become difficult as not knowing what deals you’re working on but trying to predict the demand and reconciling it to when it is going to close, and predicting that within 90-day windows became very hard, but again, working on a lot of systems is something that we continue to do.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley:  Okay, just a couple more questions; just on instruments specifically, would you say that more of the variability is tied to the pricing and mix issues than we talked about last year or is this more not understanding the inventory in that channel with customers today?
Marshall L. Mohr:  For changes that happened pretty rapidly like Q4 to Q1, the things I can move the fastest or things like changes in stocking orders which we definitely saw and also changes in, let’s say, customers managing their inventory; the things that we talked about before like efficiencies and procedure mix, those are things that gradually impact the revenue per procedure over longer periods of time.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley:  And then just last question, I want to kind of get back to the deferral of revenue; if Marshall can provide with some detail on how many customers were affected by the deferral in this quarter, so how many specific upgrades, and then how many were actually affected by the specific accessory upgrade?
Marshall L. Mohr:  This was a program that we developed in order to make sure we were being fair to customers that were buying da Vinci S in the quarter just before we introduced the new product, and so, when you say how many customers were affected, we effectively offered all customers of the S the opportunity to upgrade. Now the accounting rules are kind of convoluted and they basically require us then to defer the amount of discount that we’re offering them to buy the upgrade at and the discount being that from list price, but we made the offer so that effectively if they bought an S, the amount they’ll have to pay to get to the Si equivalent is equal to what we would have sold an Si for.
Benjamin Gong: 
, :
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: That’s actually very very helpful. Lastly, and I’ll jump back in queue and let someone else take a crack here; in terms of the timing of this system, you’ve launched new systems before at various times during the quarter. I’m just curious as to we have seen a significant deferral program before. So, was the economic sensitivity tied to the specific timing or nature of this program or were they unrelated.
Benjamin Gong: Really again, what we’re trying to do is to be fair to customers who are buying a da Vinci S. So, the timing is unrelated. It had to do with upfront thinking about the rollout program and what made sense.
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: The other thing is the last major larger product launch was standard da Vinci to da Vinci S. Those two were not compatible in terms of an upgrade; that would have been missing. In other words, the S can be upgraded to the Si. The standard could not be upgraded to the S.
Marshall L. Mohr: We also learned from that experience with S that we had a few very unhappy customers and the accounting rules because of the way we treat it did not allow us to talk with them for 6 months to even communicate anything, and that’s just not the way to run a business. Long-term, these are our customers. We would all be happy and want to treat them as we would want to be treated, and so we’ve restructured this and taken the hit in this quarter because we believe long-term we’ll have a better relationship with those customers than if we treated as we did with the S.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: How long does it take to upgrade an S system? You guys had mentioned anywhere between 2Q and the rest of ’09 you’ll get a decision. Is it relatively quick? Is it mostly software?
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: I’ll first of all make clear that the offer is valid till the end of June. So they have till the end of June to decide whether they want to be upgraded.
Marshall L. Mohr: Gary, glad you answered this. It’s both software and hardware.
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: In terms of physically what it is, it’s a fair amount of hardware as well as the software that goes in it and physically it is half a day, an afternoon.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Basically all of the S out there could potentially be upgraded; do you have a number roughly of how many of S out there that could be upgraded?
Marshall L. Mohr: Of the 1171 systems that are out there, I think over 700 of them are the S variety.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Just to be clear; in terms of on a go-forward basis, you don’t target to have anymore of the deferred revenues? So, this offer is only for Q1 customers and not for Q2 or anything like that?
Marshall L. Mohr: Correct.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Last question, you provided a little bit of insight into your thinking around the single incision. Gary, I was wondering if you could maybe flush that out. Are there are milestones, timing of when something like that could become more visible out of Intuitive?
Marshall L. Mohr: I guess I’d say we’ll share with you as we progress where we are. Right now we’re in the early phases. We’re looking closely at both the technology and the IT required to do it, and that work progresses and there is an appropriate milestone, we’ll let you know.
Lonnie M. Smith: By policy we do not pre-announce products and nor would we start.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Yes, I was just trying to get a sense of where it was and the progress. Last question this time; I know you’re not providing full year guidance because of the visibility, but Ben, any trends heading into the second quarter that might be helpful for us?
Benjamin Gong: I think the best data point we have is that we just sold 66 systems in Q1 and again that was down by about 10% from Q1 of last year, and I know there is a wide range out there of forecasts and some people were thinking that we do quite a few less than that. Some people thought it would be more. We were hoping for more, but I think that’s probably our best data point at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mimi Pham - JMP Securities.
Mimi Pham - JMP Securities: Can you just clarify that in the 66 systems for first quarter none of these are double-counted right? I mean, if there was someone who bought an S in the first quarter and then upgraded to an Si, do they count twice or all of these were…
Lonnie M. Smith: We sold 66 systems in Q1. We announced the Si after Q1 was over. So, there’s no overlap or double counting, and just to reiterate what Marshall said, we did the launch with the plan of going back to those Q1 customers who just purchased to give them an offer to upgrade so that they could feel like they were given the opportunity to buy Si if they could.
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: Mimi, to answer your question, no there was no double counting and nor will it be when we upgrade, we will not count that as an additional system. We’ll count it as an upgrade.
Mimi Pham - JMP Securities: Thank you so much for that clarification. I know you’re not giving guidance, but in terms of what we normally see for your guidance for the first quarter, whatever you do in first quarter for system sales, we generally see a better number second and third quarter and then a better number than that in the fourth quarter. Is that what you expect to see or is there a risk just given what we’re seeing in the environment even though second quarters being sequentially lower than first quarters?
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: I think what we can say is you’re right. The seasonality that we’ve seen in the past is that the second quarter is typically up from the first quarter, and by the way for service revenues and instrument accessory revenues, you’re going to expect some sequential growth. With system revenues, there’s less certainty there. All things being equal, you’d expect sequential growth, but we don’t have enough visibility to make that call at this time.
Lonnie M. Smith: It gets right back down to the pipeline. It’s the point that Aleks made earlier and we made it actually on the last call. You get right down to the last signature and somebody decides not to do it because of concern for the current financial situation. On the other hand, the economy if it does get better and people gain some confidence, then perhaps that’ll be a positive. So, it just depends on what happens in the environment.
Marshall L. Mohr: We overlay it all. Demand comes from really three areas. You’ve got procedure demand, you’ve got physician demand to deliver those procedures, and you have hospital demand to build robotic initiatives. The demand is strong in all of those universes. The challenge is converting the last one to an actual sale in a predictable time period, but the sales people are very active, and as you can tell by global procedure expansion during Q1 probably the most important component is well intact and that is the procedure demand.
Mimi Pham - JMP Securities: I guess you addressed this a little bit on the last question, but in terms of the international markets, are you seeing less visibility in there in terms of delays hitting their CapEx purchase decisions more than what you’d seen in the fourth quarter?
Marshall L. Mohr: Again, as we sometimes mention on these calls is that it’s really hard to give a single answer for the international market because Europe is made up on 26 markets and Asia is made up of a number and the Americas, etc., but again, when I look across the board, across Europe into Belgium, Denmark, France, and Germany, their procedure numbers were exceptionally strong. If I look at Korea, Canada, and Brazil in our OUS distribution market, very very strong, and even the distribution within Europe, be it Romania, Turkey, and what not. So, in general, each country is a little bit different and each region is different. Q1 we sold 22 systems and our procedure growth was exceptional. I think it was a very good performance.
Mimi Pham - JMP Securities: Last question; we’ve heard a feedback that the Si is really a great tool for teaching hospitals. Can you let us know how many of your customers in US are teaching hospitals that might be the best candidates for the Si upgrade?
Marshall L. Mohr: I can’t give you the exact number of customers, but I can tell you that less than 2% of the US hospitals are academic medical centers, which is approximately 150 medical schools across the United States, but when you then add in the caveat of teaching, we have teaching centers that are not university based that are very large community hospitals or large active community hospitals that can be teaching centers for us. So, it isn’t as clean an answer to say or I can’t give you a much cleaner answer. There are a number of center and there are a number of academic hospitals that have residency programs, and I think your reconnaissance is accurate. I think it changes the potential paradigm for how robotic training can go forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co.: Just following up on the time to close question; can you characterize the magnitude of the change. I mean, if you missed by 10%, can we extrapolate that and we’re still getting to closing, but 10% slower, and like you said, the pipeline is still quite full. So, over the course of several quarters you should see those same orders come back through. Is that the way you’re looking at it?
Lonnie M. Smith: In Q1 we got some of the orders that were postponed in Q4 and as you might expect you have people that are taking longer to make some of those decisions and that’s what is causing some of the uncertainty and when these things are closing. I am not sure you can do a straight extrapolation that says 10% down is going to be where it’s going to be for the rest of the year, but that’s what we see so far.
Marshall L. Mohr: I guess it’s a trend that will turn around, when we get these; we only believe we will get them, we just don’t know when. We think longer term as the economy stabilizes a little bit, I don’t think it’ll get it back to where it was, but as it normalizes, then the confidence will build and people will buy those if the capital freezes on at this point in time.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co.: If we can talk a little bit more about the upgrade; the Si, is there only one variety of upgrade or can somebody take the functional upgrade without the training console?
Lonnie M. Smith: I think I sense a little bit of confusion; this is a new system version that’s called the Si, and you can upgrade from the S to the Si. So we didn’t launch just an upgrade, we launched a new system, and you can actually convert the S to the Si.
Marshall L. Mohr: But the second console is available as an option. So, you convert the base system from S to Si and then you can buy the second console as your additional. The second console is not necessarily part of the upgrade.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co.: Understand. So, the upgrade costs would be the $600,000 that you mentioned; the list price?
Marshall L. Mohr: Correct.
Lonnie M. Smith: The list price of a new system with a single console is $1.7 million and the list price of a second console is $500,000.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co.: So, the Si will essentially replace the S as your top of the line product. Will you continue selling the S or does that get discontinued?
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: That’s a good question. We will continue to see both S and Si and we expect to sell the S version for quite some time.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co.: As you think about the customers that purchased the S before the first quarter there might be some grumpiness there too in terms of the relative near-term nature of the upgrade. Have you thought through offering some of those customers upgrades at some sort of a discount and is there a systematic process to go back to them or are you forbidden under the 6-month rule of doing them?
Marshall L. Mohr: We’ll try not to let the accounting rules dictate everything we do, but we will try to work with each of our customers, the people who bought maybe in Q4 or in 2007 and work with them as best as we can.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co.: You meant 2008 of course?
Marshall L. Mohr: Yes, and the ones in 2007.
Lonnie M. Smith: We’ll work with all upgrades.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co.: Last question on the instrument pull-through; there is a question relative to the revenues relative to the procedure volumes and you’ve characterized some of the different dynamics there, some of them move more quickly than others; how much movement has there in been in hospitals relative to that gain of efficiency. So, trying to tease out that effect of somebody using fewer instruments per case if you will or being more efficient with how they use these expensive instruments.
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: I think when you think of efficiencies even, there are some subcomponents of efficiencies. For example, if you look at a hospital’s inventory system, they may have a few instruments in the operating room, they may have central storage, they may have a couple of different places to make sure they do not have to cancel a case because they’re missing one key instrument. That sort of par level setting and managing of inventory is a pretty natural progression through just about any medical device technology I’ve been associated with for a long time, and so I think that’s one component. The other is surgeons becoming more efficacious with the instruments used in the operation. I think that tends to mere procedure efficacy more than it does, “how do I get $200 out of this case?” and so when we talk about stocking orders we are often referring to the initial system purchase and the instruments that come with it. When we talk about efficiencies, it can be in the management of inventory within the hospital and then there are certainly components which we totally expect as we become more readily used in simple procedures and that’s the instrument mix in the actual procedure.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co.: So that combined with the procedure mix because obviously a prostatectomy might use a different number of instruments or cost of instruments than say a hysterectomy?
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: Yes, and I would point to the area and I think we called this out in one of the previous calls that some of the nine gynecologic procedures can perhaps consume fewer instruments and we’re perfectly happy about that because as we go into these simple cohort of procedures, the volumes are significantly larger and I think moving into that is a very positive thing. We might rather have three instruments or four instruments in a universe of significantly large procedures than we would to have five instrument procedures in relatively smaller universes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Ricci - Wachovia Capital Markets.
Vincent Ricci - Wachovia Capital Markets: Just a couple of quick question. You guys were really good about explaining this, but I just want to make this abundantly clear; 66 systems were physically placed in the quarter; is that correct, that actually installed?
Marshall L. Mohr: That’s correct.
Vincent Ricci - Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay, and did you recognize the cost of goods sold on this system and that’s why it’s basically $20.1 million in deferred operating income?
Marshall L. Mohr: That’s correct. We did not defer any cost along with the $20 million of revenue.
Vincent Ricci - Wachovia Capital Markets: On your deferred revenue entry on the balance sheet, that’s predominantly your service contracts, but can you just go into it a little bit; do you have orders that someone signed, or the inflation doesn’t slip; how did that work, can you just walk us through that a little bit?
Marshall L. Mohr: What’s in deferred revenue and the balance sheet right now is pretty much the prepaid service contracts and the $18 million of deferred revenue associated with this deferral we just did.
Vincent Ricci - Wachovia Capital Markets: Can you just give us quickly the international and domestic breakup?
Lonnie M. Smith: For the quarter or for the installed base or both?
Vincent Ricci - Wachovia Capital Markets: For the quarter and specifically just overall revenues?
Marshall L. Mohr: The system placements we sold 17 in Europe and 5 in rest of world markets. The revenue I’ll let Ben answer.
Benjamin Gong: It was roughly 75% of our revenues in the US and 25% international.
Vincent Ricci - Wachovia Capital Markets: A quick question on the stuff you guys are working on. I realize you don’t talk about anything in advance, but you have mentioned that you picked up the IP from Power Medical. Can you talk to us a little bit about where you guys are with the surgical stapler?
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: We’re in the process here of development. So far, so good.
Vincent Ricci - Wachovia Capital Markets: Lastly, with the standard system, is that something you’re still selling or is that something you guys are going to phase out over time?
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: We sold standard systems during Q1 and now that it’s maybe a couple of generations older than the latest one, it will probably decrease in terms of the number of these that will sell going forward.
Lonnie M. Smith: But we’re not manufacturing standard systems any longer. We do take them back as trade-ins, we refurbish them and sell them to those people who are looking for a low-price system, who are still willing to use the instruments and they will still do the job, they just don’t do it quite as well as the newer systems.
Vincent Ricci - Wachovia Capital Markets: I realize this is not a large part of your national sales right now, but can you tell us what you’re seeing with the emerging market particularly with the currency movements that have happened?
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: It’s a good question. I don’t know if you call this an emerging market, but in Korea the Korean won has definitely gotten weaker versus the US dollar and in places like that it’s more difficult for those guys to purchase systems and we actually did not sell any in Korea in Q1.
Vincent Ricci - Wachovia Capital Markets: I’ll just make this my last question because I’ve taken up a lot of time. Can you just talk to us a little bit about, you’ve been talking about the de-stocking at hospitals, but can you talk to us a little about any distributors you have, say in Europe and what not. Do you have stocking distributors in Europe and is that an issue potentially?
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: There are normal fluctuations in the buying patterns of our European folks. We did actually do one thing. We took the UK direct; there was distribution up to the end of last year and starting at the beginning of this year, we took it direct. So, there’s a little bit of transition there. It didn’t have a material impact on the quarter’s results.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan.
Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan: Just starting, I was wondering on the market opportunity for the Si and I appreciate the color on the mix in some of the discussion on DVP and DVH, but are you anticipating a similar kind of procedure mix, and then can you just talk a little bit about how you’re viewing the Greenfield versus upgrade opportunity and maybe with that in mind talk a little bit about some of these deferred orders too if that mirrors the kind of existing mix; I know it’s a lot of points, but if you could just elaborate, that would be helpful.
Marshall L. Mohr: I’ll take a shot at some of those. Greenfield versus…
Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan: If we think about installed base for maybe over the next 12 months for Si; how many of these systems do you anticipate going to new customers versus upgrading your existing installed base?
Marshall L. Mohr: We’ll certainly continue to see to new customer. In Q1, it was a fairly high mix of sales to the existing customers and that can also be a factor of the environment where it’s in a tougher buying environment, the folks would know exactly what they’re getting. Existing customers are more likely to make a decision quicker than some of the ones who don’t, and we may see that continue.
Aleks Cukic: I think that that’s a testament to the value of the system. Actually, those who have it see the value, they see the revenue it brings, and they’re investing heavily in it, and it’s made a priority investment for them, and so they continue to buy because it’s an opportunity for them to take part in care and build revenue.
Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan: What you talked about on the deferred revenues; does that mirror the mix you’ve been seeing with the Greenfield versus the upgrades?
Marshall L. Mohr: I believe they’re disconnected in that the deferred has to do with the 44 accounts that purchased in Q1. So when you look at the overall mix of Greenfield versus second systems in Q1 out of the 60 net new systems, 17 were to existing customers. If you look at it including the trade-off transactions, that numbers grows to 23 and most of those were in the United States.
Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan: That’s what I was getting at. Have you done a global upgrade; you talked about 44 customer offers for the upgrade which mirrors the US numbers.
Marshall L. Mohr: Of the 44 systems that were impacted, 8 of them were international and the other ones were in the United States. So, we made offers internationally as well.
Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan: On service; I guess as it would seem in this environment, it’s going to go up a little bit, both as a function of long utilization and the upgrade path, and you talked about not having a change in your outlook there. Can you just comment as to why that’s not picking up a little bit in this environment or a little bit more beyond what you previously expected?
Aleks Cukic: Remember, service is just the ongoing annual fee that we collect from the installed base. So, there are 1171 systems out there and the reason why the service revenue is not fluctuating too much is that most of the service revenue comes from the installed base and it’ll go up as we install new systems, but in proportion to the installed base, the new systems will be a small percentage, and that’s why you don’t see too much fluctuation of service revenues with fluctuations in new system placements this year.
Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan: You’ve talked in the past about leasing picking up a little bit and I think you said last quarter that you weren’t expecting to really expand that program, but any views in light of the current environment as to how you’re looking at that?
Marshall L. Mohr: We’ll answer this one last question Tycho. On leasing, it has been relatively the same; 15% to 20% of our sales in Q1 were leases and they were actually across six different leasing sources, but there continues to be no shortage of leasing available to our customers.
Benjamin Gong: We’ll take one last question.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Ed Shenkan - Needham & Co.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Co.: Wanted to ask you, on calculating ASPs, maybe you can help me because if I take $1.33 million per system times 60 new systems, I get $79.8 million which is $10 million more than you reported for systems. How do you do the calculation? What am I missing?
Marshall L. Mohr: It’s really straightforward; take the system revenue, add $18 million to it, and then divide that by 66, and you’ll get the ASP of about $1.33 million and it’s about the same or exactly the same as it was in Q4, it’s almost the same as it was in Q1 of last year.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Co.: What’s the ASP going forward for the S robots; the Si you said is $1.75 million; and maybe if you could break it out, US and OUS for the S going forward?
Marshall L. Mohr: Average selling prices given the launch of the Si at a higher price and the fact that you can buy it with the feature of a second console could cause our ASPs to go up going forward. As you know, the product mix and the geography mix will have impacts on that on a quarterly basis, but just given the fact that we’ve got a new product out here with a higher price could cause our ASPs to increase.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Co.: What would the ASP for the S be going forward? Where it has been if you’re down and where should it be?
Marshall L. Mohr: We’ll see.
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: The list price is staying where it’s at.
Marshall L. Mohr: The list price is staying exactly where it’s at.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Co.: Did you have to discount it at all in the first quarter?
Marshall L. Mohr: I think the ASP is indicative of where our pricing has been and continues to be. Pricing was pretty consistent with where it was in Q4 of last year and Q1 of last year.
Dr. Gary S. Guthart:  Less the service component.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Co.: Last question; is it fair to say then that outside the US per selling system you haven’t seen the weakness even close to what we’ve seen in the US impacting your businesses, is that right?
Dr. Gary S. Guthart: Again, I would hedge back on earlier comments. It varies by country, it really does. Some countries that you have seen systems sold in the past you did not see this quarter and you’ve seen a lot of strength for example out of Korea for some period of time, Germany is picking up strength and the last few quarters has been very strong, Italy has been strong for a long time, but it’s going to vary country by country. At the end of the day, 22 systems from outside the United States were sold in Q1 which was I believe was two more than last year. So, the system placements were actually higher on a year-over-year basis internationally and roughly 10% lower in the United States.
Lonnie M. Smith:  As I’ve said previously, while we focus on the financial metrics which is revenues, profits, and cash flow during this conference call, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I have been following three patient experiences to give you some sense of what that means in the lives of our patients. The first patient is a 12-year-old girl who was diagnosed with double uterus. When she first began menstruating, she experienced excessive pain, she went to the local hospital at Student Health where excess blood was drained from her non-functioning uterus and the incision closed. She continued to experience extraordinary pain, was seen by a doctor in Miami, Florida. He recognized the anatomical abnormality and the second uterus without the vaginal outlet. He drained 1.5 liters of trapped blood from the redundant isolated right uterus and performed a hysterectomy on that uterus, the right fallopian tube and the right ovary and eventually she left in less than 24 hours after the surgery with minimal pain and resumed to her life as an active 12-year-old. The second patient is the wife of a member of our marketing team who was diagnosed with uterine fibroids. She had a myomectomy performed by a doctor at the University of Maryland. She was treated as an outpatient, returned to the hotel 10 hours after entering the hospital, had dinner with her husband, and went shopping at the mall the next day. The last patient is from Illinois who personally had undergone two da Vinci surgical procedures. On February of 2007, the patient underwent a da Vinci prostatectomy performed by a doctor at the University of Chicago. He was discharged in 24 hours and says he walked out of the medical center, went home, and mowed his lawn the next day. Less than a year later, however, he was diagnosed with a couple blocked arteries and he needed a coronary artery bypass which required a full sternotomy followed by an extended recovery period of 1 month or more. He said that he decided right then and there that he didn’t want anything to do with open chest surgery, he drove home, got on the internet, and learned that he could have a da Vinci surgery for his heart as well. Four days following the double bypass performed by Dr. Srivastava at the University of Chicago, he walked out of the medical center, went home, and played ball with his grandson. Patients like these are strongest advocates for surgery with the da Vinci system and are the very foundation of our operating performance. In closing, I assure you that we remain committed to focusing on the vital few things that truly make a difference as we strive to take surgery beyond the limit of the human hands. This concludes our call today. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.
Operator:  Thank you for participating in today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

(Operator Instructions). Now I would like to introduce your host for today's call Mr. Ben Gong, Vice President of Finance. 
Benjamin Gong: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's fourth quarter conference call. With me today, we have Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO; Gary Guthart, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer; Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Strategic Planning. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at www.intuitivesurgical.com on the audio archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. First, Lonnie will present the quarter's business highlights. Marshall will follow with a review of our fourth quarter and annual financial results. Next, Aleks will discuss sales and marketing highlights, then I'll provide our financial forecast for 2009 and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'd like to introduce Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO.
Lonnie M. Smith: Thank you for joining us today. Operating highlights for the fourth quarter are as follows. Procedures grew 61% over the fourth quarter of 2007. We sold 85 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 78 during the fourth quarter of last year. Our international team had an excellent quarter contributing 30 of the 85 systems sold. We ended the fourth quarter with 1111 da Vinci systems installed worldwide. Total revenue for the quarter was up 22% from last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to 82 million, up 45%. Total reoccurring revenue including service grew to $118 million, up 46% from the prior year, comprising 51% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $104 million before non-cash 123R stock option expense, up 25% from the fourth quarter of last year, and GAAP net income grew to $51 million, up 3% from last year.  During the full year 2008, procedures grew by 60% over 2007. We sold 335 da Vinci surgical systems, up 39% from prior year. Total revenue grew to $875 million, up 46%. Reoccurring revenue grew to 420 million, up 52%, comprising 48% of total revenue. We generated $387 million in operating profit before non-cash 123R stock option expense, up 59% from last year, and GAAP net income grew to $204 million, up 41%. We ended the year with $902 million in cash and investments, up $80 million from last quarter, and $266 million from last year. Excluding $45 million in cash received from the exercise of stock options and adding back $116 million invested in intellectual property, working capital, and property, plant, and equipment during the year, we generated $338 million in cash from operations before operating investments of $8.46 per fully diluted share and 165% of our reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of significant non-cash stock option and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason we continue to believe that operating profit before non-cash 123R stock option expense remains the best measure of our actual financial performance.  Adoption of surgical robotics is procedure specific and patient driven. We continue to drive the adoption curve for robotically assisted surgery procedure by procedure. Some of our highest growth procedures of 2008 defined as greater than 100% year over year growth include nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy, gastrectomy, radial cystectomy, hysterectomy, sacral colpopexy, thyroidectomy, and colon and rectal resections. I should note that our gastrectomy and thyroidectomy procedures are concentrated in Asia. While some of these procedures are measured off a relatively small number in the prior year, we have learned from past experience that these are usually stages of new adoption curves. We continue to make significant progress in terms of innovation and efficiency in every area of our business. Some 2008 data points you might find of interest include we added 285 new employees during the year, ending the year with 1049 employees. Revenue per employee grew to $965,000 in 2008 compared with $905,000 in 2007, and instrument and accessory revenue per system was up 6.6% to $322,000 from $302,000 in 2007. With that, I’ll pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall L. Mohr : As previously announced, total fourth quarter revenue of $232 million increased 22% compared with $189 million for the fourth quarter 2007, and decreased 2% compared with $236 million for the third quarter of 2008. Procedures for the fourth quarter increased 61%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2007 and 15% sequentially. DVP and DVH growth was as expected.  Fourth quarter revenues by product category were as follows: Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $82 million, up 45% compared with $56 million last year and up 7% compared with $76 million last quarter. The growth rate in instruments and accessories is the direct result of our procedure growth rates. Procedure growth rates increased more than instrument and accessory revenue reflecting lower stocking orders associated with fewer systems placed, procedure mix, strengthening of the dollar and surgery efficiency. The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $2000 per procedures. Systems revenue of $114 million increased 5% compared with $108 million last year and decreased 10% compared with $126 million last quarter. The decrease in systems revenue compared with the third quarter of 2008 reflects decreased unit sales, as well as a decrease in the average revenue per system. Fourth quarter da Vinci Surgical Systems revenue reflects the sale of 85 systems compared with 78 systems sold in during the fourth quarter of last year, and 91 systems sold in the third quarter. The decrease in systems sold reflects reduced hospital capital spending as a result of the economic and financial market issues. 66 of the systems sold during the quarter were our latest S model incorporating high definition vision capabilities. 10 were four-arm S models incorporating standard vision capabilities. Four were three-arm S models, and five were refurbished standard systems. Six of the systems in the quarter involved trade-ins. Our fourth quarter average revenue per system, including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades, was $1.32 million which is 50,000 less than the average revenue per system in the third quarter of 2008. The lower average revenue per system primarily reflects changes in product and geographical mix and the strengthening of the dollar. Service revenue increased to $36 million, up 46% compared with $25 million last year and up 7% compared with $34 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total third quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $118 million, up 46% compared with the fourth quarter of 2007 and up 6% compared with the third quarter of 2008. Recurring revenue represented 51% of total revenue in the fourth quarter compared with 46% in the third quarter of 2008. Revenue outside the United States represented 27% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 19% of total third quarter revenue. International procedures and revenue increased from a seasonally low third quarter. We sold 30 systems outside of the US this quarter compared with 20 in the third quarter, a 50% increase despite the global economic downturn. Our fourth quarter 2008 gross margin of 71.4% was similar to the 71.9% realized in the third quarter. Lower average selling prices for systems and effects of the strengthening dollar were partially offset by lower operating costs and material cost reductions.  We opened our Mexico facility in July which is now responsible for nearly half of our instrument volume. Although we incur lower labor costs in Mexico, the overall savings in 2008 was mostly offset by manufacturing startup costs.  Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $83 million compared with $85 million in the third quarter of 2008. The sequential operating expense decrease of $2 million reflects decreased commissions associated with lower system sales, strengthening of the US dollar, decreases in outside services, and overall decreases in spending partially offset by increase headcount. In the fourth quarter, we purchased an additional facility in Sunnyvale which will be used for shipping and logistics beginning in February. We also postponed the construction of the new facility next our main campus for at least one year. These net changes will result in lower costs in 2009 than we otherwise would have incurred but did not impact the fourth quarter.  We added 36 employees during the fourth quarter ending the period with 1049 regular employees. The majority of these additions were to our worldwide clinical sales and engineering teams. Fourth quarter 2008 operating income was $83 million or 36% of sales, compared with $85 million or 36% of sales for the third quarter of 2008. We would like to point out that operating income includes 123R stock compensation and amortization charges associated with purchased IP. Both the third quarter and fourth quarter included $21 million of 123R stock compensation expenses. In the fourth quarter, it included $4 million of amortization of purchased IP compared to approximately $3 million in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter 2008 other income was $6 million, up $1 million from the third quarter, reflecting reduced exchange losses on euro accounts and higher interest on our increased investment balances. Given the recent volatility of the euro exchange rate, in January, we went into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our euro balances at December 31, 2008, and a portion of our expected revenue for the first 6 months of 2009. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 42.5% which is higher than the 37.8% recorded for the first nine months of the year. The increase in our rate reflects certain non-deductible costs partially offset by federal 2008 R&D credits. The non-deductible costs reflected in the fourth quarter rate included adjustments related to 2007 and the first nine months of 2008. The rate for all of 2008 was 39%. We continue to utilize carry forward tax benefits and employee stock related tax benefits in 2008, and expect out cash outlay for income taxes will be approximately 22% of pretax income for 2008. Our cash outlay estimate is slightly greater than our previous estimates given lower employee stock option exercises in the fourth quarter.  As a result of the delay in the IRS’s issuance of new regulations, we have postponed expenditures to implement the remainder of our tax structure. As a result, the GAAP benefits of our international tax structure will be delayed 1 year. However, in the meantime our cash outlays for tax will continue to benefit from the international structure.  Net income of $51 million or $1.27 per share increased 3% compared with $49 million or $1.24 per share for the fourth quarter of 2007 and decreased 12% compared with $58 million or $1.44 per share for the third quarter of 2008.  Let me quickly summarize our results for 2008. Total procedures grew 60% to approximately 136,000. Total systems sales grew 39% to 335 systems. Total revenue for 2008 was $878 million, up 46% compared with $601 million last year. Operating income for 2008 was $311 million, up 50% compared with $207 million last year. Operating income for 2008 was $311 million, up 50% compared with $207 million last year. Operating income included $77 million of stock base compensation changes and $10 million of IP amortization in 2008 compared with $36 million of stock-based compensation changes and $1 million of IP amortization in 2007. Net income for 2008 was $204 million or $5.12 per share, up 41% compared with $145 million or $3.70 per share last year. Cash and investments grew $266 million for the year to $902 million on December 31st. 
 : Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $170 million at December 31st, compared with $174 million at September 30, 2008. Despite the economic environment, collections have remained strong. Our net inventory increased to $63 million at December 31st compared with $52 million at September 30, 2008. The increase in inventory reflects lower than expected systems revenue. With that, I would like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing, and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic: During the third quarter, we sold 85 da Vinci systems, 55 in the United States, 23 in Europe, and 7 in rest of world markets. A total of six system sales were part of trade-up transactions. The net 79 new system installations brings to 1111 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 825 in the United States, 194 in Europe, and 92 in rest of world markets. Fourteen of the 79 net system installs during the quarter represented repeats systems to existing customers, which included fourth systems to both the Cleveland Clinic and Hartford Hospital and third systems to Cornell medical Center, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Scottsdale Healthcare, and Methodist Hospital in Rochester, Minnesoa. This brings to 131 the total number of customers which own two or more da Vinci systems. International sales were particularly strong and included 5 da Vinci placements into Germany and three into the countries of France, Italy, Korea, and Russia.  Clinically, we had an excellent quarter, with strong sequential procedure growth within our targeted surgical specialties, both domestic and internationally. Growth of da Vinci hysterectomy, both for benign and malignant conditions, sacral colpopexy, nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy and da Vinci prostatectomy were most notable.  In Q4 along, there were over 200 da Vinci related clinical publications within various peer reviewed journals, and the medical conference season was back in full swing. Case studies and serious presentations were plentiful during the quarter, but I will limit my review to only a few. At this year’s Association of Advanced Gynecologic Laparoscopy Conference or AAGL, the agenda included robotic postgraduate courses, robotic satellite symposia, and a very well attended robotic symposium. As you might suspect, clinical procedure discussions feature da Vinci hysterectomy for both benign and malignant conditions, da Vinci sacral colpopexy and da Vinci myomectomy. Consistent with GYN meeting reviews, surgeon’s report of lower blood loss, lower complications, shorter hospitalization, shorter learning curves versus laparoscopy, quicker returns to normal activity, and increased patient satisfaction were common themes. What resonates with me at this point in our GYN evolution is the positive impact that da Vinci is making in surgeon practice patterns and more specifically how da Vinci has helped to expand minimally invasive surgery treatment within a surgical specialty that is already believed to have a high penetration of minimally invasive surgery.  Dr. Gary Donovitz, a GYN surgeon practicing at USMD Hospital in Arlington, Texas delivered a presentation that compared his benign hysterectomy practice before and after his switch to da Vinci. Dr. Donovitz began performing DVH in early 2006, and he compared his pre-DVH practice of 2004 or 2005 to his post-DVH practice of 2006 and 2007. His pre-DVH statistics were as follows: Out of 175 overall hysterectomies, 11 were performed as total vaginal hysterectomies, 115 were total laparoscopic hysterectomies, and 49 were total abdominal hysterectomies.  As a highly skilled laparoscopist, his 28% abdominal incision rate was less than half the US average. In 2006 and 2007, post da Vinci, he performed a total of 188 hysterectomies, 4 were vaginal, 180 were DVH, and most importantly only 4 required the total abdominal approach. His already low 28% abdominal hysterectomy rate was reduced to 2%, meaning that after incorporating da Vinci into his practice, 98% of the women requiring a hysterectomy left the hospital without an abdominal incision, and 96% of these women received a da Vinci hysterectomy. Similarly, Dr. Angelo Maggioni, an accomplished GYN oncologist from Milan, Italy, delivered a presentation on 80 of his da Vinci endometrial cancer procedures at the International Gynecologic Oncology Robotic Symposium or IGRS where he stated, “we have experienced an 85% increase in minimally invasive surgical procedures in our practice due to robotics.” These examples not only speak to the changing GYN practice but more importantly they speak to the increased patient value that da Vinci is providing throughout the specialty of GYN surgery.  Over the past few quarters, we’ve discussed the uptake in da Vinci’s use within renal or kidney cancer surgery. As Lonnie mentioned earlier, the growth within da Vinci nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy globally was strong throughout the year. The renal surgery community has truly embraced to need to preserve as much healthy tissue as possible in patients suffering from renal cancers. Da Vinci’s contribution to performing minimally invasive partial nephrectomy is becoming widely known and for good reason. Earlier this month, the International Urologic Robotic Society convened their annual meeting in Las Vegas. Over 500 surgeons representing 21 countries were in attendance. Prostate, renal, and bladder cancer along with benign reconstructive procedures were the primary topics of this year’s meeting. As you might expect, the volume of DVP material presented was abundance to say the least, but what really caught our attention was both the number and quality of the da Vinci renal surgery procedure presentations and most notably da Vinci partial nephrectomy. Dr. Eric Weise, Director of Robotic Surgery at Lutheran Hospital in Fort Wayne, Indiana, presented his comprehensive da Vinci partial nephrectomy data. Dr. Weise, a leader in this field, began incorporating da Vinci in his renal surgery practice in 2005, and he has tracked outcomes in a diligent manner. What Dr. Weise showed was that the indications for da Vinci partial nephrectomy expanded significantly through his learning curve. In his analysis, he compared both the percentage of da Vinci partial nephrectomies performed as a subset of all renal tumor patients as well as the measured size of the tumor. He stratified five groups into independent 6-month intervals and compared them to one another. His results were impressive. In his first 60 patients, he was able to perform 10 da Vinci partial nephrectomies or 17%, and median tumor size was 1.9 cm, and the maximum size of 3.3 cm. In his second group, he performed 9 da Vinci partial nephrectomies out of 23 candidates or 39%, with a median tumor size of 3 cm and a maximum size of 5 cm. In his third group, he performed 24 da Vinci partial nephrectomies out of 49 candidates or 49% with median tumors of 2.9 cm and a maximum of 5.4 cm. In the fourth group, 30 out of 44 candidates or 68% median tumor growing to 3.2% and the largest being 7 cm, and fifth and final sixth month group, he performed a da Vinci partial nephrectomy, and 22 out of a possible 25 candidates, 88% with a median tumor size of 3.8 cm and the largest being 10.6 cm in size.  In just over three years, he has expanded da Vinci partial nephrectomy in his patients suffering from renal tumors from 17% to 88% while the average tumor size within that period doubled. The theme of expanding indications through one’s experience is consistent with what we saw in da Vinci prostatectomy, da Vinci hysterectomy, and da Vinci mitral valve repair, and as a theme we would expect to continue with in all our targeted procedures.  In closing, I’ll call your attention to some interesting statistics associated with the recent World Congress of Endourology Meeting that took place in Shanghai. This year’s meeting speaks volumes to how far we have come within the specialty of urology. The World Congress of Endourology Meeting is a form where anything and everything associated with urologic disorders is discussed and presented. The list of topics is enormous and includes everything from pharmacology to radical surgery. The global number of da Vinci-related abstracts and presentations at this year’s conference was rich. For the entire conference, 2120 papers and abstracts were submitted, and 1847 were accepted. Out of these, 158 or 9% were related to da Vinci surgery. While da Vinci prostatectomy topics contributed have of these accepted abstracts, da Vinci nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy, cystectomy, pyeloplasty, urogynecologic procedures, and da Vinci pediatric procedures contributed the rest. The accepted abstracts were offered in a variety of countries which included United States, France, the UK, Korea, Turkey, Australia, China, Italy, Venezuela, and India. It was not that long ago when we would have been pleased to have any da Vinci-related abstracts accepted at this prestigious meeting, so to have 9% of all excepted abstracts relate to da Vinci surgery, and having them originate from nearly a dozen countries is truly exceptional.  That concludes my summary, and then I’ll turn the time over to Ben.
Benjamin Gong:  I’ll be providing our 2009 financial forecast from revenue to earnings per share on a GAAP reporting basis. I will also provide estimates of certain non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures, as Aleks mentioned, we are continuing to see strong growth driven by DVP and DVH as well as other urology procedures such as nephrectomies and partial nephrectomies and other gynecology procedures such as sacral colpopexies. In 2009, we expect total procedures to grow 35 to 40% from approximately 136,000 procedures performed in 2008. Our instrument and accessory revenues are driven by procedures performed. However, we expect these revenues to grow at a slower rate than procedures in 2009. While procedures are expected to grow 35 to 40% this year, we are forecasting our instrument and accessory revenues to grow to 25 to 30%. There are three main factors that causing a downward trend in our revenue per procedure. First, initial stocking orders continue to comprise of lower proportion of total instrument accessory revenues as our installed base continues to grow. Secondly, as customers increase their utilization rates, they become more efficient in their use of consumable supplies, and finally, we are seeing a higher growth in benign GYN procedures that require fewer instruments. As our procedure counts grow in to the hundreds of thousands per year, we naturally expect efficiencies to gradually bring down the revenues we generate on each procedure. System revenues are more difficult for us to project. In the current hospital spending environment, our ability to sell systems in the short term is less certain, and we would caution you not to place undue reliance on our forecast for system revenues. Nevertheless, based on our projected procedure growth, we believe that customers will purchase a similar number of systems in 2009 as we saw in 2008. Therefore, we expect system revenues in 2009 to be relatively flat compared with 2008. Based on flat system sales for 2009 and consistent pricing on service contracts, we expect service revenues in 2009 to grow approximately 35% from 2008.  In summary, estimate our topline revenue growth in 2009 to be approximately 15%. With regard to gross profit margin, we averaged approximately 71% for all of 2008. For 2009, we expect our gross margins to slightly lower to between 70 and 71% based on the expected higher mix of service revenue and the US dollar’s recent strength against foreign currencies. With regard to operating expense, we expect total operating expense to grow approximately 20% in 2009. Included in this estimate are some significant increases in non-cash expenses.  First with regard to FAS123R, in 2008, we recorded $77 million in stock compensation expense. In 2009, assuming our stock price remains at approximately $100 per share, we expect stock compensation expense to increase 22% to approximately $93 million, and secondly with regard to IP amortization charges, we scheduled to record to $14 million in the R&D expense line for 2009, up 40% from the $10 million we recorded in 2008. We plan to manage our fixed cost closely as we demonstrated in Q4, but we will continue to add resources in the sales and R&D functions as we view these as important investments to continue driving growth in the near term and the long term. We expect operating income to grow 7 to 8% for the year.  With regard to income tax, we reported a GAAP tax rate of approximately 39% for all of 2008 while our effective cash tax rate was approximately 22%. For 2009, we expect to report a GAAP tax rate of approximately 40%. Our effective cash tax rate is largely dependent on employee stock option exercises during the year. Given the recent drop in our stock price, we expect a significantly smaller benefit than we have seen in recent years, and therefore, our effective cash tax rate could reach as high as 40%. We expect earnings per share to come in between $5.30 and $5.40, representing approximately 5% growth from 2008 to 2009.  That concludes our prepared remarks. We’ll now open the call to your questions.
Operator:  (Operator instructions) The first question comes from the line of Tao Levy from Deutsche Bank
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: The strength in the quarter internationally, it seems like you get blocks of systems from countries, like 5 in Germany. Are these government tenders or how does that process work or is it is just coincidence? Also if you can just comment on what you see developing internationally just given the economic issues that they are also facing right now.
Benjamin Gong: You are right. We had for example 5 different sales in Germany. That was not part of one system sale for a government. They were actually five different individuals, but to your point selling three systems in Korea, and we do have probably a headwind with the exchange rate in Korea being much weaker against the dollar, and what you saw in Q4 was certainly a strong quarter, but as we saw in Q1 of last year, international system sales sequentially in Q1 are likely to be lower than what we saw in Q4.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: In general, the international environment, what you’re getting from sales force, has that changed just as much as you’ve seen here in the US?
Marshall L. Mohr: When we look at the things that we can see, and the most important thing we can see are procedures, and Q4 procedures, both US and OUS were really strong, exceptionally strong OUS, so when we take the temperature of the individual salespeople and people focused on procedures, it seems really strong in DVP. We are starting see a little bit of nice uptake in DVH, which we have talked about in the past as has lagging. The cancer procedures around nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy, and as Lonnie mentioned in his summary, even some procedures that we don’t see being performed in the United States in great numbers are being performed in places like Asia, mainly thyroidectomy, gastrectomy, and some of the colon procedures, so I would say in general as we have said in the past, international is made up of multiple markets, but if I were to assess it globally, I would say that it was very strong in Q4. Individual systems, as we talked about in years past or quarters past, for example, when we see a spike in Belgium or in Korea, that’s going to vary from quarter to quarter, country to country.
Benjamin Gong: In terms of visibility, the sales force in Europe seems relatively positive, but visibility from where we sit with all the news that keeps coming is uncertain, and I wish I could give you an answer, but it’s kind of one of those things time will tell. We will continue to drive hard. Procedures will be key to driving new systems sales, and just like the rest of the world, we are going to have to take this a step at a time as this evolves and hopefully we will start to come out of this economic disaster.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: You’ve announced over the last few months some R&D alliances. You haven’t spent too much time going through what those alliances bring to the table in terms of advancing robotic surgery. If you can maybe spend just a couple of points on why it’s important, why you did them, why you are spending their, and again the benefits of that.
Gary S. Guthart: As we look at the technology acquisitions we’ve done, there have been few that I will call out. You have seen recently SurgiQuest and Novadaq. We have PMI also, and I guess what I will tell you about the grouping as a whole is that in each of these we are looking for component technologies that when added to robotics give us better clinical outcomes, and we think those examples do that in the case of stapling, it will give us access to a different set of procedures. In the case of Novadaq, that’s fluorescence imaging, we think that will drive clinical benefits in a variety of procedures, so that’s what we are looking to do, and when we see those opportunities, we pursue them, and we have done that aggressively this last year, and we will continue as opportunities present themselves.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Is there any timing you can provide as to when we could see some of these, maybe 5 years down the road, 12 months, 2 years?
Gary S. Guthart: We are working aggressively, but we are not ready to tell you any specific timeline.
Benjamin Gong: Tao, it’s something I said over and over again, and I will continue to say it. We truly believe that robotic surgery is going to displace a very significant part of traditional open surgery, and this is a long-term play, and so we are trying in these kinds of investments to look out and anticipate where it’s going and make sure that we have a pre-emptive position as we drive adoption of surgical robotics on a very broad scale both in this country and worldwide.
Operator:  The next question comes from Mimi Pham with JMP Securities.
Mimi Pham – JMP Securities:  Can you provide some more color on the fourth quarter system shortfall in the US? Were these likely postponements or flat-out cancellations?
Benjamin Gong: We went into even December with quite a few customers in the United States who were indicating that they wanted to purchase systems, and in the end they ultimately didn’t. We think these are all credible customers, and they all would like to either get their first da Vinci system or an additional da Vinci system, so they are most likely postponements. Is that a postponement to next quarter or next year? I think that remains to be seen.
Mimi Pham – JMP Securities:  Do you get a census if the reasons why for the postponements also, like have you talked to them in depth? Are they just waiting maybe for the new budget, financing? Has that been an issue for any of the placements, being able to get financing?
Benjamin Gong: It was pretty broad. There was not any particular, I’d say, one segment that we can point out, existing customer or new customer or big hospital or small hospital. I guess the overriding theme that they didn’t want to spend money or did not have money to spend at this particular time.
Lonnie M. Smith: Mimi, I think there were several systems where given the economy, hospitals were pressing for very significant discounts, and many of those we just walked away from because that gets to be a slippery slope, and people see an opportunity, and I’m sure some of the suppliers they are talking to get a little desperate, and we not going to do that.
Benjamin Gong: Also related to your question, Mimi, is we often get asked how many systems are financed. In Q4, it was between 15 and 20%, so it was not materially different than we saw in Q2 or Q3. There were certainly a lot of people who were interested in that, and those folks who were interested and wanted to follow through were able to obtain financing. I would also point out that there were five different leasing companies out there who provided financing for da Vinci purchases during the quarter, so there generally is financing available.  
Mimi Pham – JMP Securities: I know your guidance for systems is based on your procedure growth, but can you at least comment on your systems pipeline heading into 2009 relative to the absolute number heading into 2008 to give us some more color? Is it substantially higher or a little bit higher or around the same level?
Benjamin Gong: Well, we go through our bottoms-up forecast in a similar manner every year, and we do take a look at that pipeline, and when we came up with our forecast for flat systems for next year, it was in light of what we saw in that pipeline, but even though there is a pretty healthy pipeline, it’s not certain as to when any of these particular systems are going to actually close, and nowadays it is less certain than it ever has been.
Mimi Pham – JMP Securities: Can you at least provide some color? Is it in absolute terms of bigger than what you had entering 2008?
Lonnie M. Smith: We didn’t make that comparison, so we are not prepared to say.
Mimi Pham – JMP Securities: Your sales strategy in terms of systems and driving utilization, are you changing anything given the more challenging environment, does that change in any way in terms of the sale force and how they go into the accounts?
Marshall L. Mohr: I think the recipe we have for growing procedures is pretty well baked, and I think it has been pretty successful, so we’re certainly not going to get away from our strength. Now the question of allocating resources, certainly that is something that we look at and decide how we are going to spend and where we are going to spend it, but the process of awareness and driving through education and proctoring and training, etc., is a good established process, and there is no reason to get away from that.
Operator:  The next question comes from Vincent Ricci from Wachovia. 
Vincent Ricci – Wachovia:  From listening to yourself and some other companies, it sounds like in the middle to late half of December things got very ugly. I was just wondering if you guys could maybe shed some light unto us as to what changed in those two months that may have not been around in November when the hospitals were setting their budgets.
Marshall L. Mohr: Unfortunately the third month of every quarter is always the heaviest month for selling systems, and so March, June, September, and December all are pretty big months for us, so going into December it didn’t seem any particularly different than a March or September, but as that month progressed, and certainly toward the end there, there were a number of people who decided they weren’t going to by.
Benjamin Gong: I would say also Vincent if you were look at the activity that the sales force goes through in closing a system, our sales force was as busy in the fourth quarter as they were at any other time. What was different is that the signatures didn’t come when you wanted the signatures to come, but the demand and people that we’re looking at getting involved in robotic surgery or getting second and third systems, and the activities supporting that was very high, so it isn’t that it just got ugly and changed materially.
Lonnie M. Smith: As said, we were very active. At the operational level, people were ready to buy. They clearly see the benefits and are supportive of it, and that’s the reason we saw all that kind of activity. We don’t sit in the broad meetings of all these hospitals, so we are really not privy to it, but the people we have talked to or I have talked to would tell you that that when capital decisions in general came up to the board level, with the media and everything that’s happening in the economy, some of these boards just decided to postpone the capital expenditure or cut their capital budgets significantly, so I don’t think it is anything different than what has happened across the economy. When it reached that level, I think people have gotten very conservative and fearful and therefore have postponed purchases that they might have planned when they made their capital budgets. The world has changed since people made their capital budgets over a year ago.
Vincent Ricci – Wachovia:  Could you explain a little bit better the hedging plan that you guys are putting in place?
Benjamin Gong: Again, we are entering in an environment where as you’ve probably watched, the euro-dollar relationship changes dramatically day to day, and in order not to be the victim of those fluctuations on a P&L basis, we took out some hedges on our balance sheet position at the end of year, and as you know we sold 30 systems and a number of those in euro, so we hedged our balances at the end of the year, and we’ll evaluate each month and may take out additional hedges as the original hedges lapse, and based on what we’ve got in the way of euro. We also wanted to again for planning purposes lock in better what we would wind up realizing in the way of revenue, and so we did take out couple of hedges to deal with revenue during the first 6 months of this year.
Vincent Ricci – Wachovia:  A couple of other medical device companies have commented over the last couple of days that for them being that they are in a strong financial position which you guys have been due to your prudent use of cash, this has presented a once in a lifetime opportunity for them to go out there and make strategic acquisitions. For you guys, you’ve largely done a lot of partnerships and licensing agreements. I’m just wondering are there any assets out there in the private markets, public markets that you think that can help bolster your platform and get you into newer markets that you might not have been able to get into without that technology. Anything you see interesting?
Lonnie M. Smith: I think the answer is since we are on the forefront of robotic surgery, there is nothing out there that we would buy a company that would provide significant near-term or long-term capability. The things that we are looking at are the things that Gary mentioned earlier, technologies that we can develop so that it would either be an adjunct or support entry into new surgical procedures or surgical segments or just enhancements of the surgical capability of the system, but we are not going to go out and buy a suture company or some manual surgical device company because that takes us exactly the opposite direction that we are trying to take the markets.
Operator:  The next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley:  I appreciate the 15% and your prudent comments about boxes and box guidance. You are guiding a 15% topline and 5% bottomline. Am I hearing you say that you are committed to that 5% EPS number regardless of how the macro environment changes or should we assume, or if the topline changes, the bottomline could change as well?
Benjamin Gong: Certainly.
Marshall L. Mohr: We are committed to continuing to invest in our future, and so that’s why that disparity could occur.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley:  Okay, Marshall, so you are going to continue to spend through this. You are not making commitments though. We will not be flat year over year.
Marshall L. Mohr: The fact is that we truly believe that we have started this new technology. We are well into the process, and there’s enormous growth ahead. Now, we’re going through a business cycle that may cause a pause, but we’re going to continue to invest in the technologies and product enhancements and everything else that when we come out of this we will be in a position to continue to grow and to drive the adoption of robotics in surgery.
Lonnie M. Smith: Having said that, we do endeavor to control expenses to the best of our ability where they are controllable and they don’t affect our future.
Benjamin Gong:  As an example, Marshall pointed out a couple of things. We’ve postponed building a building. We’ve put that on hold for a while. We cut back on some outside services even during the fourth quarter. You saw that operating expenses actually in the fourth quarter were down sequentially from Q3, so we’re trying to be prudent about those that we are spending money on.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: So maybe earnings won’t change as fast as revenue, but if revenue changes, earnings can change.
Benjamin Gong: Correct.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: On revenue per procedure, I think I understood the nature of optimization of procedure as well as mix. What did you forecast though, Ben, for 2009 in terms of how prevalent or pervasive this mix shift issue happens? In other words, what did you assume for revenue per procedure for 2009?
Benjamin Gong: We are forecasting a continued reduction, and we took that into account in that roughly speaking a 10% differential in the growth rate. You have a 35-40% growth rate in procedures versus a 25-30% growth rate in the revenues, and so what that turns into is a gradual decrease of that revenue per procedure over time driven by those three factors, and I think what you’re alluding to is do we expect more benign dVH growth as a percentage of the total, and the answer is yes.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: You feel that assumes some trajectory on benign hysterectomy and assumes some optimization in prostatectomy, and you’re fairly confident that number is unlikely to worsen more than 10%?
Benjamin Gong: We gave a forecast of that 35-40% procedure growth. We feel pretty confident in that procedure growth rate, and in order to get there, those big procedures like dVH and dVP have to grow. 
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Lastly, Lonnie, you made comments about not wanting to discount on price, which obviously we think is the right strategy. You also have been sort of averse to taking risk to your balance sheet. You have a very large balance sheet. Would you consider taking capital risk and balance sheet risk to promote the revenue line this year?
Lonnie M. Smith: I’m not sure what you mean.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Extending financing, doing sales-type lease terms with your customers.
Lonnie M. Smith:  Well, we’ve looked at that, and right now we have lenders who are quite ready to provide that service. We’ve had no problem with it. If it came to that, then we certainly would consider it. I think it certainly is an option. We have, as you say, a large asset on the balance sheet. It’s not giving us a very attractive return. On the other hand, it gives us enormous flexibility, and in this market, as it was mentioned earlier, there are opportunities that we want to be in a position to take if and when they come, but it is an asset that doesn’t give us very good return, and if there are better ways to utilize that asset, we will do so.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: With 22% to 25% of your market cap in cash, is there any point at which share buybacks become a useful return on capital?
Lonnie M. Smith: We do manage the business for long term, and with that said, I didn’t think we’d be asking this question either. It’s a board decision and not a management decision. It’s something we would have to bring to the board, but at the current prices, I would certainly consider that as a possible use of a portion of the cash.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frederick A. Wise from Leerink Swann
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: I’m just trying to assess the near to medium term risk and outlook here. Is it possible or does it seem realistic as we think about gauging the quarters, metering the quarters throughout the year that first half of 2009 is a lot tougher than the second half or the fourth quarter of ’08 or a lot weaker than the second half of ’09, and so this sort of basically flat outlook, we’re going to have to wait until we get to the fourth quarter of ’09 to really see that all play out, if you see where I’m going Ben. 
Benjamin Gong: A lot depends on the general market conditions, and I think that’s the broader economy that Lonnie is referring to. If we are in this situation in terms of capital spending for a long period of time, then we’re just going to be in this period of uncertainly for that long. I don’t know that you could say that we’re going to have more clarity in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year, other than it’s closer to the end, so are you going to be able to predict the finish a little bit better? I guess so. 
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: I know you’re not planning to give quarterly guidance, but it seems to me that in the first quarter, I just don’t know what would change from this sort of tone and mindset of the hospitals that you saw in December.
Benjamin Gong:  I see. What I should say is our guidance assumes the same or similar seasonality as we’ve seen in the past, meaning sequentially down in Q1 from Q4. So what’s the metric? I think in Q1 of 2008, we had revenues of about $188 million. We had 74 systems that were sold, so the comparisons that we’re going to be making are against that first quarter, and not against the fourth quarter.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Can you give us any color or could this be an exceptionally weak or the weakest quarter of the year in a profound way than the normal usual seasonal pattern?
Benjamin Gong:  We don’t have a lot of clarity in the pipeline, Rick. It’s really hard to predict at this point in time, and I think what Ben told you is the probably the best we can do at this point, which is to just point out that we will see seasonality. 
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann:  If it turns out as we proceed through the year that 2009 is materially worse than the flat outlook, how would you manage the business differently appreciating that you have this desire to and an appropriate one to invest in the long term development of robitics? How quickly and where could you adjust?  
Lonnie M. Smith:  We look at cost very carefully, and we’re very prudent about where we spend money. However, as we said earlier to an earlier question, we will continue to invest in our future.
Lonnie M. Smith: In this environment we will focus our resources on those things where we think we can get the greatest leverage, and in the sales organization, probably we will invest more heavily on the clinical side driving procedures. This is going to be something you manage literally on a very tight timer depending upon how things start to evolve. You pick up the Financial Times every morning and just look at what’s on and the announcements today are Microsoft, Intel….This is something we will manage on a short leash. Now, in terms of procedures, we won’t cut out things that we think are fundamental to driving adoption, but we will focus our resources on those things, and some other things we may have to postpone. Depending upon how it rolls out, we will continue to adjust and move. One other thing about being in unexplored territory is that we’ve had to be from the beginning pretty agile. There’s lots of new information coming. There’s not a tried and proven path that everybody goes down. This is new territory, and so I think we’re well equipped to be responsive to the uncertainties of the financial markets that we haven’t had because we’ve been dealing with the same kinds of things with adoption and the technology. If anybody could predict what the end of 2009 is going to look like or 2010, and we can run a lot of different scenarios, one thing we know is we’ve got a strong cash position, cash and investments, so we’re financially in a good position to endure that, and in this market, there are a lot of companies that are not. We tend to be fairly conservative and prudent about those things that we believe are fundamental to our long-term strategy of driving this adoption, but you’re going to have to ride alongside of us. We’re in this together, and we will respond to the market as it comes, and if all of a sudden we start to see it’s coming out of it, we will move resources to do it. If it tends to move down, we will adjust resources within to adjust to that as well.  
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann:  Mexico you talked about, Marshall, that the initial cost savings were offset by the startup cost. Can you give us any flavor for what kind of incremental annual savings in any shape or form you want to describe it that that could benefit ’09 and be an offsetting counterbalance to some of the things that are going on?
Marshall L. Mohr: Where you save money in Mexico is on labor. The material costs which frankly is the majority of the cost of our instruments is the same whether you’re operating in Mexico or here because the suppliers are the same, so you basically look at the labor content which is not a significant portion of the overall cost, and then you have to think about instruments, and instruments is only a portion of our overall revenues. So from an impact on gross margin standpoint, it is not going to be very impactful, it’s certainly worth a while.  
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann:  The weakness that you saw in December, is it possible to make any generalizations about it, large hospital versus small hospital, urology more deferred or gynecology?
Benjamin Gong: It really wasn’t any particular segment, if you will, that was seemingly impacted.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. 
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: I have a question on pricing and what you’re assuming in terms of ASP. You talked a little bit about the pricing drop you saw this quarter, and I guess you commented it was a combination of geographic mix and then people migrating maybe toward lower-priced systems. Can you give us a sense as to what you are assuming for ASPs for ’09?
Benjamin Gong: Similar to ’08, and there was a range for all of ’08, and quite coincidentally it came out to be on average about the same as ’07. As exchange rates and different mixes changed during the year, you saw it go up and down, but in the end, it turned out to be about the same.
Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan: On the margin issue, can you remind us what the relative margins are between the three? You gave overall margin guidance for the year, but just give us a little bit granularity on the three pieces?
Benjamin Gong: The gross margins on systems are similar to that of instruments and accessories. The gross margins on service are a little bit lower, and service is going to be growing, let’s say, faster than for example systems. Therefore, that could cause the overall gross margin to be a little bit lower, but not much, for next year.
Operator: Our final question comes from Amit Hazan from Oppenheimer. 
Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer: On the procedure side, I just want to get a confirmation that hysterectomy actually grew 150% and that prostatectomy actually grew above 30%. Is that correct?
Benjamin Gong:  It is, and roughly speaking we ended up with about 73,000 prostatectomies and something around 34,000 hysterectomies in the year. 
Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer:  In terms of hysterectomy, are you modeling or expecting or thinking about or have you seen yet any sensitivity to the economy in that procedure in particular?
Benjamin Gong: Interestingly all the procedures grew pretty strongly throughout the fourth quarter. We ended up with 60% year over year growth, 61% Q4 to Q4, and benign versus malignant hysterectomies, again, both of them grew at a very good rate with benign growing faster. Both of them have remainder on our curves, so we have not seen at this point in time, but we do so see some quarter to quarter deviation on and off the curve, but the curves have a very high correlation, so it’s not been significant enough other than noise. 
Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer: Is it fair to say in terms of the guidance that you’re modeling along that curve and not expecting any economic issues to hysterectomy?
Benjamin Gong: We are watching it and taking it a month, a day, or a quarter at a time, but so far we have not seen a significant shift.
Lonnie M. Smith: I think what surprised a lot of people throughout the year is that the actual rate and the size growth of benign over malignant was greater.
Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer: On followup on gross margin, and I’m trying to get to your guidance. I’m thinking the mix probably shifts to OUS in 2009 a little bit like we saw in the fourth quarter, and as you said, you have the service component. 70 to 71, like you said, is not far off from what you did in ’08. With that mix shift to OUS, am I missing something? Is there something else that you’re counting on, or do the OUS gross margins actually come pretty close to the US? How do you get there, or is that shift not going to happen? Am I wrong on that?
Benjamin Gong: When we sell through distributors, it’s a lower gross margin. When we sell direct, it’s a little bit higher, so there’s mix shift even within the international. We’re taking, I think, a reasonable estimate as to what that mix is going to be, but we even saw for a example a product mix in Q4 that was a little bit less strong than what you saw in Q3, so there’s definitely going to be some fluctuations in there, and we’d probably be fooling you if we said we could call it any closer than what we just said. 
Lonnie M. Smith:  As I have said previously, we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits, and cash flow during these conference calls, but our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. Two brief examples of what this means in the lives of our patients, the first is a patient of Thomas Randalls, a GYN oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. This woman was brought to the office by her daughter for treatment for recurrent uterine cancer. One year earlier, she had undergone radiation therapy to the pelvis following an open hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy for treatment of uterine cancer involving the vagina. Prior to her visit, she had seen two other GYN oncologists, and the first had recommended further chemotherapy, although this had only about a 20% chance of working, and the second recommended a total pelvic sweep or surgical removal of the entire vagina, bladder, and rectum because after radiotherapy it become virtually impossible to dissect the vagina free from the surrounding structures using traditional surgical techniques. With the da Vinci system, Dr. Randall was able to perform a complete removal of the vagina including the recurrent tumor without injury to the bladder, uterus, or rectum. Surgical margins were negative for cancer, and 4 months later, she is without evidence of recurrence nor of surgical complication. So this is a pretty significant improvement from what her life would have been like if she had not had a surgery with a da Vinci system. The second patient is a sister of one of our clinical sales managers, and I’d like to read a message that she sent to me. She says Stephanie is 36 years old, married with three children, and the youngest is 2 years old. Her husband is a fireman, and she works part time as a hospice nurse. She has struggled with pelvic pain and abnormal bleeding most of her adult life. After having children, Stephanie’s OB/GYN recommended a hysterectomy, but after performing an exam and completing an ultrasound, was not sure he could perform the procedure minimal invasively. Because of prior open abdominal surgery to remove one of her ovaries when was 16 years old, Stephanie feared having a hysterectomy because she vividly remembered the pain, discomfort, and downtime from her previous experience. Daily care requirements of her three children and the financial implications of an extended recovery period were also serious considerations. As part-time employee, she didn’t qualify for compensation during her medical leave. She scheduled the surgery with the OB/GYN because she trusted his opinion. She goes on to say after hearing my sister’s situation, I immediately called Dr. Cohen at Ohio State. He shared with her the advantages of robotic surgery and why he would be able to overcome the limitations that may cause other surgeons to perform a total abdominal hysterectomy. He performed the robotic procedure two weeks later. The result: Stephanie was out of the hospital within 23 hours, Christmas shopping four days later, and did 20 minutes on an elliptical trainer one week post-op, and then she goes on to say, P.S., my mother had a TAH 20 years ago and was in the hospital for 7 days. We are making a difference. Patients like these are our strongest advocates for surgery with the da Vinci system and are the very foundation of our operating performance. In closing, I assure you we will remain committed to focusing on the vital few things that truly make a difference as we strive to take surgery beyond the limits of human hand.  That concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support in this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.
Operator: The call has ended. Please disconnect.

Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at www.intuitivesurgical.com on the audio archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. First, Lonnie will present the quarter's business highlights. Marshall will follow with a review of our third quarter's financial results. Next, Aleks will discuss sales and marketing highlights, then I'll provide an update to our financial forecast for 2008 and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'd like to introduce Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you for joining us today. This past quarter, we continued to drive and broaden the adoption of robotically-assisted surgery, resulting in significant top and bottom-line growth. Operating highlights for the third quarter are as follows. We sold 91 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 63 system sold during the third quarter of last year. 20 of the systems were sold through existing customers. Our international team contributed 20 of the 91 systems sold, up from 17 last year. We passed through two significant milestones during the third quarter. We exceeded 1000 da Vinci systems installed worldwide. And we installed systems in Mesilla, Montana, Casper, Wyoming and Albuquerque, New Mexico and now have at least one system in each of the United States. Procedure adoption continues to be procedure specific, patient driven and the primary growth driver of our business. In what has historically been a seasonally slow quarter, we had solid quarter-over-quarter procedure growth led by GYN with strong growth in the United States and a pronounced seasonal drop in Europe. Among our fastest growing procedures in terms of percent of sequential quarter-to-quarter growth were nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy for kidney cancer, radical cystectomy for bladder cancer, hysterectomy, sacral colpopexy and colon resection. Total revenue grew to $236 million, up 50% from last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $76 million, up 53%. Total recurring revenue, including service, grew to $110 million, up 54% from the prior year comprising 46% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $106 million, 45% of revenue, before non-cash 123R stock option expense, up 69% from the third quarter of last year. GAAP net income grew to $58 million, 24% of revenue, up 41% from last year. We ended the quarter with $821 million in cash and investments, up $82 million from last quarter and up $288 million in the last 12 months. After subtracting $19 million in cash receipts from exercise of stock options and added back $28 million invested in fixed assets, purchase of intellectual property and working capital during the quarter. Our gross operating cash flow in the third quarter amounted to 158% of our reported GAAP net income. We ramped up production in our new instrument plant in Mexicali Mexico, and we are pleased with operating performance of this new production facility. And finally, we grew our Intuitive team by 78 members to 1,013. With that, I'll pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Lonnie. Total third quarter revenue of $236 million, increased 50% compared with $156.9 million for the third quarter 2007, and increased 8% compared with $219.2 million for the second quarter of 2008. Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows: instrument and accessory revenue increased $76 million, up 53% compared to $49.5 million last year and up 3% compared with $73.6 million last quarter. The growth rate in instruments and accessories is a direct result of our procedure growth rates. Procedure growth rates increased slightly more than instrument and accessory revenue, reflecting procedure mix and hospital efficiency. Overall as expected, procedure and instrument accessory growth rates reflect seasonality particularly in our European business. The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we earned per procedure declined slightly but remains in a range of between $1500 and $2000 per procedure for established da Vinci accounts and up between $2000 and $2300 per procedure including initial stocking orders. Systems revenue of $126.3 million increased 48% compared with the $85.6 million last year and increased 9% compared with $116.2 million last quarter. The increase in systems revenue compared with the second quarter of 2008 reflects increased unit sales, as well as an increase in the average revenue per system. Third quarter da Vinci Surgical Systems revenue reflects the sale of 91 systems compared with 63 systems sold in during the third quarter of last year, and 85 systems sold in the second quarter of this year. 76 of the systems sold during the quarter were our latest S model incorporating high definition vision capabilities. 11 were four-arm S models incorporating standard vision capabilities. Two were three-arm S models, and two were refurbished standard systems. 20 of the systems... system sales were outside of the U.S. compared with 19 in the second quarter of 2008 and 17 in the third quarter of 2007. Five of the system sales in the quarter involved trade-ins. Our third quarter average revenue per system, including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades, was $1.37 million which is 20,000 more than the average revenue per system in the second quarter of 2008. The higher average revenue per system primarily reflects favorable product mix. Service and training revenue increased to $33.7 million, up 54% compared with $21.9 million last year and up 15% compared with $29.4 million last quarter. The growth in service and training revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base and non-contract revenue. Total third quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $109.7 million, up 54% compared with the third quarter of 2007 and up 6% compared with the second quarter of 2008. Recurring revenue reflects or represented 46% of total revenue in the third quarter compared with 47% in the second quarter of 2008. Revenue outside the United States represented 19% of total third quarter revenue compared with 20% last quarter, reflecting the strength in our U.S. business coupled with a seasonal slowdown overseas. Our third quarter 2008 gross margin of 71.9% was higher than the 71.2% realized in the second quarter, primarily reflecting lower cost of service. Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2008 were $84.5 million compared with $77.9 million in the second quarter of 2008. This sequential operating expense increase of $6.9 million reflects increased surgeon training activities, increased R&D activities, increased non-cash flow 123R stock compensation expense, commissions on increased revenue and costs associated with increased headcount. We added 78 employees during the third quarter ending the period with 1,013 regular employees. The majority of the additions were to our worldwide sales and support and manufacturing organizations. Third quarter 2008 operating income was $85 million or 36% of sales, compared with $78.2 million or 35.7% of sales for the second quarter of 2008. Third quarter operating income included $21 million of 123R stock compensation expenses compared with $19.7 million in the second quarter. The increase of $1.3 million reflects options granted to new hire. Our third quarter 2008 other income was $4.6 million, which is lower than the $5.7 million realized in the second quarter, reflecting exchange losses on euro accounts, as the euro weakened against the dollar during the quarter and lower interest rates on our investment portfolio. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 35.7% which is lower than the rate of 39% recorded for the first six months of the year. The decrease in our rate reflects $3.1 million of 2007 R&D credits recorded in association with our 2007 tax return which was filed in September. I should note that in October, Congress renewed the federal R&D credit for 2008. We will quantify and record the benefit of this new law change in the fourth quarter. We continue to utilize carry-forward tax benefits in stock... and employee stock related tax benefits in 2008 and expect that our cash outlays with income taxes will be approximately 20% of pre-tax income for 2008. Our net income at $57.6 million or $1.44 per share increased 41% compared with $40.9 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2007 and increased 13% compared with $51.2 million or $1.28 per share for the second quarter of 2008. Let me quickly summarize our results for the first nine months of 2008. Total revenue for the first nine months of 2008 was $643.4 million, up 56% compared with $411.4 million last year. Operating income for the first nine months of 2008 was $228.1 million, up 71% compared with $133.4 million last year. Operating income included $55.2 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first nine months of 2008, compared with $26.2 million in 2007. Net income for the first nine months of 2008 was $153.6 million or $3.84 per share, up 61% compared with $95.4 million or $2.46 per share last year. Now turning our attention to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter of 2008 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $821 million, up $82 million from June 30, 2008. $18.7 million of the cash generated in quarter was associated with stock purchase activities. The remaining cash generated is primarily related to operating activities. Capital expenditures for the third quarter included $13.5 million payment associated with the purchase of intellectual property from Power Medical Interventions Inc. and $7.5 million of expenditures associated with facilities and information technology infrastructure to support our growth. The total costs of the Power Medical Interventions purchased of $20 million will be amortized over a five-year period. At September 30, we held $87 million of student loan backed auction rate securities. Earlier this week, UBS offered to purchase the auction rate securities held by them at their par value of approximately $71 million, any time during a two-year period beginning at June 30, 2010. If we accept their offer, we will likely have to take a charge to other income in the fourth quarter for the difference in value of the auction and the unrealized loss on these securities, which was approximately $6 million at September 30, 2008. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $173.7 million at September 30, compared $162.1 million at June 30, 2008. The change in receivables reflects higher revenue in the third quarter. Our net inventory increased to $52.5 million at September 30, compared with $42.6 million at June 30. Our inventory turns at September 30 decreased to 4.8 times compared with 5.7 turns at the end of the previous quarter. The increase in inventory reflects a planned increase for future growth. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Strategy: Thank you, Marshall. During the third quarter, we sold 91 da Vinci systems, 71 in the United States, 12 in Europe and eight into rest of world markets. A total of five system sales were part of trade-off transactions. The net 86 new installations brings to 1032, the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 776 in the United States, 171 in Europe and 85 in rest of world markets. 15 of the 86 net systems installed during the quarter represented repeats system sales to existing customers, which brings to 122, the total number of customers which own two or more da Vinci systems. Also, as of Q3, we have placed at least one da Vinci into all 50 states. International sales included two more than da Vinci placements into the countries of Korea, China, The Czech Republic and Greece. Clinically, we had another good quarter. In what is a seasonally slow quarter, we delivered solid procedure growth within several of our targeted surgical specialties. Procedure growth was led by da Vinci Hysterectomy both for benign and malignant conditions but most notably within dVH for benign conditions. Sacral colpopexy and myomectomy also showed excellent growth. Within our urology business, notably our kidney and bladder business, da Vinci Nephrectomy, and partial nephrectomy and da Vinci Cystectomy, showed excellent growth. Our U.S. dVP growth was steady, while our international dVP business was seasonally slower and lagged behind. Our cardiothoracic business remains steady. In Q3, there were over 180 da Vinci related clinical papers published within various peer-reviewed journals throughout several surgical specialties. And within limited Q3 medical conferences that took place during the quarter, several scientific abstracts, clinical posters and podium presentations highlighted da Vinci's clinical benefit. There were a number of favorable highlights from these various sources but I'll limit my review to a few. In the September edition of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Ash Towori, Professor of Urology of Kernel University Medical Center provided a rebuttal to a comparative analysis of various surgical approaches to radical prostatectomy that was published in an earlier edition. Dr. Towori took issue with previous studies design and lack of clarity between traditional laparoscopic prostatectomy and dVP results, which for this particular study, were blended into a single minimally invasive radical prostatectomy category. To address this misleading results, Dr. Towori published his data on 1,170 dVP patients collected between 2005 and 2008. The results provided absolute transparency between the previously reported results for open prostatectomy minimally invasive radical prostatectomy and dVP. The comparison was striking. Comparing perioperative complications between the three cohorts showed open prostatectomy with a rate of 36.4% minimally invasive radical prostatectomy, 29.8% and dVP 1.64%. Hospital length of stay was 4.35 days for open, 1.42 days for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy compared to 1. 3 days for dVP. And finally, for asthmatic scriptures where the open prostatectomy rate was 12%, minimally invasive radical prostatectomy 15.2% compared to 0.54% with dVP, the significant of which has direct implications to desired urinary function. The two takeaways for me, from this study are as follows. First, the addition of the recently issued robotic specific DRG code will help to erase the misleading element of blending and reporting laparoscopic and robotic outcomes as similar. And second, the clinical outcomes between open prostatectomy and dVP are perhaps greater than we previously thought. The second study appeared in the August edition of Gynecologic Oncology and was offered... authored by Doctors Gary and Vagus, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The authors' aim was to assess the most effective minimally invasive surgical treatment for endometrial cancer operations for obese and morbidly obese patients. Within this cohort, they compared traditional laparoscopic outcomes performed by laparoscopically skilled surgeons to their da Vinci outcomes. Obese and morbidly obese women are at a much higher risk of developing endometrial cancer and, according to this study, represents 33% of all U.S. women. The results of the study were as follows. For both the obese and morbidly obese patient, robotic surgery was associated with shorter operative times, 189 versus 215 minutes, less blood loss, 50 versus 150 milliliters, increased lymph node retrieval 31.4 versus 24 and shorter hospitalization. The authors' conclusion and I quote, Robotic surgery is a useful tool for comprehensive surgical staging for obese and morbidly obese women with endometrial cancer. As this patient population is at increased risk of death from all causes, including post-operative complications, all efforts should be made to improve their outcomes. The same University of North Carolina Group also published a comparative 322 patients study on endometrial cancer treatments which appeared in the October edition of the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The purpose of this study was to compare total abdominal hysterectomy or TAH, total laparoscopic hysterectomy or TLH and da Vinci Hysterectomy or dVH within all clinical areas. When comparing para-aortic node retrieval between the three groups, they reported an average yield of three nodes within their TAH as their total abdominal hysterectomies. 6.3 nodes within their TLHs compared to 12 para-aortic lymph nodes within their da Vinci patients. When they compare total lymph node retrievals, they reported 14.9 within their TAHs, 23.1 within their TLHs and 32.9 within their da Vinci hysterectomies. Estimated blood loss between the three groups was as follows. 266 milliliters for their TAH patients, 145 for their TLH patients compared to 74 milliliters for their da Vinci hysterectomy patients. Length of hospitalization was reduced from an average of 4.4 days for their TAH patients to 1.2 days for their TLH patients to 1.0 days for the da Vinci hysterectomy patients, which led to the authors' conclusion, and I quote Total robotic hysterectomy with staging is feasible and preferable over total abdominal hysterectomy and may be preferable over total laparoscopic hysterectomy. This is a very strong endorsement especially so when you consider that the overwhelming majority of these procedures are performed through open incisions. My final reference is also specific to da Vinci's value within GYN Oncology and was authored by Dr. Limbandu and Harvingale [ph] from the Institute of Peritectomy [ph] in Marcey, France. And it appeared in the August edition of Surgical Endoscopy. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of GYN cancer surgery with the da Vinci S System. The patients underwent procedures consisting of total hysterectomy, bilateral inpherectomy [ph] and/or lumbo-aortic lymphadenectomy for endometrial, cervical or ovary cancer. Following the analysis of their data, the authors concluded by saying in a quote as suggested in the literature, the use of robotic laparoscopy leads to less blood loss, less post-operative pain and shorter hospitalizations days compared with those treated by more traditional surgical approaches. Despite the need for extensive studies robotic-assisted surgery seems to represent a similar technological evolution as the laparoscopic approach 50 years ago. All of these studies discussed da Vinci hysterectomy cancer outcomes. And I think it's important to reiterate that our fastest growing GYN procedure both in terms of absolute growth as well as percentage growth is dVH for benign conditions. That concludes my update and I'll now turn the time over to Ben.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: Thank you Aleks. I will be providing our updated 2008 financial forecast on a GAAP reporting basis, including non-cash FAS 123R stock compensation expenses. I will also provide an estimate of our stock compensation charges separately, so you can calculate meaningful comparisons that exclude these non-cash expenses. Based on our third quarter results we're increasing our previous guidance for revenue and profits for 2008. Starting with procedures, our dVH procedures are the greatest contributor to our overall procedure growth. We continue to expect our dVH procedures to grow approximately 150% in 2008 over 2007. With regard to dVP procedures, as Aleks mentioned, our growth in dVP lagged behind our expectations particularly in Europe. We continue to see dVP growth but lower than our previous forecast. We expect our worldwide dVP growth for 2008 to be greater than 30% over 2007. Other procedures, such as nephrectomies, partial nephrectomies, cystectomies and sacral colpopexies are growing much faster. And as a result, our Q3 procedures in total were in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect our total procedures to grow 57% to 58% this year from a base of approximately 85,000 total procedures performed in 2007. This is a reiteration of our forecast from the previous earnings call. Our instrument and accessory revenues are driven by procedures performed and typically grow in unison with procedures. As Marshall mentioned earlier, our revenues per procedure have come down slightly. This was caused by two factors: first, initial stocking orders continuing to comprise a lower proportion of total instrument and accessory revenues as our installed base continues to grow. Secondly, as customers increase their utilization rates, they've become more efficient in their use of consumable supplies. As a result, all procedures are expected to grow 57% to 58% this year. We are forecasting our instrument and accessory revenues to grow 55% to 56% which is down slightly from our previous forecast of 57% to 58%. System revenues in Q3 were stronger than we previously expected. We are now forecasting our system revenues to grow 45% to 46% over 2007, which is up from our previous forecast of 38% to40% growth. Our system ASP was approximately $1.37 million in Q3 compared to $1.35 million in Q2 and $1.32 million in Q1. As we have mentioned in previous calls, our system ASP fluctuates quarter-to-quarter as a result of geographic and product mix. On a year-to-date basis, our system ASP has averaged $1.35 million, and we expect it to remain at approximately at this level for the reminder of the year. Service revenues in Q3 were higher than we expected due to service and training fees generated outside of annual contracts. We expect total service revenues to grow 49% to 50%, above 2007 levels. Our previous estimate was 45% to 46%. Our average annual service revenue per installed system, including fees outside of annual contracts is approximately $140,000 per year. In summary, we are increasing our top-line revenue forecast for 2008. We now expect revenues to grow 49% to 50% over 2007, which is up from our previous estimate of 45% to 47%. With regard to gross profit margin, our Q3 margins were sequentially higher than Q2 due to better gross margins on service revenue. We expect our total gross margin to be approximately 71% for the year. This is up from our previous forecast of 70%. Moving to operating expense and starting with R&D, we expect total R&D expense to come in at approximately $82 million for the year, up approximately 68% from $49 million spent in R&D expense last year. With regard to SG&A expense, we expect total SG&A expense to grow 49% to 50%, which is up from our previous forecast of 48% to 49% growth, due to higher variable costs associated with higher revenue forecast. We expect total operating expense to grow 53% to 54%. We expect operating income to grow 53% to 54% for the year. Last quarter, we were forecasting operating income to grow 42% to 44% for the year. The improvement in our operating income is being driven by higher revenue forecast and higher gross margins coupled with only a modest increase in SG&A expense. These forecasts include the impact of FAS 123R stock compensation expense. We expect to require approximately $76 million as stock compensation charges for the year, broken down as follows: $11 million in cost of goods sold, $17 million in R&D expense and $48 million in SG&A expense. We are forecasting other income to come in between $24 million and $25 million. This is down slightly from our previous estimate of approximately $26 million due to foreign exchange losses we recorded in the third quarter. This forecast does not assume any foreign exchange gains or losses in the fourth quarter nor does it include any potential charges associated with the UBS auction rate securities offer that Marshall mentioned earlier. With regard to income tax, we reported a GAAP tax rate of approximately 36% for the third quarter, down from previous quarters of 39% due to R&D tax credits realized on our 2007 tax return. Earlier this month, the U.S. government approved an extension on R&D tax credits for 2008. As Marshall mentioned, we expect to record a benefit in Q4 associated with this tax credit. So, we do not have a specific estimate of the amount at this time. Excluding this benefit, we expect to record a tax rate of approximately 39% in Q4. And once again, we expect our effective cash tax expense to be approximately 20% for 2008. And finally, regarding shares outstanding for calculating EPS for Q4, we expect the share count to be between 40 million and 40.5 million shares. That concludes our prepared remakes and we will now open the call to your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Sean Levin. Sir, your line is open.
Sean Levin - Lazard Capital: Thank you. Congratulations on another strong quarter.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: Thanks Sean.
Sean Levin - Lazard Capital: Sure. My first question has to do with hysterectomy. We have done a lot of survey work here, and it seems that the simple procedures, as you said, seem to picking up quite a bit of steam here. In the past, you have mainly talked about looking malignant or complex procedures. We are wondering if you could you could give a little bit more detail on what you are seeing on the benign or simple arena.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think I would even make a different distinction. I don't think benign by definition means simple. There are complex benign and we are seeing a lot of traction within both complex benign and I think by definition all malignant which is also complex. That remains our initial target. There is no question about it. We have the highest value to add within those complex surgeries. We have, however, seen centers that flipped the majority and in some cases all of their hysterectomies to da Vinci. But in terms of where we are targeting, where we believe the highest value is, it really boils down to our patient value equation and that really is in the complex hysterectomy, which by our definition, is probably over around the 0.24 million of procedures U.S.
Sean Levin - Lazard Capital: Okay. And then just one other question on the Power Medical deal that you announced during the quarter. Could you give us some timeline on products on this and what procedures might benefit?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I'll take the second part and then I'll turn the first part over to Gary Guthart. The second part in terms of the procedures that might benefit from it. If look at the tools that are used throughout surgery as surgical stapling is found in many surgical specialties and you will find general surgery, thoracic surgery, GYN, GYN/oncology, urology and so and so forth. So many of those procedures in many of those specialties have da Vinci within them. However it is just not a perfect choreography between the stapling application and the general dissection and reconstruction and visualization. So the answer is, we think it will potentially have a place in multiple specialties. Colorectal is an area where there is a lot of stapling, lung resections, a lot of stapling. And we will see ultimately when you get it. But there are plenty of targets we believe. Now as far as the actual development I'll let Gary comment on that.
Gary S. Guthart - President and Chief Operating Officer: On the development side it's not a simple integration, it's a fairly complex product. And so we're... we don't have a shift date to share with you but don't anticipate in the next call to 18 months.
Sean Levin - Lazard Capital: All right, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tao Levy. Your line is open.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Good afternoon. And so I guess obviously the pre-requisite question, obviously great quarter here but what's the economic crisis, credit environment, how do we factor or how do you guys factor that into your fourth quarter and 2008 thinking, you're seeing much or any impact? Thanks.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well Tao, I wish I had a crystal ball, I am sure you do too.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Me too yes exactly.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You guys probably more than we do. Clearly, it's not a positive for anyone. We haven't seen a significant impact yet, and that's all I can say is yet. We are... in some ways, we are in an excellent position in that our procedures are not procedures that you just casually do. These are procedures that people need to have. I think we offer a compelling value to the patients and therefore they will seek this especially in anytime. And I guess, the other point I think is that, this is the time when I'm delighted that we're not a levered company. We don't have a bunch of debt. We have a lot of cash, and I think that gives us flexibility. I think that in this... in ugly times and this is certainly one of them, there are also opportunities. And so and those will... I can't get specific. And I am not sure that we have seen them yet. But we are certainly... we will be thoughtful to the things that will help us to build the our franchise in robotically assisted surgery. So the answer is I don't know any better than you do. I mean, I look at the volatility of the markets, incredible highs and incredible lows. Clearly the market isn't valuing fundamentals much anymore, but running on a motion. And so, until that settles down, until... and the market settles down, we will see. But I think that we are... most of our hospitals, we haven't seen a ton of them and Ben and Aleks can deal with this better than I can in terms of doing leases. But I suspect that may increase. Our leasing companies still have an appetite for these devices and so we'll see how it plays out. In the meantime, we will manage the business in as prudent and thoughtful way as we can and be in a position to do as well as we can during these times and hopefully very well. And be in position long-term to continually to build this franchise in the marketplace.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Strategy: Yes, Tao,just to comment on last part of your question, from what we see today, we expect Q4 to be again a sequentially higher quarter than we had in Q3. Again, Q4 tends to be our strongest quarter of the year. And that is reflected in our guidance.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: And in terms of feedback from the sales force, in terms of like sort of cancellations or delays in orders, anything that's a different than what you may have seen you call it three months ago or it's always challenging?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I'll ask Jerry to give you his thoughts on that.
Jerry McNamara - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales & Marketing: Well we're reservedly optimistic, we came off a good quarter of pipeline, closing and pipeline development. And reports backed from the field suggest that, that's continuing. We're in a dynamic time. We're just going to work through it.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Great and just I have one question also... my final question on procedures. Now that you're adding more systems and it seems like did the procedure number came in line with expectations maybe little bit slower internationally. It seemed like maybe that seasonally adjusted. As you place more systems in this quarter obviously exceeded expectations there. Is the idea that you'll see, obviously as these hospitals have more systems, more cases being done robotically. Is that kind of the right way to think about that you'll see automatic growth from on the procedure front because there are more systems out there?
Jerry McNamara - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales & Marketing: What I would say there is generally speaking, yes but in terms of following some linearity, I think that's where it becomes difficult. To say that a system is placed here therefore, procedure should grow by some fixed percentage, is just an algorithm that doesn't work out. There is a lot of... as you know in our key procedures, the patients are very important in terms of determining where they're going to have their surgery done. So how things happen in a particular market, it's just not a perfect science yet.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: One other thing I'd just point out to and I think I mentioned this to couple people before. You got to remember we have over thousand systems out there, 1030 or so. And if we place two or three more than what somebody thought I mean that mathematically does not turn into a significantly different metric that you're going to calculate in terms of procedures.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Tao.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. David Lewis. Sir, your line is open.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon. One question here, I just... strategically if we think about the last couple of question quarters, I don't know if you've broken out specifically but this quarter was around 50 greenfield aversion systems, is that about right out?
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Actually it'll be higher than that. 15 out of 86 went to individual customer. So, it was probably closer to 70.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: Yes. So, there is a lot... for whatever reason globally speaking.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: I was saying just U.S. but the point is straight quarters in U.S. market received 40 to 50 new systems. I'm trying to understand this reacceleration which is exciting and positive. Can you give me a sense of the size of these hospitals, these last sorts of 90 U.S. boxes versus had the repeat customers. Just give me a flavor for what transition is happening in your business. Is this a proxy for the sales force additions you made back half '07. Our new business strategy are just simply doing down market or they were just sort of a lot of under penetrated customers that are roughly the same size as your old customers.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well it's interesting, we do as you know look at those statistics. And I can say within the United States market, we had 71 placements. So if you backed out the 15... and I believe all of the repeats were U.S. denominated. So that would give you 56 greenfields now. 51, I am sorry. And so when you look at the makeup of those hospitals, we had 33 of them that were over 325 beds. We had 28 of them which were in what we've called a middle tier which is 200 to 325 beds and we had 10 that were in hospitals below 200 beds. So again I think it falls in line with our thinking that... as da Vinci will find the procedures and as you expand GYN, you tend to see procedures, those procedures that are done in smaller hospitals. So it might surprise some people that 10 of those placements went to hospitals less than 200 beds. I know it's a dynamic situation but I think across the board that spread is pretty good, and I think it speaks to its value, da Vinci's value in hospitals regardless of size.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Okay. So clearly, the technology is broadening maybe to second inflection point. In terms of downstream implications here, I mean number one, should we expect that utilization for this new system to slightly lower than old systems, just by sheer hospital size and do we think these new hospital customers are more or less insulated from any type credit cycle crunch if it would have materialized?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Strategy: I will take a solid utilization, and so far we haven't seen any difference in utilization. On average worldwide it's about 150 procedures per system. And everyone is buying a system, has a clinical plan for utilization of that system. So it's not looking as far as we can tell so far that the new buyers are using it any less than let's say the average buyers from before.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And I would also just remind you of the fact that the hospital size does not directly correlate to our utilization numbers. I can think of two hospitals, one being City of Hope Cancer Center which is one of the busiest and the handful of hospitals, we have as one of the busiest we have anywhere in the world as is the hospitals in Celebration, Florida, which is also about 130 beds. So it doesn't directly relate but it is something we again continually go through the data.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Okay. That's very helpful and just one last question and I'll hop. At the risk of being sort of globally insensitive here, I wonder the European slowdown, the European traction that looks like a little less active than we'd have expected. Is this a simply a European thing where we're seeing classic medical device lagged effect overseas or is there something that you didn't not anticipate that pass to overseas [ph]?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Do youwant to answer to it?
Jerry McNamara - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales & Marketing: Yes. We manage the pipeline and we have variability quarter-to-quarter. We have a very strong pipeline in Europe and our quarter was what it was and we still have strong expectations going forward.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I guess my comment is that the Europe is impacted both in procedures and just getting deals done during the summer because they take so much time off during the summer. I think we saw most... more of that directly in Europe not the rest of the world. And so I really look into the pipeline as Jerry says and we'll see, we also find that we are little less capable of predicting the exact time of close in Europe than we are here at. It tends to be a little more bureaucratic in the process, and I don't want to be insensitive here either. But it does tend to be little more bureaucratic in the process. And so you can get snag and move it over to next quarter pretty easily. And so that's kind of the nature of the beast.
Gary S. Guthart - President and Chief Operating Officer: and I will say from a procedure adoption standpoint what we have experienced in some of our procedures and this continues also within GYN is that it does trail the United States in terms of its uptick of steepness on adoption curves. We saw it in dVP. We saw it in some of the other procedures. We're seeing it in GYN. The US uptick of GYN is significantly steeper than the European. Now, that isn't alarming and probably for someone like yourself who has followed these things over the years, that's almost to be expected. So I think the combination of all of that in a pretty slow summer in Europe led to a little lagging behind.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Great. Well thanks for the color.
Gary S. Guthart - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our Next question comes from Rick Wise. Your line is open sir.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Rick?
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Hi, how you doing?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Just wanted to touch on utilization. Do you mean if you expand little more on the dVP weakness in Europe and just beyond seasonality and I'm not sure I remember seasonality in the past, can you help --
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We always have seasonality in the past.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Okay. So that's not unusual but utilization for instrument still seeing a little tad liner. Any other color or anything else we should understand?
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: I think if you take a look back at third quarter of last year you would probably calculate that the utilization per system also was flattish, if not slightly down. So what we saw on third quarter of this year is actually pretty similar to what we saw on third quarter of last year. That said, we are watching it, and particularly in Europe and as Lonnie mentioned not in other parts of the world. We saw somewhat pronounced seasonality.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Yes. Although not in terms of placements fairly.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But yes. In fact I'd say that the seasonality in the United States was less this year than was last year.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Yes.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But, strong, but clearly stronger.
Jerry McNamara - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales & Marketing: It always becomes harder for us to use international as a single body of land. So I mean it was in countries we saw it more pronounced and then other we saw less pronounced. So and we saw some pretty good strength in non-European, specifically some of the Asian markets. So it's hard to lump into one, into sort of one stereotype.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Okay. And again maybe just reflect a little more, Lonnie or Aleks, the whole capital spending trends just... where you think we're over the next six to 12 months. And we keep... I keep reading the times and we're doing surveys and we're really getting a lot of conflicting messages, just again your larger picture.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: As I said, as I started out and when I talked to Tao, I wished we had a crystal ball, we don't. I think this thing is from day to today whether it will... I mean, the one thing we have is we have a very... the governments throughout world are taking very aggressive interventional action as you saw today in Switzerland. And trying to learn from what went wrong in prior situations like this. And I think that the exact timing of how this will play out over the next few months. I guess, Rick, you got to ask me and you came here and said what's the next quarter look like? And you remember my response? If you're buying the stock for the next quarter, and my point is, I understand. I don't know if this is a one quarter deal or it's a two quarter deal or it's a year or two, but we will come out stronger and here we'll deal with the performance near term as best we can and in the long-term we will come out stronger that's... but I just don't have... I wish I knew, I just don't know. I mean I think it's just situation specific.
Jerry McNamara - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales & Marketing: Rick, specific to the hospitals rather than sort of the macro space.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Sure.
Jerry McNamara - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales & Marketing: I mean, even listening to the debates last night and listening to two candidates that were talking about healthcare and healthcare spending and reducing system wide costs. When you look at our value preposition which is in directed capital expenditures, I think from a hospital standpoint in macroeconomics, we're setting a pretty good position in that the procedures that we are focused on are necessary. They are not elective procedures. And for the most part very complex and a lot of our business is cancer specific. The value proposition for the hospital I think is pretty well documented on being able to increase flow in and in many in many instances, a decrease cost of the procedure and overall cost in their expenses. So, when it comes to how they are going to allocate their capital dollars, I think we're pretty good positioned but as far as really taking the guess at what the macro economics looks like it, your economists and your resources are going to be better at that for the year.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: Hey Rick, it's one other thing I'd mention. I'm putting this in because you and others have asked me this and Lonnie touched on it. This is question about leasing and because and it's connected with the availability of capital device systems, and there is something that we can probably shed some light on is historically we said about 15% of our systems have been leased. That's how it's actually increased a little bit over the past couple of quarters to closer to 20%. And according to our leasing partners it appears that the credit crunch is causing an increase in financed system purchases, because hospitals are turning to these leasing companies more since their other sources of funding have gotten a little bit tighter. Those leasing companies they tell us have plenty of capacity and we get calls from them all the time. So, just to address a series of questions we've had about financing and availability of capital, just want to say that there are certainly from our perspective availability from a leasing standpoint.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Ben, thank you for that, for your thorough response. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from MimiPham. Your line is open.
MimiPham - JMP Securities: Hi, good afternoon. I guess you sort of touch on this already but would you say that 100% or what percent of your total procedures done, year-to-date, would you consider as elective procedures?
Jerry McNamara - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales & Marketing: I wouldn't say that this is a 100%, I think the way I would think about it is... let's take a non-cancer procedure like hysterectomy, benign hysterectomy. So, if a woman is suffering from multiple fibroids, endometriosis, some combination there, and she is going through some very severe pain, theoretically could she put up with pain longer? Probably, I mean she is making some election that she could push it out a little bit but it isn't as let's say on the other side of the coin elective in the context of cosmetic procedures. So there is some variability to when it absolutely has to begin but by and large most of them are of that serious condition. And the cancer operations I think speak for themselves. So, it I wouldn't say that it's a 100% but it's the lion share of our business plan.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Mimi, just one comment. You know, this is an observation not a statement. But in prior lives, I can remember that we went through a significant recessions and people have potentially laid off their jobs, we actually saw an acceleration, where people were moving things forward while they were still insured and I don't know that will be case this time. But we did in terms of hospital stays and specific treatment. So you're just going to have to see how this plays out.
MimiPham - JMP Securities: Okay, and then in terms of CapEx spending potentially being just a tougher for the hospitals are you expecting longer lead times and generally more people administration be involved in the purchase decision going forward?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: At the present time we don't have any indicators that tell us that's the case if anything has changed but we're early into this.
MimiPham - JMP Securities: And then lastly I guess I know we have to wait till next quarter to get 2009 guidance but just looking at higher portion do you think you'll be using sort of when you look at your systems pipeline, will you be using little more conservative conversion rate than you've got in past years, just given the economy?
Unidentified Company Representative: Don't know.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: There is too much uncertainties this point for us predict that.
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think the base of our business, the core of our business is procedures and that's very healthy as Aleks was coloring out what's going on dVH, it's pretty clear that we're on a growth path on dVH.
MimiPham - JMP Securities: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Andrew. Your line is open, sir.
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon, it's actual Matt in for Ben. All I have just two real quick ones. The services gross margin in the quarter was obviously very good and on an absolute basis in terms of the costs over the last two quarters, it's been coming down. Should we expect a big catch up in Q4 or can you just give us little color on what's going on there?
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, you're right, you noticed in the past two quarters we've had better leverage if you will on our service. So couple things are going on there, we got higher service revenues. And we've been keeping our fixed costs pretty stable there. So, we've had better leverage on our fixed costs. And the other thing is, we're seeing the benefits of reliability improvements that we've been working on pretty much continuously. So what reliability improvement translates into is a reduced number of spare parts we need for repairs, reduced number of service calls we have to make and that's all being reflected in that better gross margin line.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then on your sales force expansion can you just real quick housekeeping, tell me the number again, I missed that when you gave in terms of the field sales force increases in the quarter?
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So, roughly speaking, I think we added about 20 people to the field and there is a few metrics that I think we report on for you guys. And it is about a total of 340 people now on the field and roughly speaking about 60 of those folks are focusing on selling systems. We got over 210 people that are focusing in on procedure growth. You got about, I think 65 people that service engineers and about 15 people that are in field training.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, would you say that the allocation between the two in terms of pricing systems and driving utilization has been changing recently or is that pretty much steady state?
Jerry McNamara - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales & Marketing: No we run that by set of metrics that's pretty much steady state.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just lastly given the scare that was on the stock with Mero [ph] recently, is there any update on the competitive front?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Really, I'll let Gary answer the question on many changes in the competitive front.
Gary S. Guthart - President and Chief Operating Officer: Nothing really big on that front. We continue to watch companies in Asia and in Europe. But I think nothing that really looks imminent.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ed Shenkan. Your line is open.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Co: Thanks. We recently surveyed 60 CEOs and CFOs of hospitals about the da Vinci and one thing they were anxious for is incremental reimbursement when they use da Vinci. Just wondering where we stand with insurers and CMS to get incremental reimbursement?
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. As a reminder I think we might have mentioned this before. So CMS starting October 1, so literally about 15 days ago, they've implemented these new ICD9 codes and what that does is now allow hospitals to now record, specifically when robotic procedure has been performed because remember before the DRG codes were pretty much the same for whether it was done open or da Vinci or laparoscopic or laparoscopic da Vinci we would be using the same code. So the idea here is for them to capture that data on robotic surgery. And what we expect going to happen is over the next two years they're going to collect data and then after that we will see what they do with that data.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That now I think those administrators that you're referring to, I suspect and in fact we've already seen some signs of this where in... aside from Medicare patients they will use that risk data to try to seek high reimbursement from some of other third-party payers and now they have a vehicle to do that. Whether and how successful they are going to be is going to depend on the various plans, but at least we are in the point now where they can literally give pure transparent data and make a case for why they may deserve higher reimbursement, so that's the first step.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Co: And with regard to mitral valve repair, da Vinci is getting used more here and makes as we're talking to docs repairs easier, and when will we get closer to an inflection point when we will start to see even more utilization in mitral valve?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Strategy: That's a little harder to predict and specifically I think if you would ask me about, if you ask that same question within any cardiac procedure, I think it is just difficult for us to say. I think you're right on in that there are lot of doctors who are now aware of the patient value and the physician sort of friendliness of da Vinci within those complex operations. Mitro valve is not just that they're becoming easier, they'll be able to do more complex repairs and are seeing fewer replacements required. So that word is really starting get out, it's been a slow steady growth for us. And there are some really key centers and we've talked about them in the past, places like the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic, very generally speaking conservative places that have really adopted this. And we will expect that to continue. But to predict what the inflection point looks like is really hard for us to do.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But this again viral and as we -- as awareness builds, and as Aleks says places like the Cleveland Clinic and others are doing to really do help that. And what constantly find situations where patients... there's a fellow who just wrote a book. I picked it up on Internet that was on his mitral valve is asymptomatic runner real athletic guy. And we've connected with him and already patients, have come to them that they go to their first cardiologist, they don't know anything about it. Their first response is kind of well, you're out of Canada for this rather than saying I don't know much about it. But as that awareness grows, I think we will see it. And then I think it will be true also with revask as especially with some of the data that's coming out and both for stents and the data coming out for revask. We have time for one more question?
Operator: Yes sir. Our last question today comes from Amit Hazan. Your line is open sir.
Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer: Thanks very much. I just have a couple if you'll bear with me. First of all, on prostate, just, it's on prostate, full questions, and I will ask my first one. I think you were talking if I recall in the 2nd quarter, 35% growth during the first half of the year for prostate procedures. And so, now, if we look at the 30% that implies of course the much bigger slowdown than we anticipated. In fact, if we run the numbers that's about 3 to 5000 procedures decline versus the last time that you gave guidance. And so, I am wondering if you can focus on the U.S. in particular because I'm guessing that has to come at least a little bit from the U.S. And let us know what is going there that's coming below your expectation.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Let me make a comment on that. I mean and you are right. As we plot the adoption curve we clearly are now on the upper quadrant of the adoption curve. If you assume kind of the open procedures that we're taking all open procedures. So, with that growth was slow. I mean it's just the nature of an adoption curve. As it slows as you reach up into that. Now as we penetrate or the next phase of dVP will largely depend on how successful we are at penetrating alternative treatment modalities. And those will be tougher. The adoption will be slower because you have in French competitors, they are going to fight hard, to resist that. You don't have an organized competitor in open to resist. So, I think that will slow a bit. But I think that it is a function and I just recently updated all of our adoption curves and we are not that we always have a seasonal drop in the third quarter. We will see what the fourth quarter looks like but it comes back under the line it will be on, which I'm suspect it will because every third quarter it's off the line. It comes right back, we've got a very, I mean a very consistent adoption curve going. Now that said that is... I believe is primarily for the open procedures and the next segment we'll penetrating I think will be slower and high resistance but time will tell.
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The other thing I would fill in there is we've always talked about international, and we quite fall into this ourselves is that we tend to characterize international as one big group. It's really not it, it's a lot of different places. And so it's kind of hard to predict what that growth rate is country-to-country. It's still definitely growing. So we are again forecasting over 30% growth year-over-year on the 55,000 procedures we did last year. So it's still a significant growth.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'll tell you another thing, another place we've got such growth in GYN that the field resources are being sucked right into GYN. And quite frankly it's part of our strategy. As we look at adoption curve and the lower portion of the adoption curve, the lower half that is primarily push, I mean it's sales driven. I mean sales, we got to get the systems placed, we've got to get surgeons trained. We got to build the infrastructure that can support the procedure. In the later part of the adoption curve we believe that it's marketing driven because if we are now... we now have hospital with the system, we have surgeons who're trained and now we need to help continue to build awareness and to help them to draw patients into to be... for the surgeons to perform surgery on. So, I think that it's also a shift, and dVP is our maiden voyage in many ways in terms of the first major procedure to drive to standard of care.
Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer: Thanks to that. And if I can ask actually the question in a different, from a different angle, just to kind of get your thoughts on it. With regard to your clinical sales force and if you can remind us how much you've in fact increased them by this year. But if you are not hitting the procedure number and you've increased them by as much as you have, and the dVH guidance that you've given for procedures hasn't really increased this year. How do we think about of the clinical sales force and the sales, the procedure per sales force or how you think about that and is there something there that you're thinking about doing differently or just color around that would be great?
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Couple of clarifications for you Amit. So one is actually from a total procedures standpoint from the beginning of the year, we have increased our guidance. So in fact, when we started off the year we thought we might be going somewhere around 50 or so percent on total procedures, we now think we're growing 57% to 58%. And that clinical sales force that you are talking about and Lonnie was talking about, they go after all procedures not just dVPs, so anyway where we have been adding people in the field and in terms of the metrics that Jerry was talking about before. And what we're pleased with the productivity of those clinical sales people
Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks very much.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. That's our last question for today. As I have said in our prior calls that we believe the adoption is driven by a significant shift in patient value, which is a function of improved surgical outcomes with new surgical trauma. It is our goal to deliver value in the following order, first to the patients, as we discussed, second, to the surgeons, third to the hospitals, fourth to our employees. And if we do these four things we believe will bring value to our shareholders. And by the every one of our employees is a shareholder. Two weeks ago, I met with surgeons in several large East coast university medical centers. On doing this trip, I spoke with two chiefs of gynecology that have become major da Vinci users. I mentioned these two because of their contrasting perspective, one is in his mid 40s and a highly skilled laparoscopic surgeon. He said that he had converted to da Vinci surgery for two reasons; first he is seeing... he said that he had a seen a dramatic reduction in pain and improvement in the speed of recovery of his patients, even patients he operated on a very end of the day and early evening, he said were ready to go home at 11 o'clock the next morning. The second reason he said is he experienced major reduction in his own muscular and skeletal pain associated with performing surgery day after day with conventional laparoscopic instruments. The second surgeon is in his mid to late 50s probably closer to his late 50s. He describes himself as a very fast and effective large incision surgeon, with no interest in laparoscopic. And he established a case until it was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which he had removed with the da Vinci system. He was so amazed with the speed of his recovery that he became to reconsider the benefits the da Vinci might bring to his own patients. And he says he is now a very fast and effective small incision robotic surgeon. The last story, kind of relates to the question that was raised about cardiac and mitral valve adoption, last story is sister of one of our engineers was diagnosed with Endoscopic Mitral Valve disease. She is physical runner living in Southern California, she asked her cardiologist about the possibility for robotic repair and was told that she was not a candidate and center surgeon re-planned to perform the surgery to a large incision, that's true anatomy. Her brother suggested that she get a second opinion, so she spoke with Alfredo Franto [ph] who is the director of the cardiovascular surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He repaired a mitral valve with the da Vinci system. Shared a great outcome and return to our cardiologist a few weeks later. He was surprised that I have learned a lot of surgery. He was so impressed with the results but he said he would refer all future patients to Dr. Franto [ph] at Cedar-Sinai. It is always great to hear these patient stories but even better when someone close to member of our Intuitive family. In closing, we remain committed to delivering exceptional value in terms of improve surgical outcomes, reduce surgical trauma for our patients and exceptional operating performance for our shareholders. We're committed to focusing on the vital few things that truly make a difference as we strive to take surgery as the human have. That concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and sport in this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talk with you again in three months.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Next, Aleks will discuss sales and marketing highlights, then I'll provide an update to our financial forecast for 2008 and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'd like to introduce Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you for joining us today. This past quarter, we continued to drive and broaden the adoption of robotically-assisted surgery resulting in significant top and bottom line growth. Operating highlights for the second quarter is as follows. We sold 85 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 56 sold during the second quarter of last year. 24 of the systems sold were to existing customers. Our international team contributed 19 of 85 systems sold, up from 13 last year. We ended the second quarter with 946 da Vinci Surgical Systems installed worldwide. Procedured adoption, it continues to be procedure specific, patient driven and the primary growth driver of our business. We had a solid quarter-over-quarter procedure growth in all significant specialties again led by GYN. Based upon our numbers, da Vinci Prostatectomy has now become the number one treatment for prostate cancer in the United States. Among our fastest growing procedures in terms of percent, sequential quarter-to-quarter growth were Nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy for kidney cancer, radical cystectomy for bladder cancer, hysterectomy, myomectomy and sacral colpopexy. Total revenue grew to $219 million, up 56% from last year, Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $74 million, up 61%. Total recurring revenue including service grew to $103 million, up 56% from the prior year comprising 47% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $98 million, 45% of revenue before non-cash 123R stock option expense, up 80% from the second quarter of last year. GAAP net income grew to $51 million, 23% of revenue, up 67% from last year. We ended the quarter with $740 million in cash and investments, up $40 million from the last quarter and up $292 million in the last 12 months. After subtracting $8 million in cash received for an exercise of stock options, and adding back $54 million invested in fixed assets, purchased intellectual property, and working capital during the quarter, our gross operating cash flow in the second quarter amounted to 168% of our reported GAAP net income. Our new instrument plant in Mexicali, Mexico came on line, where production in Q2 and Q3 and we grew our Intuitive team by 76 members to 935. With that, I will pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Lonnie. Total second quarter revenue of $219.2 million increased 56% compared with $140.2 million for the second quarter of 2007, and increased 16% compared with $188.2 million for the first quarter of 2008. Second quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $73.6 million, up 61% compared with $45.8 million last year, and 19% compared with $61.9 million last quarter. The growth rate in instruments and accessories is comparable to the direct result of our procedure growth rates. The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we earn per procedure remained relatively unchanged between $1,500 and $2,000 per procedure for established da Vinci accounts, and $2,000 to $2,300 per procedure if you include initial stocking orders. Systems revenue of $116.1 million increased 57% compared with $74.1 million last year and increased 17% compared with $99.1 million last quarter. The increase in systems revenue compared with the first quarter of 2008 reflects increased unit sales as well as an increase in the average revenue per system. Second quarter da Vinci Surgical System revenue reflects the sale of 85 systems compared with 56 systems sold during the second quarter of last year, and 74 systems sold in the first quarter. 70 of the systems sold in the quarter were our latest S model, incorporating high definition vision capability. Seven were four-arm S models incorporating standard vision capabilities, four were three-arm S models and four were refurbished standard systems. 19 of the systems sales were outside of the United States compared with 20 in the first quarter. Six of the systems sales in the quarter included trading. Our second quarter average revenue per system including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades was $1.35 million, which is $30,000 more than the average revenue per system in the first quarter of 2008. The higher average revenue per system primarily reflects a favorable geographic mix, and to a lesser extent the higher proportions of our sales being direct sales to European customers which are denominated in euros. Upgrades, including fourth arms and HD accounted for $1.5 million of the current quarter systems revenue compared with $1.6 million last quarter. Service revenue increased to $29.4 million, up 44% compared with $20.4 million last year and up 8% compared with $27.2 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total second quarter recurring revenue comprise of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to $103 million, up 56% compared with the second quarter of 2007 and up 16% compared with the first quarter of 2008. Recurring revenue represented 47% of the total revenue in both the second and first quarters of 2008. Revenue outside the United States represented 20% of total second quarter revenue compared with 23% in the first quarter, reflecting higher revenue growth in the U.S. relative to outside the U.S. Our second quarter 2008 gross margin of 71.2% is higher than the 69% realized in the first quarter, reflecting higher average selling prices per system, reduced cost associated with certain system components and increased absorption. Operating costs included initial start-up costs for Mexico, which began production in July. In the current year, these start-up costs will be more than offset by the otherwise lower costs, but will be... will more than offset the otherwise lower cost of production in Mexico. Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2008 were $77.9 million compared with $64.9 million in the first quarter of 2008. Sequential operating expense increase of $13 million reflects non-cash 123R stock compensation of $4.5 million. Increased commissions on increased revenue, cost associated with increased headcount and cost associated with increased R&D activities. We added 76 employees during the second quarter, ending the period with 935 regular employees. The majority of the additions were to our worldwide manufacturing and sales and support organizations. Second quarter 2008 operating income was $78.2 million or 35.7% of sales compared with $64.9 million or 34.5% of sales for the first quarter of 2008. Second quarter operating income included $19.7 million of 123R stock compensation expense compared with $14.6 million in the first quarter. The increase of $5.1 million reflects the fourth quarter impact of our annual stock grant made on February 15th, compared to a partial impact in the first quarter. Our second quarter 2008 other income was $5.7 million, which is significantly lower than the $8.5 million realized in the first quarter, reflecting lower interest rates on our investment portfolio. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 39%, which is consistent with our tax rate in the first quarter. We continue to utilize carry forward tax benefits and employees stock related tax benefits in 2008 and expect our cash outlay for income taxes will be approximately 20% of pre-tax income for 2008. Our net income of $51.2 million or $1.28 per share increased 67% compared with $30.7 million or $0.79 per share for the second quarter of 2007, and increased 14% compared with $44.8 million or $1.12 per share for the first quarter of 2008. Let me quickly summarize our results for the first six months of 2008. Total revenue for the first six months of 2008 was $407.4 million, up 60% compared with $254.5 million last year. Operating income for the first six months of 2008 was $143.1 million, up 80% compared with $79.4 million last year. Operating income included $34.3 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first six months of 2008 compared with $17.5 million in 2007. Net income for the first six months of 2008 was $96 million or $2.40 per share, up 76% compared with $54.5 million or $1.41 per share last year. Now, turning your attention to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter of 2008 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $740 million, up $40 million from March 31st, 2008. $8.3 million of the cash generated in the quarter was associated with stock purchase activities. The remaining cash generated is primarily related to operating activities. The $40 million is net of $45.1 million of capital expenditures, which included $17.4 million associated with the purchase of property in Sunnyvale, where we are building a new 154,000 square foot manufacturing and engineering building. $20 million associated with the purchase of intellectual property rights and expenditures associated with facilities improvements and information technology infrastructure to support our growth. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $162.1 million at June 30 compared with $135.7 million at March 31st, 2008. The change in receivables reflects higher revenue in the second quarter and the timing of customer purchases relative to our quarter cut-off. Our net inventory increased to $42.6 million at June 30 compared with $38.8 million at March 31, 2008. Our inventory turns at June 30, 2008 of 5.7 time, was comparable to the 5.8 turns at the end of the previous quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales. Aleks?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: Thank you, Marshall. During the second quarter, we sold 85 da Vinci systems; 66 in the United States, 14 in Europe and five in rest of world markets. A total of 6 systems were part of sales, trading transactions. The net 79 new system installs brings to 946, the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide; 710 in the U.S., 159 in Europe and 77 in rest of world markets. 18 of the 79 net systems installed during the quarter represented repeat systems sales to existing customers, which brings to 110 the total number of customers which own 2 or more da Vinci systems. 70 of the 85 total system sold were da Vinci S HD systems. Internationally, we had another solid quarter, which included 3 more da Vinci placements into Switzerland, 2 into Sweden and our first da Vinci placements into the countries of Argentina, Cyprus and Qatar. Additionally, we were notified by the State Food and Drug Administration in the Peoples Republic of China that da Vinci S has been granted regulatory clearance which allows us to begin marketing the S system throughout China. Clinically, we had an excellent quarter, a quarter in which we experienced strong sequential procedure growth within all of our targeted surgical specialties both in the U.S. and internationally. And for the first time, our overall gynecologic procedure business registered both the largest sequential percentage growth as well as the largest absolute procedure growth for the quarter. This growth was led by da Vinci Hysterectomy and sacral colpopexy. Our urology business showed solid growth, exceptionally so with in our Kidney and Bladder business mainly da Vinci Nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy and da Vinci Cystectomy. We also saw solid growth within our dVP business, particularly so internationally. Our da Vinci cardiac revascularization and Mitral Valve Repair business were also strong. In Q2, there are approximately 100 da Vinci related clinical papers published within various peer reviewed Journals throughout several surgical specialties. In addition, there were multiple scientific abstracts, clinical posters and podium presentations delivered within the various conferences we attended. The annual American Urology Association conference or AUA took place in May and was attended by nearly 13,000 urologists from around the world. da Vinci's imprint on the AUA has grown over the years to the point where dVP is now the most popular treatment for men with Prostate Cancer in the United States, and arguably, it's the most enabling product used within all urologic cancers, prostate, kidney, and bladder. At the AUA conference, 76 da Vinci presentations, abstracts, and posters were featured, 40 of which were focused on dVP alone, the remaining 36 reported on da Vinci Nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy, cystectomy, pyeloplasty as well as sacral colpopexy for Uro/GYN conditions. In parallel with these presentations were five AUA da Vinci post graduate or instructional courses, a pre-AUA advanced robotics course, a da Vinci satellites symposium and an international robotics cystectomy consortium program. Two of our fastest growing procedures are da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy and da Vinci Cystectomy. Though they are relatively new opportunities, multiple presentations focused on these complex cancer procedures. Due to the technical challenges, traditional laparoscopic approaches within these procedures are rarely performed, therefore the gold standard remains open surgery. The group headed by Dr. Raul O. Parra from Coopers Medical Center in New Jersey presented their initial 20 patients comparing da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy to open Nephrectomy. The author's introduction was as follows and Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy requires experience and a lengthy learning curve to successfully accomplish tumor excision. The advent of robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery has proven successful in Prostate Cancer surgery, encouraging a growing number of centers in adapting this technology in complex renal surgery. The study compared blood loss, operating time, pathologic outcomes and length of hospitalization. In their results, they reported that over time was a bit longer in their initial da Vinci cases, but their blood loss was reduced by over 50% and hospitalization was reduced by 43% with similar pathologic results. It's important to note that these were the group's initial cases, learning curve cases, but through their learning curve, they showed strong clinical results. Two of the cystectomy presentations at AUA caught our attention and both were by Dr. Doug Scherr and his group out of Cornell University Hospital in New York. The first study prospectively compared perioperative and pathologic outcomes in 70 consecutive patients undergoing open radical cystectomy and da Vinci Cystectomy. The study compared operating time, blood loss, transfusion rates, length of hospitalization, and cancer outcomes. The authors had this to say about their results. Our initial experience with robotic cystectomy suggests potential advantages compared to standard open approach, although operative duration was greater in the robotic group. Blood loss, transfusion requirement, and hospital stay were all decreased compared to the open cohort. The robotic method also demonstrated comparable early pathologic outcomes. Their second prospective study measured cost differences, both direct and indirect between open cystectomy and da Vinci Cystectomy. Their study compared cost within three distinct urinary diversion procedures. First, a cystectomy with an ileal conduit; second, a cystectomy with an Indiana pouch; and third, a cystectomy ileal neobladder. Despite the increased materials cost, da Vinci Cystectomy was shown to be less expensive than the open cystectomy across all three groups. The da Vinci ileal neobladder procedures registered an 8% cost savings, compared to open. da Vinci Indiana pouch, a 32% savings. And for da Vinci ileal conduits, a 42% cost savings. The largest cost driver in the study was hospital length of stay, where da Vinci patients systematically demonstrated shorter length of stay compared to open patients. The author's conclusion, and I quote Robotics cystectomy appears to be more cost efficient than open cystectomy as a treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer at a high volume tertiary care referral center despite an increase in materials cost. The cost benefit obtained from reduced length of stay with Robotics cystectomy is significant. On June 26th and 27th, the first worldwide robotic renal symposium was held at Washington University, in St. Louis. 115 surgeons from around the world attended this first ever event exclusively devoted to da Vinci renal surgery. The course was dedicated to offering practical techniques to enable surgeons to incorporate da Vinci renal surgery, into their practice, and included lectures and cases on a wide range of renal applications for robotics in radical nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy, pyeloplasty and adrenalectomy. The course featured four complete live surgery broadcast and during one of them Dr. Sam Biani [ph], the course director performed a da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy with one ischemic time of only 13 minutes. The patient left the hospital in two days and reported to have gone dancing one week later, and also reported to have used no pain medication once sent home. On the advantages of da Vinci renal surgery, Dr. Sam Biani [ph] had this to say, and I quote robotic renal surgery offers so many advantages over open and laparoscopic approaches. We are able to do more complex surgery and with fewer side effects such as shorter ischemic times and quicker return to normal activity. It is a revolution. As many of you know sacral colpopexy is a procedure performed by gynecologists, uro-gynecologist, and urologist to correct vaginal vault prolapse. The condition is very common and the gold standard corrective procedure is an open sacral colpopexy. The group out of the Mayo Clinic Rochester led by Doctors Chow and Siddique [ph] presented data on their first 42 da Vinci patients; 35 patients in their study had a minimum of a 12 month follow up with a mean follow up period of 36 months. All but one of their patients were released on post operative day one and one was released on post op day two. This compares very favorably to the open sacral colpopexy published by Richard which suggest a two to three day hospitalization. More important than hospitalization is procedure durability, which is one of the reasons that traditional laparoscopy is infrequently performed. The Mayo series show that the da Vinci Sacral Colpopexy is not only less invasive, but also highly durable. The author summarized by saying and I quote The robotic assisted laparoscopic sacral colpopexy is a minimally invasive technique for vaginal vault prolapse repair combining advantages of open sacral colpopexy with the decreased morbidity of laparoscopy. We found a decreased hospital stay, low complication rates, and high patient satisfaction with a minimum of one year follow up. But most importantly, the long term results of the robotic repair mirror those of the open repair with significantly less morbidity. In last month's edition of the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology doctors Payne and Daugherty [ph] from the Ochsner Clinic published a study comparing outcomes of total laparoscopic Hysterectomy to da Vinci Hysterectomy or dVH for benign conditions. The construct was a 200 consecutive patient retrospective analysis of their 100 most recent Hysterectomies prior to establishing the robotics program compared to their first 100 hysterectomies following the establishment of their robotics program. I would reference Dr. Payne and Dr. Daugherty's [ph] work in the past, but until now it had not been published within a leading clinical journal. There is seven page paper details of very key findings. For example, the number of patients that required an exploratory laparotomy with a total abdominal hysterectomy was 11 in the pre-robotic cohort and zero in the da Vinci cohort. These 11 were patients that upon initial review could not be treated either laparoscopically or vaginally. This resulted in an exploratory laparotomy and subsequent abdominal hysterectomy. There were zero similar events within the da Vinci cohort. In addition, intra-operative conversation were significantly reduced, 9% laparoscopically, 4% with da Vinci. Worth noting is the size of the uterus within the conversions. In the 20 laparoscopic conversions, the average uterus weighed 359 grams, whereas the four da Vinci conversions had average uterine weights of 1387 grams, a pretty significant difference. The authors offered a number of perspectives in their study that supported the following findings. A significant decreased exists in operative time with surgeons and teams experienced with robotic cases. A two-fold decrease in blood loss exists among robotic hysterectomies compared to laparoscopic hysterectomies. After implementation of a robotics program, hospitals may... hospitals stay may be shortened by half a day. They went on to say and I quote this difference may seem trivial, but when we one looks at the overall exploratory rate combined with intra-operative conversion rate in the pre-robotic cohort, it is five fold higher than the robotic cohort. Also the average hospital stay for an abdominal hysterectomy is two to three days with an associated recovery time of six to eight weeks. When one considers the 600,000 hysterectomies performed in United States, up to 63% of these cases are done as total abdominal hysterectomies. The societal impact of virtually eliminating the abdominal approach translates into an annual reduction of 800,000 inpatient hospital stays. Additional benefits would include a decrease in hospital complications This is certainly a long and large... a long term and a large view, but it is a view driven by the results within their own practice, which speaks to why a da Vinci Hysterectomy adoption is growing at such a rapid rate. This concludes my overview and I'll turn the time over to Ben.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing our updated 2008 financial forecast on a GAAP reporting basis including non-cash FAS 123R stock compensation expenses. I will also provide an estimate of our stock compensation charges separately, so you can calculate meaningful comparisons and exclude these non-cash expenses. Based on our second quarter results, we are increasing our previous guidance for revenue and profits for 2008. Starting with procedures, we are seeing higher growth rates across number and different procedures, and we expect our total procedures to grow 57% to 58% this year, up from our pervious forecast of 55% growth. da Vinci Hysterectomy continues to be one of our fastest growing procedures and we continue to expect this procedure to grow at least 150% this year from a base of approximately 13,000 procedures perform last year. da Vinci Prostatectomy has continued to grow strong, but it has been growing less than our previous forecast of 40%. We now expect our dVP procedures to grow between 35% and 39% this year from a base of approximately 55,000 procedures performed last year. At the same time, our newer emerging procedures such as nephrectomies, cystectomies and sacral colpopexies are growing much faster than we previously expected. And therefore, we have increased our overall procedure growth estimate for the year to 57% to 58% from a base of approximately 85,000 total procedures performed in 2007. We are increasing our top line revenue guidance for 2008, we now expect revenues to grow 45% to 47% over 2007, which is up from our previous estimate of 42%. We had strong sequential growth in instrument and accessory revenues during Q2 and we are increasing our estimate for annual growth. Instrument and accessory revenue is expected to grow 57% to 58% this year. This is up from our previous estimate of 55% growth. System revenues in Q2 were also strong as was previously expected, driven primarily by our overall procedure growth. We are now forecasting system revenue to grow 38% to 40% over 2007, which is up from our previous forecast of 33% to 35% growth. We expect this growth to come from an increase in unit shipments. Our system ASP was approximately $1.35 million in Q2, compared to $1.32 million in Q1. As we have mentioned in previous calls, our system ASP fluctuates quarter-to-quarter as a result of geographic and product mix. We continue to expect our average ASP to be approximately $1.33 million for the remainder of the year. We expect service revenues to grow approximately 45% to 46% of our 2007 level. Our previous estimate was 45%. Our average annual service revenue per installed system is approximately $135,000 per year. With regard to gross profit margin, our Q2 margins were sequentially higher than Q1, due in large part to the higher average selling price on systems for the quarter. Gross margins have varied between 69% and 71% over the past few quarters and we expect our total gross margin to be approximately 70% for the reminder of the year. This is up slightly from our previous forecast of 69% to 70%. Moving to operating expense, starting with R&D, we expect total R&D expense to come in between $81 million and $82 million for the year, up approximately 67% from $49 million spent in R&D expense last year. This is higher than our previous forecast by approximately $4 million. The increase stems from additional internal development projects we have planned, purchases of an intellectual property, and co-development arrangements with industry partners. With regard to SG&A expense, we expect total SG&A expense to grow 48% to 49%, which is up from our previous forecast of 47% growth, due to higher variable cost associated with our higher revenue forecast. We expect total operating expense to grow 52% to 53 % and operating income to grow 42% to 44% for the year. Last quarter, we were forecasting operating income to grow at 37%. The improvement in our operating income has been driven by our higher revenue forecast coupled with only a modest increase in SG&A expense. These forecast include the impact of FAS 123R stock compensation expense. We continue to forecast approximately $75 million in stock compensation charges for the year, broken down as follows. $11 million in cost of goods sold, $17 million in R&D expense, and $47 million in SG&A expense. We are lowering our estimate on other income for 2008, due to the significant drop in interest rates. We expect other income for the year to be approximately $26 million. Our previous estimate was $33 million to $35 million. With regard to income tax, as mentioned in the past, we expect to report a GAAP tax rate of approximately 39% for the year. However, we expect our effective cash tax expense to be approximately 20% for 2008. We expect to start reporting the benefits of our international tax strategy in the form of a lower GAAP tax rate in 2009. Regarding shares outstanding, we currently have 38.8 million common shares outstanding. We also have approximately 3.9 million option shares outstanding. Depending upon our average stock price during the year, a portion of 3.9 million option shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation. Calculating our EPS for the year, we expect the share count to be between 40 million and 40.5 million shares. Before closing, I would like to remind you that our third quarter results are typically impacted by seasonally slower growth in revenues due to vacation schedules. This may result in lower sequential revenue growth and likewise lower sequential profits in the third quarter. However, we typically have strong sequential growth in revenue and profits in the fourth quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Eli Kammerman. Sir your line is open.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen & Co.: Thanks very much. My first question is related to one of the procedures that you didn't talk about and that's head and neck surgery. The ones notable training course at the international surgeons meeting this past week, is that on the radar as contributing significantly to procedure increases this year?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: It is not on the radar to be a significant contributor this year. It is as you called out, it is definitely on the radar of our customers and there has been some work that has been done on the procedure but as a remainder, we do not have FDA clearance for that indication. But what we hear from people that have their IDEs in place is that there are some potentially high value adds for the patient value in that application. So, we are definitely watching it. But, it is not going to be a significant contributor this year.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen & Co.: Okay. And my other question is there was the higher than usual number trade-ins this quarter at 6 units. Did you run a special promotion, which encouraged trade-ins or how do you account for this sudden spike in trade-ins?
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There wasn't a special promotion, there are certainly were more this quarter than in previous quarters. Over the past four quarters, it's ranged somewhere between 0 and 2 and so six this quarter was probably a high watermark. We think it's going to vary and it really depends on which customers out there are looking to have a kind of transaction. We think we'll have some in the future, but it's hard to say how many quarter-to-quarter.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, and if you all look at the standard, I mean the standard's been out there since 1990 in Europe and when a hospital decides to buy second system often, they are thinking about also standardizing and so we will... this is part of our long-term plan is that we will have more trade-ins and people will move to the more capable and later versions of the system.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen & Co.: Okay. Then on a related note, what's your average revenue capture per trade-in?
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: If we do sell in that transaction the new system will net a little bit less than we would if we didn't the trade-in. But all-in-all, it's not significantly different and as you can tell from our average selling price for the quarter, it didn't have a significant impact.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen & Co.: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: Tao Levy, your line is open.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Good afternoon. So maybe you could comment a little bit on Mexico now that that manufacturing facility is up and running. What's going to be made there and what type of impact do you expect to occur on the P&L going forward?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I'll answer the demand side, we'll start off making instruments for us and it will be needle drivers and energy instruments and things like that as we go forward. Marshall, I'll let you take any of the financials.
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, from a financial statement impact perspective, as I said earlier, there are some start-up costs associated with brining the facility up. Those costs will more than offset the labor savings and labors really will... where we will achieve some savings, but frankly when you look at the total cost of an instrument, labor is not a large portion of it. So we are not talking about a huge impact on a financial in the future.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And on the R&D that obviously increased a lot and you commented about that in the prepared remarks. But the reality is over the last call it year, year and a half, we have seen R&D go up. We're seen a couple incremental new product disposables come out, which obviously are important. Where is all the extra R&D going into and are there future systems that are being developed which are expected longer term?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So, we take our R&D expense and we put it in really four buckets. And the first bucket is really instruments and accessories and improvements for existing products and those are coming out all the time every quarter. We also put it in imaging systems, optical imaging and other things that will increase our ability to see in the da Vinci system. We work on software improvements and patches for ease of use and those continue and now we work on different architectures, things that are a little bit further out. And then when we look at that we look at that, we also do internal funding as well as work with external partners and there has really been an increase in all four of those areas, as we go forward.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: Imaging the longer term.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And we do research looking further out.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: And just a last question, on the guidance front, Ben you talked about sequentially being down in Q3 because of seasonality and then up in Q4. Historically, that hasn't been the case with the number here [Technical Difficulty] second quarter, do you think seasonality will become more felt and that's kind how we should be thinking in our model?
Benjamin Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: Well, we have seasonality in previous third quarters in that the growth and procedures has been lower. So we would anticipate the same kind of lower procedure growth and it was a pretty strong quarter for system placements in Q2. We are forecasting that Q3 system placements might be relatively flat for Q3 from Q2 and then again higher in Q4. So there is always going to be variability in that. We just want to caution you that there is typically seasonality in Q3.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: But systems you said sequentially flattish. Is that right way to think about it?
Benjamin Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: That's what we are forecasting.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Great quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. David Lewis. Your line is open.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon. Few quick questions. I guess first off, one to you Ben, we felt a different mix of box contribution this quarter, similar to international, relatively similar on VP systems, but obviously an acceleration in new systems on virgin placement. Can we draw any conclusions about these mix shifts quarter-to-quarter or are they going to remain erratic throughout the remainder of year?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I guess my comments is I don't draw lot of conclusions on anything quarter-to-quarter, other than my trend, are we trending properly in terms of procedure growth and that sort of thing. I think that in terms of the mix from Greenfield to second, third, fourth, fifth systems. I think that's just a matter of timing and of course, anybody we sell the first system to over the longer term, we are certainly hopeful they will have such an experience that they will ought to buy second, third systems. So longer term, in the long term, I would expect that the repeat system sales will grow to a larger and larger percentage of total system sales. Now, in the mean time, we've got lots of lot land and lots of places to conquer in terms of Greenfield yet. So that's not an eminent thing, but it is something that in the time horizon that we look at, and I am talking about five to 10 years and longer that it will shift as we get larger and larger installed base.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Okay, that's very helpful. And out of some procedures, I wonder your dVH obviously is growing as well as it was last quarter. As you penetrate more into the gynec [ph] procedure and the complex benign procedures across these different procedures or different physicians that are you learning anything more about the 250,000 complex benign procedures or the 50,000 [ph] and then 200,0000 complex benign. Given the amount that it is growing, you are dealing with these physicians more often, are you still as confident in this 50 and 200 number as you were let's say, six months ago?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: We haven't learned anything that would cause us to be less optimistic than we have been in the past and if anything, I think just probably more evidence of more optimism and that is that the patient value as we have always talked about it on either improving the invasiveness, reducing invasiveness or improving efficacy of the procedure is really proving out in both of those cohorts and from the GY and Onc, I mean again that you are starting to see it now published. You are staring to hear more about it at the different society meetings and you are starting to hear about from authors of manuscripts that are being sent in for publication. There is just more and more of that which is always a good sign, but most importantly, you are hearing it from patients. We are having these experiences in helping to lead to proliferation of more patients. So we are as encouraged as we've ever been, if not more so. I think from the specialty itself, there is reason to be more encouraged on sacral colpopexy for the same reason. You are showing improved at least as efficacious as a gold standard, where invasive open procedure being done minimally and basically and those are on early cases, so all of that is very positive for us.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Alright. And just one last question here. It sounds like new procedure is doing much better than you thought and dVP obviously given it's so yet to give you some success there, but maybe those three procedures nephrectomy, cystectomy and maybe its myomectomy but can you just give us an update of the new procedures, what do you think the total market opportunity is number one? And number two, the ability to penetrate those new procedures, would you say it is faster in the trend line on prostatectomy or slower?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: I would say this, I don't know about the velocity, it's hard for us to the velocity. But I would look at the... let's start with the nephrectomies and partial nephrectomy. So in the U.S., you're looking at roughly 54,000 new renal cancers per year. Now not all of them are line up for this application, but a good portion of it and those are U.S. numbers alone. In the... I would go to sacral colpopexy because the condition effects many more women than the actual sacral colpopexy. In other words, there are other procedures that are less invasive for less severe cases. But we are... we believe in the numbers that we see and what we hear is that that opportunity might be 50 to 60 in this highest 70,000 in the United States. And if you look at myomectomy, again that number is probably around 50,000 to 60,000 in United States. Those are U.S. numbers and those are big numbers. As far as our ability to penetrate it, that will really depend on the patient value and the early indications are very, very positive.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: And Aleks, across all these procedures you are seeing positive length of stay data. And you have timed post in the stay together either in a registry form or a true trial and try to pursue that as a claim in [indiscernible] reimbursement? Thank you.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: We haven't done that and now again we leave a lot of that up to our customers and I think the data that we are expecting to see in the number of people who are doing this procedure will positively be impacted in the future, so we will revisit certain publication strategies from time-to-time, but at this point it's growing pretty rapidly.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Andrew [ph].
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: With William Blair. Thank you for taking the question. Can you talk a little bit about the efforts in the field with the sales organization, because you had added... that was 57 people in Q1 and 76 in Q2. How is the productivity of the new hires in Q1 coming along and then are any of those new hires in Q2 going into the field sales?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Ben, let me just do one quick clarification that there are 57 field people added in Q1. There were 76 total people added to the company in Q2, about 17 of those 76 in Q2 were in the field. So, we do hire a lot of people... tend to hire lot of field people in the first quarter as we basically resize territories, and fill them up. So the second part of your question in terms of productivity of the new hires, there is... you see a ramp up period. With that said, we are seeing, we believe the effects of some of the recent hiring and some of the growth in our procedures this quarter and we're encouraged by that.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Then just coming back to the question on prostatectomy, was there any change in sort of physician behavior update that led to that very small change in guidance and again it a victim of your own success sort of thing, but was there was anything of note there?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: Not really. I think if you look at where you are... draw line between the U.S. and OUS. I mean OUS is growing at a rate obviously significantly higher than the rate that we've given for our guidance. But, if you look at the U.S., you're now in the early... you're in the majority, the late majority and so that by definition is going to be just a little slower goal in picking up those incremental cases. Our push now in the U.S. is certainly expanding throughout the indications of prostate cancer. In other words, trying to convert brachytherapy patients and some of the radiation patients and perhaps even watch for waiting. But, we are still very bullish on dVP as you can tell, it was just a modest change in the mix of our procedure.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Sure. And I... we certainly have seen at the recent robotic conference, there is a lot of interest in nephrectomy generally. Is that something that can be tens of thousands of procedures in a couple of years or is that... do you think it's going to be slower than that, Aleks?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: Well again, I don't think we're going to give any forward-looking projections on that. Could it be in the tens of thousands, well, the indication is again 54,000 new renal cancers in the United States, globally at significantly higher than that. So it is a very large market and we are very encouraged by the patient value and some of their early reports that is taking place. In addition, the macro view on nephron sparing surgery is also very positive and that is used to be you just take out the kidney and leave the health kidney, but now there is plenty of data that suggest that saving the health kidney is going to lead to kidney function for that patient. All of this is happening at the same time, and we're... we think it's very positive.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Alright. Just turning to international markets for a second, you got the approval in China. Is there anything else you need there to be effective on the sales side. Do you need reimbursement approval separately, and what's the next kind one or two international markets that may be you're looking at?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So far China there is not a required, let's say, second approval needed for reimbursement. So now just starting earlier this month, we are able to market the da Vinci S in China. And just as a remainder for some folks who have been asking there, we could not market that product until after we got that clearance. So with the sale cycle in place, you wouldn't expect that you're going to have a sudden boost of sales in China. But we do believe it's an attractive market and we will see sales coming out of China going forward, because of that.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: As far as the other markets, as we've said in the past, we are in the process of trying to secure approval in Japan and there is no new update there.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay, thank you.
Operator: our next question comes from Mr. Rick Wise. Sir, your line is open.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Good afternoon, everybody. It's Rick Wise, Leerink Swann. Your per procedure growth seems exceptionally strong to me against I think the fastest growth quarter of year ago and if our calculation is correct, it suggest something like weekly utilization of 2.9 per week versus 2.7 in the first quarter. Again, is that sum directionally correct and are we likely to see that accelerate from here sort of been stuck in a little bit range for a while?
Benjamin Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: Rick, this is Ben. You are directionally correct. We had certainly growth in utilization from Q1 to Q2 due to the strong procedure growth that we had. I think on average we are somewhere a little bit north of three procedures per week on the installed systems and again sometimes it depends on what you choose as your denominator. We typically choose the ending installed base from the previous quarter. So, you have that right and quarter-to-quarter you're going to definitely have certain fluctuations, but year-over-year is how we take a look at it and year-over-year, we have significant improvement on system utilization.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Somewhat something we can expect to see a gradual increasing going forward likely? The 18 of the 79 systems to current accounts, may be just give us a little color on why that second, third or fourth system was bought. Was it for the new procedures or is it higher volume in da Vinci Prostatectomy and any clear trend there Aleks?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: I think the answer is probably yes in some instance to all of those questions. And I think to what had Lonnie had said earlier, our model is pretty clear and that is to drive da Vinci surgery through a market, through a hospital et cetera to the point where the demand for more than one system becomes pretty obvious. And so at the core of those purchases or most certainly most of those purchases is that the hospital sees that they cannot satisfy the needs of the patients with one system, Rick, or two or three or whatever it is that their denominator was before they brought the additional system. In other words you are running low in capacity and you have supply that's growing the patients. So, those procedures, GYN procedures, specifically if you go back to the GYN approval that we received back in '05 and you sort of map this out over that period, you will see that the addition of those procedures is required, lot of hospitals to get second, third and fourth systems, and they are continuing.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Sounds good. Obviously it was a great quarter, but just help us Aleks if you would on the da Vinci Prostatectomy sort of slightly lower guidance, obviously these are small numbers. But just wanted to understand that how you are looking at, does this suggest in kind of way that you've hit a market penetration ceiling if you will in da Vinci Prostatectomy or that... but clearly offset by all the emerging procedures, how are you thinking about it?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, one, we don't think we have penetration ceiling. Two, as Aleks mentioned, in adoption curve you go through that early majority to the majority and now in surgery in the U.S., we are in the late majority. And so that by nature, there in surgery those going to slow and then the other challenge that we got to pick up the rest of the surgery and then we would like to add other alternative treatments, take market share from those. Now internationally, we are growing much faster because we are low on curve, we are their either at the end of early majority and so it's a faster growth rate, but it's off a smaller base. And so the dynamics of this always will cause until that larger base gets more penetrated, you will have some dynamics in growth. But though we are... this is the nature of adoption and so there is nothing, no surprises here. It's just a matter of moving through adoption curve and doing it in different markets in different times, so.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: The other thing worth mentioning Rick is if you look at it from a sales organization, our sales organization certainly are very incented to get new business. And if you look at just the new procedures that we talked about, we talk about da Vinci Hysterectomy it's a market of 250,000 or more procedures in the United States alone, potentially renal cancers is another 50,000, sacral colpopexy, the number just really grows. So you are really struggling to get full attention in every one of our opportunities, which is a nice high class problem. But they are making trade-offs as well. So, do we think that the remaining procedures are going to come our way, we do. So we are going to go out and we are going to plant some new seeds in other parts of... or are they going to plant seeds in other parts of their territory and we think it's natural.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: There is just lot of just natural demand.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Yes. Two quick last ones, I think you said whatever it was, 77 people added in the quarter whatever the right number is, when you are adding these people last quarter this quarter probably the next couple of quarters, any particular areas that you are focused on expanding, is it sales you still expanding, is it R&D, manufacturing, any perspective there?
Benjamin Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: All of above and it's been consistent and more than half have been in the sales organization and manufacturing organizations.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: It's not that's mean like I think you still emphasized international growth and expansion, it's not... just wondered if you particularly adding there or anything?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: I mean literally are growing everywhere and it that's... I mean the answer really is all above we've got... we've and I've explained this before. First place we allocate resources are into our sales organizations, because that drives revenue and since we found a fixed cost based upon revenue growth that makes... creates a larger umbrella to fund all of the other activities. And so, we have a process that's used to drive revenue growth and then to support the engineering and the development of new products and manufacturing disparity [ph] etcetera, etcetera. So it does it docks down to the whole organization and we've... the support organizations are the ones that we fund at a rate necessary to support and be as efficient as possible.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: Rick,we're going to have take another question.
Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann: Thank you very much.
Unidentified Company Representative: Operator next question please. Amit Hazan. Sir, your line is open.
Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks very much good afternoon guys. Just another follow up on the procedure side this time on dVH. Again may be a little bit a victim of your own success. But we're all used to you guys increasing your guidance pretty regularly and here we are with dVH. Even though you talked about it optimistically, you have not increased your guidance. Again I think about this relative to the systems that you are installing which you're installing at greater pace than many of us are estimating here, at least for the last three or four quarters. And so I am wondering with an increase level of installations based on what you are guiding to, why aren't we seeing that drive hysterectomy beyond what you're guiding to?
Benjamin Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: Amit, this is Ben. So philosophically, we believe that procedures drive everything. Once you're in a territory placing an additional system doesn't necessarily drive, let's say a higher number of procedures. You have a number of procedures out there that are growing and we use the same that these are procedures looking for a system and it's going to find a system that is existing or a new system that's going to be placed. So just because, we placed 85 system versus you modeling 80 doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to ratchet up your to procedures. The dVH is growing incredibly strong. A 150% growth we are certainly not complaining. Is it growing at least as strong as we got it with the beginning of the year? Yes it is and we are very pleased with it.
Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer & Co.: But maybe you could just follow-up; I understand but are you seeing any challenges that you can point to or some of the bigger challenges with dVH, because and just kind of following up on what you said, if you increase your number of systems you should be generating revenue off of those systems that comes off of procedures. So your procedure growth should be faster. Am I not correct?
Benjamin Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: We are not to answer the question. We are not seeing anything that is any hurdle that we haven't expected or I mean just DDH is growing very, very well and as faster, faster than we thought.
Amit Hazan - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay great. And just a second question from me, just on the system side, it does look like the second half of the year is going to grow slower in terms of system sales in the first half. I know you had tough comps in the second half of last year. I'm just wondering because we get the question all the time. If you can answer again the question about changes in hospital spending patterns on capital equipment. If you've seen any of that or if your guidance at all implied any slowdown that you have seen?
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly not. We have actually not seen any impact on let's say credit crunch on the buying patterns of our customers. So we get that question often. We've had it for the past six months and the answer is still the same. We have not seen any impact on the buying patterns. I think you've hit on the right thing there in terms of there are higher comps in the second half of the year in terms of revenue growth and even though we are taking up our overall guidance for the year from 42% top line growth to 45% to 47% growth, we do believe that the growth rate in the second half will not be quite as high as growth rate that we saw in the first half.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: I think we will take one more question, one more and move on.
Operator: Mimi Pham, you may ask your question.
Mimi Pham - JMP Securities: Hi, good afternoon. So far your new centers added so far this year, are you getting broad interest from urology, gynecology, cardiology, and training or is it coming from one dominant specialty. Are there any capacity issues with doctors or anything else that might increase the timeline to get the centers --
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: I would say Mimi that all of the above. I mean we are seeing mostly... we are seeing new systems that are being brought in certainly with the support of urology. Gynecology is weighing in pretty heavily and cardiac is actually... we haven't spent much time on cardiac on this call, because we just don't have enough time. But that is actually helping drive a lot of systems as well. So I would say in general all of those things are happening. As far as training, as we've talked about in the past, we have very developed dVP proctorship network because it's a little more mature. We are always... we have got a nice model. We know how to add proctors and we can do that I think pretty efficiently through our training organization and there is a lot of people that would like to be proctors for us. So we will continue to develop those other areas. GYN, we are certainly getting more proctors, there are more courses, there is more demand... both supply and demand. So I would say, all and all that's all happening.
Mimi Pham - JMP Securities: What's the normal timeline? You haven't seen any changes in the timeline to get new centers up and running. Have you?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: Not that I can point out materially, no.
Mimi Pham - JMP Securities: And then on the international system sales, you got few placements in some new countries. Can you just remind us when you first entered those countries?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: Well, again these are... all three of those were through distributors. They are non-direct sales. And these are the first placements. So when we entered those, I can't really be specific, because I don't know when the first sales call was made in those countries, but those are brand new initial placements.
Mimi Pham - JMP Securities: And then lastly, just have a ballpark number for big the potential for China systems market is?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: We really don't. I mean China is a pretty complex market, as you might imagine, as most developing nations are. But there are a lot of large tier-1 hospitals and there are just a lot of tier-2, a lot of tier-3 hospitals. How big do we think it is, when is robotic surgery going to really penetrate it? we really don't know. Give us a couple of... give us some time to sort of understand that market. We just got clearance this month and we will see.
Mimi Pham - JMP Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That was our last question. As I have said in prior calls, we believe the adoption is driven by a significant shift in patient value, which is a function of improved surgical outcomes and reduced surgical trauma. Dr. Robert Poston and his colleagues at the University of Maryland confirmed the value for patients suffering with coronary artery disease. When he presented the results for 100 consecutive da Vinci off pub [ph] Mini-CABG hyper procedures performed using internal mammary artery grafting plus coronary studies, compared with a mass group of a 100 steronotomy CABG patients using a internal mammary artery grafts and saphenous veins. And he presented that at the American Surgical Association Meeting this last April and it's been accepted for publication in October issue of Annals of Surgery and their findings were as follows: The da Vinci Mini-CABG patients had 99% patency at one year, versus 80% with open surgery. Three to seven fewer days in the hospital and an 85% reduction in MACE, which is Major Cardiac or Cerebrovascular Events one-year post surgery and a 83% reduction intubation time and found no increase in cost and a cost savings with patients with major core morbidities. As we said also in the past that da Vinci patients are the strongest advocates of surgery with the da Vinci Surgical System. Patient Liz McGregor, a patient of audio-vinculus at the University of Michigan. Liz could not conceive, so the doctors put her on fertility drugs. And when she was diagnosed with uterine fibroid tumors, she was told that they were not the cause of her infertility. Liz began to research fibroid tumors on the Internet and read about the Robotic GYN program, a surgery program at the University of Michigan. She had a da Vinci myomectomy to remove the fibroid tumors and made the following comments, I was in and out of the hospital in one day. My recovery was very quick and within a week I felt like myself again. Following surgery I can conceived in three months. I now have two children; Ian, who is just two and Sarah who just turned one. I look at them knowing that they might not be here, if it weren't for the University of Michigan. I guess the question is what greater motivation than stories of patients like these, could anyone ask for. It's certainly a motivation here for us to drive the technology and our capabilities even further. In closing, we remain committed to delivering exceptional value in terms of improved surgical outcomes and reduced surgical trauma for our patients, an exceptional operating performance for our shareholders. We are committed to focusing on the vital few things that will truly make a difference, as we strive to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. That concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking to you again in three months.

Executives: Benjamin Gong - VP of Finance Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and CEO Marshall L. Mohr - Sr. VP and CFO Aleks Cukic - VP, Business Development and Strategic Planning Gary Guthart - President and COO
Analysts: Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank David Louise - Morgan Stanley Rick Wise - Bear Stearns Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia
Operator: Thank you for holding and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Inc. First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be in a listen-only mode until the question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded. If any one has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ben Gong, Vice President of Finance. Sir you may begin.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: Good afternoon and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's first quarter conference call. With me today, we have Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO; Gary Guthart, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer and Aleks Cukic, our Vice President of Business Development and Strategic Planning. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Respective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question and answer session. First, Lonnie will present the quarter's business highlights. Marshall will follow with a review of our first quarter's financial results. Next, Aleks will discuss sales and marketing highlights, and I'll provide an update of our financial forecast for 2008 and finally, we will host a question and answer session. With that I would like to introduce Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you for joining us today. As you can see from our press release, we continue to drive adoption of our robotic-assisted surgery and continue to delver significant top line and bottom line growth. Operating highlights for the first quarter as follows. We sold 74 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 44 during the first quarter of last year. 27 of these systems were sold to existing customers. Our international team had another solid quarter contributing 20 of the 74 systems sold, up from 11 last year. We ended the first quarter with 867 da Vinci systems installed worldwide. That solid quarter-over-quarter procedure growth in all significant specialties led by GYN with strong growth in Urology, particularly in Europe. Procedure adoption continues to be procedure specific, patient driven and the primary growth factor are driver of our business. Total revenue grew to a $188 million, up 65% from last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $62 million, up 54%, total recurring revenue, including service grew to $89 million, up 53% from prior year, comprising 47% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $79 million, 42% of our revenue before non-cash 123R stock option expenses, up 87% from the first quarter of last year. GAAP net income grew to $45 million, 24% of revenue, up 88% from last year. We ended the quarter with $700 million in cash and investments, up $64 million from last quarter and up $315 million from last year. After subtracting $15 million in cash received from exercise of stock options and adding back $30 million, invested in fixed assets and working capital during the quarter, our gross operating cash flow in the first quarter amounted to 167% of our reported GAAP net income. This is reflection of the significant non-cash stock option, and statutory tax expenses. Reflecting our GAAP net income and is reason that we continue to believe that operating profit before non-cash 123R stock option expense remains the best measure of our true financial performance. We launched several new instrument and accessory products. We received update clearance, with the da Vinci driven EndoWrist cardiac stabilizer and removal of the beating heart warning [ph] language and the FDA approved instructions were used, for both the da Vinci and da Vinci Systems. We grew our Intuitive team by 95 members to 859, 57 of those were in field sales and service. With that I'll this time over to Marshall our Chief Financial Officer.
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Lonnie. Total first quarter revenue of $188.2 million increased 65%, compared with $114.2 million for the first quarter 2007 and decreased 1%, compared with $189.4 million for fourth quarter of 2007. First quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue increased $61.9 million, up 54%, compared with $40.3 million, last year and up 10% compared with $56.1 million last quarter. The growth rate in instruments and accessories is comparable to in a direct result of our procedure growth rates. The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we earn per procedure has remained relatively unchanged between $1,500 and $2,000 per procedure for established da Vinci accounts. Our average revenue per procedure including initial stocking orders has been gradually decreasing as the ratio of new systems to our install base declined and it is between $2,000 and $2,300 per procedure. Systems revenue of $99.1 million increased 76%, compared with $56.1 million last year, and decreased 9%, compared with $108.6 million last quarter. The increase in Systems revenue, compared with first quarter 2007, reflects increased unit sales, as well as an increase in the average revenue per system. The decrease in the Systems revenue, compared with the fourth quarter of 2007 reflects seasonality overseas, as well as a decrease in the average revenue per system. First quarter da Vinci Surgical System revenue reflects the sale of 74 systems, compared 44 systems during first quarter of last year and 78 systems sold in the fourth quarter. Two of the systems sales in the quarter involved trade-institution, where two customers upgraded one of their existing da Vinci Standard Systems, while purchasing two da Vinci S Systems with HD. 60 of these systems sold during the quarter were latest S model, incorporating high definition vision capabilities. 10 were four-arm S models incorporating standard vision capabilities, three were three-arm S models and one was standard system. Our first quarter average revenue per system, including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades was approximately $1.32 million, which is 60,000 thousand less than the average revenue per system in the fourth quarter of 2007. The lower average revenue per system, primarily reflects a higher proportion of our fourth quarter sales, being direct sales to European customers which are denominated in euros and in otherwise favorable geographic mix in the fourth quarter. Upgrades during the fourth quarter, including fourth arms and HD accounted for $1.6 million of the current quarter systems revenue, compared with $1 million, last quarter. Service revenue increased to $27.2 million, up 53% compared with $17.8 million last year and up 10%, compared with $24.7 million last quarter. The growth and service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system install base, as well as higher annual contract prices associated with da Vinci S and HD models. Total first quarter recurring revenue comprise of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to $89.1 million, up 53% compared with the first quarter of 2007 and up 10%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2007. Recurring revenue represented 47% of total first quarter revenue, compared with 43% in the fourth quarter. Revenue outside the United States represented 23% of total first quarter revenue, compared to 26% in the fourth quarter, decrease reflects business seasonality as we placed 20 systems in the first quarter, compared with 26 systems in the fourth quarter. Our first quarter 2008 gross margin of 69% decreased compared with 71.4% realized in the fourth quarter. The decrease in gross margin reflects lower average system ASPs and higher operating cost over similar revenue levels. The increase in operating costs includes expansion of manufacturing operations in Sunnyvale, as well as initial start-up cost for Mexico. Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2008 were $64.9 million, compared with $61.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The sequential operating expense increase of $3.1 million reflects increased non-cash 123R stock compensation expense costs of $3.8 million and costs associated with increased headcount, partially offset by lower cost associated with R&D activities that are expected to occur in the second quarter. We added 95 employees during the first quarter ending the period with 859 regular employees. The majority of the additions were to our worldwide sales and support and manufacturing organizations. First quarter 2008 operating income was $64.9 million or 34.5% sales, compared with $73.4 million or 38.7% of sales for the fourth quarter 2007. I should point out that 123R stock compensation expense included in the operating income was $14.6 million for the first quarter, compared with $10.1 million in the fourth quarter. The increase of $4.5 million reflects the impact to our annual stock grant made on February 15th coupled with the increase in our stock price. Our first quarter 2008 other income was $8.5 million, which is approximately the same as we realized in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our effective tax rate for first quarter was 39%, which is consistent with our rate for 2007. We continue to utilized carry forward tax benefits and employees stock related tax benefits in 2008 and expect that our cash outlaid for income taxes will be less than 25% of pre-tax income for 2008. Our net income of $44.8 million, or $1.12 per share increased to 88%, compared with $23.8 million or $0.62 per share for the first quarter of 2007 and decreased 9%, compared with $49.2 million or $1.24 per share for the fourth quarter of 2007. Now turning our attention to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter of 2008 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $700 million, up $64 million from December 31st 2007. $15 million of the cash generated in the quarter was associated with stock purchase activities. The remaining cash generated is primarily related to operating activities. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $135.7 million at March 31st from $130.4 million at December 31st. The change in receivables reflects the timing of customer purchases and payments relative to our quarter cut off. Our net inventory increased to $38.8 million at March 31st from $32.4 million at December 31st. Our inventory returns at March 31st of 5.7 times per year were lower than the 6.5 turns at the end of the previous quarter, as we build in inventory for future growth. And with that I would like turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: Thank you Marshall. During the first quarter, we shift 74 da Vinci Systems, which included two trade-ins. Geographically, 54 systems were sold in the United States, 12 in Europe and eight in rest of world markets. 73 of the 74 systems shipments were da Vinci S Systems and one was a Standard da Vinci system. Of the 73 S systems sold, 60 were high definition or HD systems. The net 72 systems sold during the quarter brings to 867, the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide, 647 in the U.S, 148 in Europe and 72 in rest of world markets. 27 of the 74 systems sold during the quarter represented VP systems sales to existing customers, which brings to 94, the number of hospitals which owned more than one da Vinci system. Within these 94 Hospitals, 69 owned two, 17 owned three, seven owned four and one owns five. I think it's relevant to know that we often experience da Vinci S is being purchased at a facility that already owns a standard system, or perhaps several standard systems, only the transfer the standard system to our sister facility that does not own one. We've excluded these transfer units from the multiple system calculation that I just referenced. Outside the U.S, we had a strong quarter which included three more da Vinci systems into Korea, three into the Netherlands, three into Italy and our first three into Brazil. Basically, we had another good quarter, a quarter in which experienced solid sequential procedure growth within all four of our targeted surgical specialties. Our gynecologic procedure business paced by da Vinci Hysterectomy and da Vinci Sacral Colpopexy registered the largest sequential percentage growth for the quarter, where as urology registered the largest absolute growth. Worth noting is the tremendous growth, we experienced within our Kidney and Bladder Cancer businesses, specifically the da Vinci Nephrectomy and Partial Nephrectomy and da vinci Cystectomy. Within our Cardiac business, da Vinci Mitral Valve Repair also showed strong sequential growth. During Q1, we had 117 da Vinci related clinical papers published within the peer view Journals across multiple surgical specialties. We also launched four new products and received FDA 510(k) clearance for a fifth, the fourth arm upgrade for the three-arm da Vinci S System, the 8.5 millimeter stereo endoscope, balloon camera cannula and the da Vinci [indiscernible] were launched during the quarter. We also received 510(k) clearance for da Vinci Control Cardiac stabilizer product and had a beating heart warning language removed from the instructions for use for both da Vinci and da Vinci S Systems. Although, these products will assist our customers in optimizing targeted procedures. None of them is expected to immediately impact our top or bottom lines. We participated in clinical conferences within urology, gynecology, general surgery, and cardiothoracic surgery during the quarter. However, I'll limit my review to only a few beginning with the Society of Gynecologic Oncology or SGO. Is use SGO took place in Tampa, Florida and was attended by over a 1,000 GYN oncologists. As we've mentioned in the past, SGO members are key target customers for us. Since they are the group that perform hysterectomies for both malignancies and complex benign conditions. We have now presented da Vinci at three SGO conferences and this year's event clearly confirmed da Vinci's clinical role within the treatment path for complex Hysterectomy. This year, the SGO offered a postgraduate course and robotic and Radical Hysterectomy for cervical cancer featured several oral presentations and robotic Hysterectomy for both cervical and endometrial cancers, and highlighted several clinical posters comparing da Vinci Hysterectomy to both open and Laparoscopic techniques. During the SGO postgraduate course, Dr. John Boggess from the University of North Carolina shared his outcomes data for da Vinci Radical Hysterectomy, in which he compared 50 Radical dVH's [ph] for cervical cancer to 50 radical hysterectomies performed through traditional open incisions. His comparisons were pretty telling, beginning with over time, which was 210 minutes for its dVH's, compared to 247 minutes for his open hysterectomies. Blood loss for his dVH's was 95 milliliters and 416 milliliters for his open hysterectomies. dVH lymph nodes [ph] of 32... excuse me, 33.8, compared to 23.3 for his opens and hospitalization of one day for his dVH's versus 3.2 days for his opens, all while reducing complications by 50%. Dr. Lynn Kowalski, a surgeon from Nevada Surgery & Cancer Care in Las Vegas, presented a simple comparison and her radical hysterectomies with the addition of transfusion rates and published her results in excepted clinical poster. And Dr. Kowalski's series of 31 patients, she reported loss to be 182 milliliters with zero transfusions within a dVH co-work [ph], as compared to 415 and three transfusions for her open procedures. dVH lymph node of 20.7, verses 16 for open and dVH hospitalizations of 1.4 days, versus 6.1 days for her open radical hysterectomies. All in all, we are pleased with the increase in the da Vinci Surgery awareness and clinical outcomes data presented at this year's SGO conference. At the world robotic urology symposium, which took place in Orlando the three day agenda was devoted exclusively to da Vinci and the presentations were non-stop. The program was attended by over 600 urology professions. In addition to the oral presentations, panel discussions and poster reviews with channelized surgery broadcasts featuring dVP, da Vinci Nephrectomy and Partial Nephrectomy, da Vinci Cystectomy and thyroplasty [ph]. I selected one abstract which I believe capsulates da Vinci's value to not only the urologists, but the surgeons multiple across the multiple specialties. The team at University of California, Irvine, led by Dr. Lesley Dean [ph], presented their initial series on da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy comparing it to Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy performed by expert Laparoscopic surgeons within their facility. Similar to Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy, Laparoscopic Partial/Wedge Nephrectomy is a technically challenging procedure that is performed by a limited number of expert Laparoscopic surgeons. This analysis compared the outcomes of an initial experience with robotic Partial/Wedge Nephrectomy performed by an experienced open surgeon to that our standard Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy being performed by two experienced Laparoscopic surgeons. Their initial clinical results were as follows: the mean tumor size was 3.1 centimeters for the da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy patients and 2.3 centimeters for their Laparoscopic patients. Mean total procedure time was reduced by an hour using da Vinci to 228 minutes versus 289 minutes during their Laparoscopic procedures. Estimated blood loss was 115 milliliters with da Vinci versus 198 millimeters during laparoscopy. The mean warm ischemia time was 32.1 minutes in the da Vinci group and 35.3 minutes in the Laparoscopic group. The authors concluded, and I quote, introducing a robotic interface for Laparoscopic Partial/Wedge resection allows a fellowship trained urologic oncologist with limited reconstructive Laparoscopic experience to achieve comparable results for Laparoscopic Partial/Wedge resection performed by experienced Laparoscopic surgeons. In this regard the learning curve appears truncated, similar to that with robotic assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy. It's important to mention that the field of nephron-sparing surgery is growing rapidly worldwide and for good reason. In the near past urologists have come to agree that preserving healthy kidney tissue contributes to improved kidney function for patients with renal tumors. The partial nephrectomies are difficult to perform. So the standard operation for patients with renal tumors has been the removal of the entire kidney. Today the urology profession is rapidly moving towards sparing as much healthy tissue as possible. And da Vinci's role within these procedures is being recognized early. Some of the leading academic centers around the world have begun to make da Vinci standard within these procedures. And later this quarter the First Annual Worldwide Robotic Renal Symposium will be hosted by Washington University in St. Louis and chaired by one of the leaders in the field Dr. Sam Bhayani. And it will include an international faculty of prominent renal surgeons. The European Association of Urology conference was held in Milan and attended by nearly 12,000 urologists. This year's program included multiple DDP presentations, abstracts, posters and live surgery, as well as presentations in da Vinci Nephrectomy, Partial Nephrectomy and Cystectomy. One of the most interesting initial series on Radical Cystectomy was given by the group out of [ph] guys in St. Thomas Hospital in London. Lead by Dr. Prakash S. [ph] Gupta. The study compared their first ten da Vinci radical cystectomies to ten Laparoscopic and ten open radical cystectomies at various time intervals. Their first comparison performed intra... measured interoperatively reported that patients undergoing open radicals experienced 325 minute procedures with 1,300 milliliters of blood loss and 60% complication rates. Their Laparoscopic procedures averaged 345 minutes with 350 milliliters of blood loss and 50% complication rates. Whereas their da Vinci Cystectomy patients underwent 365 minute procedure with only 150 milliliters of blood loss with complication rates of only 20%. As these procedures are performed to eradicate cancer, the long-term disease free rates are primary concern. Their experiences for lap and robotic were not as seasoned as their experiences with open surgery. So they measured each patient at different intervals. They stated that 60% of the open radical patients were disease-free at five years. About 60% of the lap patients were disease-free at four years. Whereas da Vinci patients were 100% disease free at three years. It's too early to declare a complete victory, but the significant reduction in blood loss and complication rates along with a three-year disease-free rates are very encouraging. In addition to some of the exciting presentations in Nephrectomy, Partial Nephrectomy, and Radical Cystectomy at this year's EAU were dozens of presentations and posters for da Vinci Prostatectomy. It's becoming pretty clear that dVP is rapidly expanding around the globe. In fact in the feature presentation to the joint session of the EAU and the Chinese Urology Association entitled is robotic Radical Prostatectomy the future? Dr. Richard Gaston of the Clinique St Augustin in Bordeaux, France, the chairperson and the surgeon often credited with performing the first Laparoscopic Prostatectomy in Europe, concluded, and I quote. The overall data indicates that robotic Prostatectomy is the future, and the future is now. This concludes my overview, and I'll now turn the time over to Benj.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing our updated 2008 financial forecast on a GAAP reporting basis including non-cash FAS 123R stock compensation expenses and on a pro forma basis which excludes the stock compensation expenses. Based on our first quarter results we are increasing our previous guidance for revenue and pro forma profits for 2008. On a GAAP reporting basis we are not increasing our forecasts for profits because stock compensation expenses are greater due largely to our higher stock price. I will provide details of our stock compensation expense later in the call. Now starting with procedures, we continue to expect dVP and dVH adoption to drive the growth in our 2008 recurring revenues. For 2008 we continue to expect dVP procedures to grow approximately 40% from a base of about 55,000 procedures performed in 2007. And we expect dVH procedures to grow approximately 150% from a base of about 13,000 procedures performed in 2007. As regard to revenue, we expect our total 2008 to grow approximately 42% over 2007, which is up from our previous estimate of 40%. Instrument and accessory revenue which is specifically driven by procedures performed is on track to grow 55% this year. During Q1 procedures grew in line with our previous estimates and therefore we are maintaining our forecast for 55% growth in instrument and accessory revenues for the year. System revenues were modestly stronger than we expected in Q1 and we are increasing our forecast for the year. We are forecasting system revenue to grow 33% to 35% over 2007, which is up from our previous forecast of 30% growth. We expect this growth to come from an increase in unit shipments. Our system ASP was $1.32 million in Q1 which is similar to our average for all of 2007. As we mentioned in our last call we expect our average system ASP for the year to be about the same. However, our system ASP may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of geographic and product mix. We expect service revenues to grow approximately 45% above 2007 levels which is slightly higher than our previous estimate of 44%. Our average annual service revenue per installed system is approximately $135,000 per year. With regard to gross profit margin our Q1 results were inline with our expectations and we're continuing to forecast gross margins to be between 69% and 70% for the year. Moving to operating expense and operating income, I will start with our forecast on a pro forma basis excluding the impact of non-cash stock compensation expense. Excluding stock compensation charges we expect R&D expense to grow approximately 40% over last year. SG&A expense to grow approximately 37%. And total operating expense to grow approximately 40%. We expect pro forma operating income to grow approximately 47% for the year. Last quarter we were forecasting pro forma operating income to grow 43%. Improvement in our pro forma operating income is being driven by our higher revenue forecast coupled with only a modest increase in pro forma SG&A expense. Now on a GAAP basis, the largest change to our forecast related to our estimate of non-cash stock compensation expense. During our last earnings call we have forecasted these charges based on a stock price of $250 which was approximately where the stock was trading at the time. As you know our stock price depreciated significantly over the past three months and as a result we expect the charges to income for stock compensation expense to be significantly higher. Based on the current stock price we are now estimating a total of $75 million in stock compensation charges for the year which is up from our previous forecast of 60 million. Our new estimate of 75 million is distributed as follows: 12 million in cost of good sold which compares with 10 million previously forecast. 17 million in R&D which compares with 13 million previously forecast. And 47 million in SG&A which compares with 37 million previously forecast. This would represent an over 100% increase in the stock compensation expense for the year compared with the 36 million total stock compensation expense recorded in 2007. Therefore on a GAAP basis our total operating expenses are expected to be higher than we previously forecast. In the R&D expense category, our spending in Q1 was lower than expected due to timing of some planned expenditures. We expect to incur those expenses during the second quarter. For the year we expect R&D expense to grow approximately 59%, this is up from our previous forecast of 52% growth due to the increase in stock compensation expense. In the SG&A expense category, we made progress expanding our field sales and service organization by adding 57 people, bringing our total field organization to approximately 320 people. We are continuing to hire field personnel at a rapid pace. For the year we expect our SG&A expenses to grow approximately 47%. This is up from our previous forecast of 40% growth, primarily due to the increase in stock compensation expense and to a smaller extent due to the growth in our revenue forecast. We expect total operating expense, including FAS 123R stock compensation expense, to grow approximately 15% for the year. We expect operating income to grow approximately 37% for the year. For the second quarter 2008 we expect our stock compensation expense to grow approximately $5 million from Q1. Other income expense for 2008 is expected to come in between $33 million and $35 million for the year. This is down from our previous estimates of $36 million to $40 million due to lower interest rates on our cash investments. With regard to income tax, as mentioned in the past, we expect to report a GAAP tax rate of approximately 39% for the year. However, we expect our effective cash-tax expense to be less than 25% for 2008. We expect to start reporting the benefits of our international tax strategy in the form of a lower GAAP tax rate in 2009. Regarding shares outstanding, we currently have 38.7 million common shares outstanding. We also have approximately 3.9 million option shares outstanding. Depending upon our average stock price during the year, a portion of the 3.9 million option shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation. Calculating EPS, in 2008, we expect the share count to be approximately 40.2 million shares in Q2 and growing to approximately 40.8 million shares by the end of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks; we will now open the call to your question. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. At this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Eli Kammerman with Cowen. Sir your line is open.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: Yes, thank you. Couple of questions here, first question I had is with the very small sequential decline in systems that you had for the quarter. What do you think this says for the pattern of seasonality that you expect to see this year? Are you expecting to see relatively level system sales through the year or do you think we will see the same kind of thing as we saw in 07 where the fourth quarter was significantly higher than the first?
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: This is Ben. Eli I think the seasonality is going to be similar as far as we know. It was sequentially down in Q1 this year as it has been in previous years. We will expect Q4 to be our highest quarter, but that said we think the total number is going to increase year-over-year by between 33% and 35%.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: Okay, and my next question is can you make some comment about the expected launch date for the new visualization technology that's going to integrate anatomical radiology images into the viewer.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: I'm not sure what you're referencing there.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: Okay, I thought I read that you are developing some type of integration function where you can put volumetric imagery into the view screen, so that a physician can see, for instance, MRI images at the same time that they are performing the surgery.
Unidentified Company Representative: That capability exists today in the S System... the S System part of the... the system allows you to bring other information sources into a picture within a picture on the screen, and so we... that is not... that capability was launched when we launched the S; the da Vinci S.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: Do you plan to upgrade that functionality to allow for image guided surgery where certain parts of the anatomy will be structured as off limits to dissection for safety purposes.
Unidentified Company Representative: No fly zone.
Gary Guthart - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, so this is Gary, we have some research programs ongoing internally and with external partners exploring how those types of things can be done. I guess I would not characterize them as product development at this time. So there are some significant hurdles in base technology that will have to be overcome to make that kind of no fly zone repeatable in soft tissue areas as we go.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: And our next comes from Tao Levy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Good afternoon.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi, Tao.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: So, I was just wondering, just following on Eli's comment. This is the first time I think in the last few years that sequentially in the U.S. you had more systems placed in Q1 then in Q4. Does that say anything about the capital spending environment and any issues there? Obviously we get that question all the time and you read about in the papers everyday.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: Tao, this is Ben. It was slightly higher in Q1 versus Q4, but I think we feel that is within the realm of the normal, let's say fluctuation you might have quarter-to-quarter. System sales are strong, that's true, and that's why we took up our guidance for the year, but I think our forecast captures what we are currently seeing.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: And anything on capital equipment spend that you are hearing from your sales reps?
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: No, we are not hearing anything there. I know over the quarter we've had various questions as to whether or not there has been impact due to credit issues, and as far as we can tell we haven't had any impact to our system sales.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Okay, and I think during the prepared remarks someone commented that urology in Europe was strong. I was just wondering if you could further elaborate on that point. Is that why you are seeing... you feel like in at least in the Netherlands every quarter they're buying three or four systems, is that... what they are using it primarily for, for example there?
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: Well, I think it's safe to say that da Vinci Prostatectomy is being adopted outside of the United States and at different rates in different countries. Urology specifically including... excuse me Nephrectomy, Cystectomy and the like were strong both U.S. and o-U.S., but particularly strong in the o-U.S. market. So, I think as we've always said that outside of the United States, Europe and rest of world markets tends to trial the United States. And so the growth that we have seen over the last several years in da Vinci Prostatectomy within the U.S. is now starting to really play out in Middle East, Asia, and so on.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from David Louise with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
David Louise - Morgan Stanley: Hello, good afternoon Thanks for taking the question. I guess open-ended question here just on new customer growth in the U.S. marketplace. I think this is the second quarter in a row where we've seen it decline on a box basis. Is there any chance that new [indiscernible] customers in the U.S. would reaccelerate in 2008. And sort of the second part of that question would be. Is the focus in the U.S. market specifically some comments on ads [ph] is it really shifting from driving aggressive utilization and less about version customer or new customer placement.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: David I think there is a... and we've commented at different times over the let's say the last seven or eight quarters. There have been some quarters where the percentage of repeat purchases was high followed by quarters where it was low. I don't know that we can say that it's going to follow this trend or that trend and quite honestly we are pleased to see recurring customers coming back and buying more systems. Now one of the things that is, is something that perhaps you don't have great disability into it are, for example, customer like St. Joes in Atlanta. This quarter they brought another system, that was a repeat customer, in fact they would have bought their fifth system, but they moved one of their earlier systems to a customer, that did... a sister hospital that did not have a da Vinci. So there is a lot of things that are going on, and we think all positive. So, is it possible that in some quarters it will reaccelerate, yeah it is possible.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But, I think, this is Lonnie. I think the confirmation of the value-add of the system is really reflected in repeat purchases. And those that have bought and had found success and then buy a second system that's a confirmation of their satisfaction with their purchase and willingness to do it again. Long-term, in terms of adoption of the technology that's a good sign, that's a positive. The worst case for us is everybody buys one and they don't buy another one, because they weren't satisfied with their investment. And that is not the case. We are seeing people who buy these systems and develop excellent programs, come back and buy a second, third or fourth system, as Aleks has pointed out. And we expect that to continue. The volatility, the change in that dynamic from quarter-to-quarter... I think Aleks is right on the money.
David Louise - Morgan Stanley: Okay, that's very helpful. It's hard to be naked about box placements, it is just interesting that in two more quarters it looks like Europe could even eclipse new placement growth or new box growth in the U.S., which obviously isn't a bad thing, but I appreciate the color. The second thing is just on surgical volumes, I may have missed in the commentary, it was flying fast and furious. But there was little mention of Myomectomy or Sacral Colpopexy, but there was some mention obviously of Nephrectomy, Cystectomy as well as the Mitral Valve is that simply just giving us a flavor for new procedures that are out there or did you see trends in Myomectomy and Sacral Colpopexy that flat than they [ph] did in the first quarter?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Both have grown.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: Yeah, and actually I did mention Sacral Colpopexy with Hysterectomy. So those were the two leaders within gynecology which the category being the fastest growing as a percentage were lead by Hysterectomy and Sacral Colpopexy. And I think the added color on some of the other procedures were really in line with the color that those procedures are getting at the various conferences that we've attended during the quarter and they're coming on pretty strongly. So I think it was a way to call out some endpoints that people are looking at and really let you know that these things are arriving within the clinical community and at the clinical conferences.
David Louise - Morgan Stanley: Great, and I'll jump back in queue, but it was [ph] last question, could you provide us an update on any discussions you've had or any progress with Japan or to a lesser extent China?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, on the Japan front we continue to make progress with the government. We are going back and forth on the form of our submission it's not, we're not in the window where we're predicting the end date, but I'm happy with our progress to-date? I [indiscernible]... and I'll turn that back over to Lonnie.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: China, there really is no new... really nothing new to mention there with regard to China. And for the quarter
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We didn't have any placements this past quarter in China.
David Louise - Morgan Stanley: Great. Well, thank you very much.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks David.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rick Wise with Bear Stearns. Your line is open.
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: Good afternoon everybody.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi Rick.
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: Gross margins. Again you talked about the pressure or drag on gross margins from... and the Sunnyvale expansion and the Mexico startup. Can you just remind us, either... I'd be happy to hear you quantify the amount of that drag and just remind us again when that goes away?
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: Yeah, Rick, this is Ben. Actually the biggest impact on gross margins was probably the product and geographic mix which made the ASPs lower by $60,000 quarter-over-quarter on the system sales. So there were some modest things. Revenue was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, but we continue to build our team, and so you have a higher fixed cost there over... about similar number of revenues. And but the point here is not that there is a big drag there. And the 69% to 70% forecast that we have for the rest of the year is right in line with where we thought we hit the Q1.
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: Yeah, well, as always, Ben, you anticipate where I am going. I mean it came out slightly higher revenue, roughly, revenue volumes... so you are saying most of that sequential shift was that geographic mix element.
Benjamin Gong - Vice President of Finance: Absolutely the 71% that you saw in Q4, if anything, was standing out a little bit among all the quarters around it. And that was a quarter where we had a pretty high mix of direct sales into Europe and a low mix of... lower mix in distribution sales.
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: And I apologize for asking this question again, it was already well asked by Tao and well answered. But let me ask it somewhat differently. The anxiety over cap spending and hospital credit. I don't know if it's a question for Lonnie or Marshall, but just... when you look at the environment or your conversations with hospitals or the decision makers. Is there anything in the external environment that makes you External environment that mix you incrementally more concerned that you look out over the next 12 months in you know in the U.S. versus where you might itself six months ago just in that external environment that makes you incrementally more concerned as you look out over the next 12 months in the U.S. versus what you might have felt six months ago just in that external environment.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: On the external side... I'll try to answer it. I don't get any. I've still not get any feedback from the sales organization that there is pressuring out, some hospitals are in better shape than others. And... but there is always the decision within a hospital, how do they prioritize their capital investment. And I think we came up typically fairly high on that priority list. As you know in the financial markets whenever you keep stipulating for the next shoot or drop and you are familiar with it more than probably anyone, we don't... but we don't hear anything that causes us any significant concern. I've got lots of concerns about other things we have to be running or working very hard, but not... that one has not yet look like it's real issues. So, I don't have any different news than we had. No change from last quarter, I guess, is the simple way to state it.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: I would just add one thing Rick, is... to underscore Lonnie's point on the priorities that hospitals, the way they will prioritize. If you compare the purchase of a da Vinci to some other piece of technology, let's say in the 7 figure range. Number one, our system does not require any sort of a room fit. So, it doesn't have to be staged with new operating rooms or a series of new operating rooms, which tend to be very, very expense. Our systems are installed by one person, in a morning. So they are delivered uncrated and installed. So, as compared to some of the other things that are out there that require room, refits and bricks and mortar, that may end up being part of major OR refits that may be supported by a bond or some form of debt vehicles. So, we are not really in the same category with a lot of those decisions. So thus far we haven't seen it, but we are certainly not going to predict the velocity of the broader credit markets.
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: Okay, just one last quick one. Given the strength in complex hysterectomies and nephrectomies, partial nephrectomies. Can you just remind us the opportunity. And given the up-tick, is this where is... as you know, I am always looking for upside... is this where upside could come in the next 6, 12, 18 months. We are hearing a lot of great things about use in these areas as well. Thanks.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning: You know I would just caution on a timeline for the following reason. What we have learned thus far, let's start with da Vinci Prostatectomy. It was cleared by the U.S. FDA in 2001. And it took pretty significant commitment for the first two years to really get that to what at the time was a material number. And so it's not going to be... I doubt we stumble across a procedure that is like throwing a light switch, that everybody just comes running to it immediately. It's going to take a lot of work. So when you define upside... not having benefit of what you are calling upside... we are very bullish on it, we will grow it over the next 18- to 24 months. But whether it meets the quote upside definition, I am just not sure what that is, but we are very bullish on it.
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Rick.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vincent Ritchie with Wachovia. Your line is open.
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is going to be on option rate securities [Audio Gap]...
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: ... that we did evaluate those, and given the liquidity issue to exists today we did record a $4.4 million reserve that only runs through the balance sheet, because we believe this is a temporary impairment, if you will.
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Okay great. And then switching over to more of a therapeutic view. Can you kind of give us a perspective on your maybe compare and contrast for us ASCO with SGO?
Unidentified Company Representative: I'm sorry could you repeat that question.
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Just kind of qualitatively characteristics about ASCO with SGO, in terms of, kind of a concentrated group of surgeons having a very focused kind of perspective on the different factors?
Unidentified Company Representative: I'm still not following you
Unidentified Company Representative: What's ASCO.
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: The colorectal American side ?
Unidentified Company Representative: Okay, the compare and contrast for this, alright.
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Yeah.
Unidentified Company Representative: Well, I would say that there are... I mean in raw numbers they are very, very similar. I believe there are 1,100 registered GYN oncologists in the United States and there are roughly 1,500 board certified colorectal surgeon. And they both are subspecialties within a very large group as SGO is to gynecology, colorectal is to general surgery. So I think there is definitely some easy things to compare and contrast there. I would say that in terms of the development within or I should say the early adoption thus far within gynecology as compare to colorectal surgery. It hasn't quite been on that level and nor at this stage are we saying that it is going to be. But there are a lot of things within that society and within that disease state that we believe set up well with da Vinci. It just hasn't materialized yet, but it's a procedure we're focusing on and time will tell.
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Okay, great. And then my last question is on notes. You know this is a topic of conversation among surgeons. About a year ago you guys had expressed some modest but conservative interest there and then one of the sessions of SGO also discussed possibly some robotic applications. Do you think this is an area of interest or what's your guys' perspective on it because this is a very controversial topic.
Gary Guthart - President and Chief Operating Officer: This is Gary. You know as we look out at it, we look at both single port surgery and notes. And we're exploring those fields. I think they are a little bit different and single port maybe a little sooner than notes. I think it will be a little while for real patient value to be understood in those two. And I guess our strongest statement is that if there is patient value to be had there, we think robotics will play a significant role in pursuing that value. So we're in the exploration phase, we take it seriously, and we will see where it takes us.
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Unidentified Company Representative: We have time for two more questions.
Operator: And our next question comes from Amit Hazan with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi this is Michael Chu [ph] calling in for Amit. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is related to, both, how you said guidance and visibility on hospital spending trends? Can you just remind us of how long it typically takes from initially lead to become a system sale. And we know it's a general question but any color you can give us would be helpful.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah this has been... for the sale cycle on systems. We said in the past that the full cycles averages maybe three to six months in the United States, and that's probably still the case. We will occasionally get some that sell pretty quickly in less than three months. So, we also have some that will take longer than six, but on average it's still looking the same. Internationally, is definitely longer, you can have some territories that are currently over a year, but there is actually some signs in Europe with some of our direct sales that that's definitely shorter. So you know maybe somewhere closer to six months in some of those territories. And we take that all into account when we give our forecast.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you and the next question is related to the macroeconomic issues. Wanted to know, currently what is the percentage of U.S. system sales are financed?
Unidentified Company Representative: Roughly speaking about 15% of our system sales are financed.
Unidentified Analyst: And how about in Europe or rest of the world.
Unidentified Company Representative: There is actually maybe a similar percentage in Europe that are financed. The rest of the world ones, they vary quite a bit actually. So, it can be very different let's say in Brazil as you might see, in say Korea.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Unidentified Analyst: My last question is, what is the average utilization on the system, before you are seeing a second and third system purchase from the same customer and how should we think about the second and third system purchases as they relate to hospital spending if there is really a contraction in terms of capital expenditures?
Unidentified Company Representative: Couple of things there. I don't know that there is a perfect algorithm for when a second or third of fourth system is purchased. What we have seen that I think is pretty unanimous is that the larger the... of specialties in other words, if urology and gynecology and cardiac surgery and general surgery are all engaged in robotic surgery that the capacity of that system is reached much sooner and the requirement for a second system happens much sooner than let's say a system that has a really strong urology focus and they are the dominant specialty. So what we have seen in the past is that in multiple specialty purchases we tend to sometime see those around 250 to 300 procedures per year when they are trending at that rate. And you'll probably see, again in some situations where it's actually higher than that where they aren't as many specialties. It's not a perfect algorithm and depending on the commitment that the hospital is making to its overall MIS program which is starting to become very apparent, they will often get systems dedicated to each specialty to avoid that lockjam.
Unidentified Analyst: And just one quick follow-up as well to you, sales for the quarter. Want to know what was the overall FX impact?
Unidentified Company Representative: FX impact? On a year-over-year basis we had $1.1 million of FX gain greater than last year. And what we haven't yet done is how much impact was there on the overall business, 23% of our sales were international for the quarter. But you are right there was only six systems that were sold directly into Europe this past quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, alright, thank you very much.
Unidentified Company Representative: One more question.
Operator: And our last question come from Steve Algovi [ph] with ThinkEquity. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to dive in a little deeper on the SG&A spend, specifically the 57 new hires. If you could maybe give us some color on where that is Europe versus U.S? And then as a follow-up to that talking about concentration of procedures, and does it make more sense from your perspective to invest in the recurring revenue type of sells reps because you're getting these areas where all the robotic procedures are going to one area versus hiring somebody who is going to sell capital equipment and drive that into a new hospital where they need to see their patients leaving? Thanks.
Unidentified Company Representative: So, we... last quarter we mentioned investing a lot more on the procedure-driven sales force, and this we strongly believe that we can drive more procedures by having people focused on fewer sites, but going deeper. And so it's our goal to get to a metric where one sales person covers, let's say, four systems instead of five, and we're well on our way to doing that and that's where some large portion of those 57 new hires went. As far as the mix between domestic and international. We did have adds in both territories, I don't have the split out exactly...
Unidentified Company Representative: But it's also important to note that we have even in international there is a mix between direct and indirect employees, so the distributors are also committing resources and people to sell. So the international number is not going to necessarily parallel the U.S. numbers growth, because we do have that secondary sales org there too.
Unidentified Company Representative: But we will continue to invest in both capital sales people who sell the system as well as the sales force that supports the ongoing procedure development and procedure use of the system.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, I think the way to think about it also is that, a few years ago when a -- really predominantly in urology and some cardiac and... a little bit general surgery, with a handful of procedures that really were being focused on. Now today we are talking about a host of new procedures that we weren't talking about a couple of years ago. As that list grows and we hope it to grow and continue to grow for a long time, the dependency of the person in the operating room goes up, because there are new procedures that require their attention, there are more and more surgeons that they are trying to get trained. And as that wheel turns that is really accretive to the business. So I would expect that number to continue to be... that role to be a really important role in the overall strength of the business.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That was our last question for today. As I have said on prior calls, we believe the adoption is driven by significant shift in patient value. And we are focused on increasing that patient value by improving surgical outcomes, and reducing surgical trauma. While the FDA clearance of the da Vinci-driven endorisk [ph] stabilize during the removable of the beating heart, warning language may not have a significant near-term impact. We do believe that it will have a significant long-term positive impact in the adoption of Robotic coronary artery surgery. Professor [indiscernible] who is the Chief of cardiac surgery at Arasma Academic Hospital and Trivole University Hospital [ph] in Belgium uses the da Vinci S endo [indiscernible] stabilizer for coronary artery bypass surgery. And he says that it provides, and this is a quote, rock solid stabilization for coronary vessel on the beating heart, enabling the avoidance of not only of the thrasic [ph] incision but also of the cardiopulmonary bypass system. The advantage for the patients, he says, are obvious, avoiding cracking the chest is not only a matter of cozmesis [ph], it corresponds to a much lower injury to the patient, much less inflammatory reaction, much less blood air interface, leading to a significant decrease in complications such as infections and stroke, which means shorter length of stay and a faster return to normal life and work. One of his patients, a forty-year old man wrote some letters, and he... I am going to kind of summarize that, they said, ladies and gentlemen, good day. What a wonderful world, I have endured my first hospitalization. And it was not a little intervention but a bypass operation. This meant at least three months out of my job, surely one year of unpleasant and tormenting physical shortcomings what a [indiscernible] thanks to Arasma Hospital [ph] professor [indiscernible] and Dr. Yansun [ph], and the entire team of the cardio unit as well as the robot da Vinci. My opinion has changed into wallah what a wonderful world. Some days later I walked three hours with the in-laws across Brussels Christmas market and on January 4, 2008, back to full time work. This being topped off by a eight day ski holiday in the alps. Without the invention of the robot da Vinci this would have never been in my dreams, less even a reality. Thanks to the combination of technical progress and human dedication. I am grateful with all my heart. Jean Paul [ph]. Patients like these are the strongest advocates, strongest advocates for surgery with a da Vinci system and are the very foundation of our operating performance. In terms of our expectation of ourselves to continue to deliver exceptional operating performance, I like the story of the lion and the gazelle. Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up, it knows it must run faster than the fastest lion or will be eaten. Every morning the lion wakes up and knows it must outrun the slowest gazelle or will starve to death. The moral, it doesn't matter whether you are a lion or gazelle, when the sun comes up, you better be running. In closing I assure you that we remain committed to focusing on vital few things that truly make a difference as we strive to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. And you can count on the fact that when the Sun comes up we will be running. That concludes today's call, we thank you for your participation and support of this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking to you again in three months.

Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website, at intuitivesurgical.com on the Audio Archives section under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of the fourth quarter as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. First Lonnie will present the quarter's business highlights. Marshall will follow with a review of our fourth quarter's financial results. Next, Aleks will discuss sales and marketing highlights. Then Ben will provide our financial forecast for 2008, and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I would like to introduce Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you for joining us today. 2007 was our third consecutive year of over 60% top line growth. We grew total revenue to 601 million for the year and 189 million for the fourth -- in the fourth quarter. Operating highlights for the fourth quarter are as follows. We sold 78 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 50 during the fourth quarter of last year. 20 of those systems were sold to existing customers. Our international team had an excellent quarter, contributing 26 of the 78 systems sold. We're at the fourth quarter with 795 da Vinci Systems installed worldwide. Total revenue for the quarter was up 68% from last year. Instrument and Accessory revenue increased to $56 million, also up 68%. Total recurring revenue including service grew to $81 million, up 63% from the prior year, comprising 43% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $83 million, 44% of revenue before non-cash 123R stock option expense, up 98% from the fourth quarter of last year. GAAP net income grew to 49 million, 26% of revenue, up 108% from last year. Through the full year of 2007, we sold 241 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up 42% from prior year. Total revenue grew to $601 million, up 61%; recurring revenue to $276 million, up 66%, comprising 46% of total revenue. We generated $243 million in operating profit, 40.5% of revenue before non-cash 123R stock option expense, up 83%. GAAP net income grew to $145 million, 24% of revenue, up 101%. We ended the year with $635 million in cash and investments, up 102 million from last quarter and 305 million from last year, which after excluding 56 million in cash received from the exercise of stock options and adding back 22 million invested in working capital and plant, property and equipment during the year, accounts were 188% of our reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of the significant non-cash stock option and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason that we continue to believe that operating income before non-cash 123R stock option expense remains the best measure of our actual financial performance. Adoption for surgical robotics is procedure-specific and patient-driven. We continue to drive the adoption curve for robotically assisted surgery procedure-by-procedure. Some of our high growth procedures, high growth defined as over 50% for the year, included gastrectomy, pulmonary lobectomy, prostatectomy, radical cystectomy, mamectomy, nephrectomy, hysterectomy and sacrocolpopexy. Some of these, the measured of relatively small prior year basis, but we have learned from past experience that that is how now new adoption curves begin. The da Vinci S continued to dominate our systems mix, a 93% of systems sold. High definition vision systems accounted for 74% of the systems in the quarter and 66% of the systems for the ear. We continue to make significant progress in terms of innovation and efficiency in every area of our business. Some 2007 data points, you might find of interesting clue. We added 201 employees during the year, ending the year with 764 employees. Revenue per employee grew to 905,000 in 2007 compared to 756,000 in 2006. Instrument and accessory revenue per system was up 21.8% to 302,000 from 248,000 in 2006. Cash generated before cash received from stock option exercise and cash invested in working capital, property, plant and equipment was $6.96 per share. With that, I will pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Lonnie. Total fourth quarter revenue increased to $189.4 million, up 68% from $112.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, and up 21% from $156.9 million for the third quarter of 2007. Fourth quarter revenue by products category were as follows: Instrument and accessory revenue increased to 56.1 million, up 68% compared with 33.3 million last year, and 13% compared with 49.5 million last quarter. The growth rate in instruments and accessories is comparable to and a direct result of our procedure growth rate. The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we earned per procedure remained relatively unchanged at between $1,500 and $2,000 per procedure for established da Vinci accounts. Including the impact of initial orders completed with new system purchases, instrument and accessory revenue continues to be between 2,000 and $2,500 per procedure. Systems revenue increased to 108.6 million, up 73% compared with 63 million last year, and up 27% compared with 85.5 million last quarter. The increase in systems revenue reflects increased unit sales as well as an increase in the average revenue per system. Fourth quarter da Vinci Surgical System revenue reflects the sale of 78 systems compared with 50 systems sold during the fourth quarter of last year and 63 systems sold in the third quarter. Two of the system sales in the quarter involved trade-ins where a customer upgraded two of his four systems from da Vinci standard systems to da Vinci S Systems with HD. 58 of the systems sold during the quarter were our latest S model incorporating HD vision capabilities. 12 were four arm S models incorporating standard vision capabilities, 2 were three arm S models and 6 were standard systems. 26 of the system sales were outside of the U.S. compared with 17 in the third quarter. Fourth quarter average revenue per system including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades was 1.38 million, which is 50,000 more than the average revenue per system in the third quarter of 2007. The higher average revenue per system primarily reflects a favorable geographic and product mix, including a higher proportion of our sales comprising HD systems and a higher proportion of our sales being direct sales to European customers, which are denominated in euros, which strengthened relative to the dollar this quarter. Upgrades including fourth arms and HD accounted for 1 million of the current quarter systems revenue, compared with 1.6 million last quarter. Service revenue increased to 24.7 million, up 52% compared with 16.3 million last year and up 13% compared with 21.9 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by our largest system installed base as well as higher annual contract prices associated with da Vinci S and HD models. Total fourth quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to 80.8 million, up 63% compared with the fourth quarter of 2006, and up 13% compared with the third quarter of 2007. Recurring revenue represented 43% of total fourth quarter revenue, compared with 45% in the third quarter, reflecting the significant increase in system sales. Revenue outside the United States represented 26% of total fourth quarter revenue compared to 22% in the third quarter. The growth in international revenue reflects 26 system sales compared with 17 in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter 2007 gross margin of 71.4% increased compared with 69.1% realized in the third quarter. The increase in gross margin reflects higher average system ASPs, material cost reduction and productivity gains. During the fourth quarter, we established a legal entity in Mexico and entered into a three-year building lease for 34,000 square feet in Mexicali, Mexico. We expect to begin producing certain instruments in Mexico by the end of 2008. Costs associated with these activities were not significant in the fourth quarter of 2007. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 were 61.8 million compared with 54.5 million in the third quarter of 2007. The sequential operating expense increase of 7.3 million reflects increased costs associated with the growth in our top line particularly commissions, costs associated with patents acquired or licensed, increased spending on R&D, increased non-cash 123R stock compensation expense and increased headcount. We added 67 employees during the fourth quarter ending the period with 764 regular employees. The majority of these additions were to our worldwide sales and support and manufacturing organizations. Fourth quarter 2007 operating income was 73.4 million or 38.7% of sales, compared with 54 million or 34.4% of sales for the third quarter of 2007. Fourth quarter 2007 other income of 8.4 million decreased compared with $12.2 million in the third quarter of 2007. Third quarter 2007 other income included a $4.1 million gain on the sale of Hansen stock. In addition, we realized 900,000 more of foreign exchange gains in the third quarter compared to the fourth quarter. The impact of these gains was partially offset by increased interest income of 1.2 million resulting from interest earned on greater cash and investment balances. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 39.9%, which brings the annual tax rate to 39%, which is consistent with our overall guidance. We continue to utilize net loss carry forwards and employees' stock related tax benefits in 2007. The amount of employees' stock related tax benefits increased in the fourth quarter such that we now expect our cash outlay, as a percentage of pre-tax income, will be less than 6% for 2007. Our net income increased to 49.2 million or $1.24 per share, up 108% compared with 23.6 million or $0.62 per share for the fourth quarter of 2006, and up 20% compared with 40.9 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2007. Let me quickly summarize our results for 2007. Total revenue for 2007 was 601 million, up 61% compared with 373 million last year. Revenue growth was driven by procedure adoption and total procedures grew 74% in 2007 to approximately 85,000. Da Vinci prostatectomy, our largest procedure, grew to approximately 55,000 procedures in 2007, exceeding our target growth of 65%. And da Vinci Hysterectomy, our fastest growing procedure grew to over 13,000 procedures in 2007, exceeding our target growth of approximately 175%. Instrument and accessory revenue for 2007 was 191.7 million, up 72% compared with 111.7 million last year. Systems revenue for 2007 was 324.4 million, up 58% compared with 205.9 million last year. Operating income for 2007 was 206.7 million, up 93% compared with 107.4 million last year. Operating income included 36.3 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2007, compared with 25.3 million in 2006. Net income for 2007 was 144.5 million, or $3.70 per share, up 101% compared with 72 million or $1.89 per share last year. Now turning our attention to the balance sheet; we ended the fourth quarter of 2007 with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 635 million, up 102 million from the previous quarter-end and up 305 million from December 31st, 2006. 14 million of the cash generated in the quarter and 56 million of the cash generated during the year was associated with stock purchase activities. The remaining cash generated is primarily related to operating activities. Our accounts receivable balance increased to 130.4 million at December 31st from 120.5 million at September 30, 2007. The increase in accounts receivable is attributed to increased sales. Our net inventory increased to 32.4 million at December 31st, from 26.8 million at September 30, 2007. Our inventory turns at December 31st of 6.5 times per year was slightly lower than the seven turns at the end of the previous quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic - Vice President of Business Development and Strategic Planning: Thank you, Marshall. During the fourth quarter, we shipped 78 da Vinci systems, which as Marshall mentioned, included a two system trade-in. Geographically, 52 systems were sold in the United States, 17 in Europe and 9 into rest of world markets. 72 of the 78 system shipments were da Vinci S systems and the remaining six were standard da Vinci systems. Of the 72 S systems sold, 58 were high-definition or HD systems. We finished 2007 with 795 cumulative da Vinci systems worldwide; 595 in the U.S., 136 in Europe and 64 in rest of world markets. Independent of the trade-ins, 18 of the 76 systems sold during the quarter represented repeat system sales to existing customers. International system sales were strong and included four da Vinci systems into France, three into Belgium, three into Germany and three more into Korea. Clinically, we had an excellent quarter, a quarter in which we experienced strong sequential procedure growth in all four targeted surgical specialties, both U.S. and internationally. A particular note was the strength of the international procedure growth, most notably within dVP. Our gynecologic procedure business placed by da Vinci Hysterectomy and da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy, registered the largest sequential percentage growth for the quarter, whereas urology registered the largest absolute procedure growth. We also experienced significant growth within our kidney business, specifically da Vinci Nephrectomy and Partial Nephrectomy and with the addition of several key cardiac centers during 2007, we saw strong growth in our da Vinci Mitral Valve Repair business. Ben will provide you with updated procedure guidance during his review. in Q4 we had 110 da Vinci related clinical papers published within various peer-reviewed journals across multiple surgical specialties. We also launched 2 new instruments; a new Atrial retractor and the dual-blade retractor, which is targeted for kidney procedures. Neither of these products will significantly boost our top line, but each will offer our surgeon customers added utility, leading to a more optimized surgical procedure. Optimizing each of our target procedures through the development of new products and product enchantments remains an important priority. We participated in multiple conferences within urology, gynecology, general surgery and cardiothoracic surgery during the quarter. However, I'll limit my review to only a few. The First Annual International Gynecologic Oncology Robotics Symposium was held at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, with professional attendance estimated at 175. The program covered several da Vinci procedures and included live surgery transmissions. During one of the live cases a type 3 radical hysterectomy performed by Dr. John Boggess demonstrated how the most complex and demanding open cancer operations can be performed through minimally invasive techniques. This very demanding procedure to the audience's surprise was completed in less than 3 hours. During the Ask the Experts panel, Dr. Boggess reported that of his 300 plus da Vinci cases, he has aborted only 3 radical hysterectomies due to metastatic disease, converted one oncologic patient due to severe fibroids and converted only one patient due to an unforeseen excessively large ovary. He concluded by saying and I quote, contraindications are disappearing as are complications. But it takes time to ramp up. We came away from this symposium with an even stronger positive impression of Intuitive's market position within the field of GYN oncology. As the 36th Global Congress of the AAGL held in Washington DC, da Vinci procedures were featured prominently on several fronts. The AAGL put on 2 post graduate robotics courses as well as a robotics breakfast symposium. All of these programs were very well attended. In addition, the general AAGL program features several abstracts, posters, presentations, summarizing clinical experiences with da Vinci Hysterectomy, both benign and malignant Myomectomy and Sacrocolpopexy. Dr. Ricardo Estape from the University of Miami presented a retrospective review of his first 26 da Vinci Radical Hysterectomies compared to his last 10 laparoscopic radicals and his last 20 performed through an open technique. He compared blood loss, operating time, lymph node yields, length of hospitalization and pain management regiments within each cohort. Regarding blood loss, for da Vinci patients, it was 90 milliliters, laparoscopic 320 milliliters, open procedures 840 milliliters. Operating time was 142 minutes for da Vinci patients, 212 for laparoscopy and 122 for open. Lymph node yields in the da Vinci procedure was 34 compared to 21 in the lap case and 32 in his open procedures. Length of stay was similar for both da Vinci and laparoscopic patients; 1.3 and 1.4 days, however, for patients undergoing open radical hysterectomy, 3.7 days. And finally pain medication; patients undergoing a da Vinci Hysterectomy or a lap procedure were on pain meds for an average of 8 days compared to 22 days for pains subjected -- for patients subjected to an open radical hysterectomy. Again, these were his first 26 patients. He went on to say that his da Vinci operating times are now consistent with its open times. When you overlay all the data he presented, it's pretty clear to see why he and others have chosen the da Vinci approach for their oncologic procedures. Dr. Maria Bell from Stanford Medical Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota presented cost data from one facility that measured both the direct and indirect cost associated with open hysterectomy, da Vinci Hysterectomy and laparoscopic hysterectomy. Her data showed that the total hospital cost for an open hysterectomy was $8,763, which compared to $6,388 for the da Vinci Hysterectomies and $5,873 for her lap test. The average length of stay for an open hysterectomy was 3.69 days, compared to 1.19 days for a da Vinci Hysterectomy and 1.37 days for a lap hyst. I think its important note that it's estimated at almost two-thirds of the 600,000 or so hysterectomies performed annually in the U.S. are still being performed with conventional open surgical technique. And when evaluating this data on a cost and performance basis, it becomes pretty clear why she and her group have converted the overwhelming majority of their hysterectomies both benign and oncologic to da Vinci. One of the emerging da Vinci procedures in 2007 was da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy, which had a similar growth rate to da Vinci Hysterectomy. Though the opportunity is smaller than our da Vinci Hysterectomy opportunity, perhaps 50 to 60,000 U.S. cases, the patient value is tremendous, which we believe sets up well for patient consolidation. The gold standard therapy for advanced vaginal vault prolapse has always been sacrocolpopexy performed through an open laparotomy incision. However, the procedure is highly invasive and carries with it a long recovery period. These patients are typically hospitalized for three days and experience post surgical morbidity lasting 4 to 8 weeks. At the AAGL Pre-Congress Robotics Course, Dr. Patrick Culligan from Atlantic Health System in Morristown, New Jersey, a surgeon who has performed over 50 da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy procedures reported that his patients are experiencing significantly less blood loss, approximately 50 milliliters versus 265 milliliters for this open technique, and are being released from the hospital in 23 hours. Postoperative morbidity within his patient base is ranged from one to two weeks. He has also reported a decrease in complication, which is a da Vinci theme that repeats from procedure-to-procedure surgical specialty to surgical specialty. Capping off the congress was a live transmission of a da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy performed by Dr. Anthony Visco from Duke University Medical Center. The interest from GYNs and urogynaecologists performing sacrocolpopexy is strong. This matched with the patients' desire for a gold standard operation performed minimally invasively, sets up well for hospital seeking to expand the women's health initiative. The 25th World Congress of Endourology was held in Cancun and was attended by nearly 1300 urologists. There are multiple dVP presentations made at this meeting by both U.S. and non-U.S. surgeons. But to me, perhaps the key takeaway from this year's congress was the sheer volume of da Vinci-based moderated presentations and abstracts, 145 in total. In addition to dVP, many of these presentations were focused on da Vinci Nephrectomy and Partial Nephrectomy for kidney cancers, cystectomy and urinary diversions for bladder cancers, pyeloplasty and other urologic disorders. The patient value that da Vinci brings to the treatment of all of these corresponding diseases is substantial and as da Vinci Prostatectomy grows towards the standard of care for prostate surgery in the U.S. and other countries, it is clearly pulling with it several da Vinci opportunities within the vertical of urologic surgery. This year's world congress was further validation of this cumulative pull-through. And within our procedure business, we experienced it more in Q4 than in quarters past, and we would expect it to continue. In closing, I'd like to bring your attention an important paper that was featured in the November edition of the American Cancer Society's publication, Cancer. As many of you know, the last remaining criticism for performing dVP was the absence of longer term published results. It certainly hasn't slowed acceptance of the procedure, but it was outdone than the West. The cancer journal published five-year dVP outcomes emanating out of the Vattikuti Urology Institute at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. The series compared the results of Henry Ford's first 200 patients to the result of their last 200 patients, between the years of 2000 and 2006. The total population of their dVP series was 2,766 patients. The patients were operated on by three different surgeons. This comprehensive review compared cancer controlled functional outcomes such as sexual health and urinary incontinence, length of hospital stay and several other key variables. The authors stratified the metrics by age, cancer grade, PSA and Gleason score, body mass index and other criteria. There is far too much data that go into on this call. But by almost any measure, the 5-year data was viewed as very positive. The authors' conclusion is as follows and I quote, the results of this large series of 2,766 patients confirms the promising outcomes reported in earlier robotic-assisted prostatectomy series. Perioperative complications remain low and long-term outcomes are favorable. Continued experience and technical refinements of the procedure demonstrate improvements in operative parameters and functional results. Robotic-assisted prostatectomy remains a safe and reproducible treatment for men with clinically localized prostrate cancer. This concludes my overview and I will now turn the time over to Ben.
Benjamin B. Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing our 2008 financial forecast on a GAAP reporting basis, including stock compensation expenses and I will also provide an estimate of our stock compensation expenses separately, so you can calculate meaningful comparisons and exclude these non-cash expenses. Starting with procedures, we continue to expect dVP and dVH adoption to drive the growth in our 2008 recurring revenues. For 2008, we expect dVP procedures to grow approximately 40% from a base of approximately 55,000 procedures performed in 2007. And we expect dVH procedures to grow approximately 150% from a base of approximately 13,000 procedures performed in 2007. In addition, as Aleks mentioned, we expect to have continued growth in other procedures, particularly in the GYN specialty. Overall, we expect total procedures to grow at least 55% in 2008 from a base of approximately 85,000 procedures performed in 2007. With regard to revenue, we expect our total 2008 revenues to grow approximately 40% over 2007. Instrument and accessory revenues, which are specifically driven by procedures performed, are expected to grow approximately 55% over 2007. We expect this growth to result from procedures performed on new system placements as well as increased utilization of existing installed systems. System utilization has steadily increased and currently averages about three procedures per system per week across the installed base. System revenues have continued to grow strongly and we expect to see continued growth in system placements throughout 2008. We are forecasting system revenue to grow approximately 30% over 2007. We expect this growth to come from an increase in unit shipments. Our system ASP reached a high of $1.38 million in Q4 2007 and averaged approximately 1.33 million for all of 2007. As a reminder, our system ASP can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of geographic mix and product mix. For 2008, we expect our average system ASP to be approximately the same as last year, which was $1.33 million. We expect service revenues to grow approximately 44% above 2007 levels with an average annual service revenue per installed system of $135,000 per year. With regard to our first quarter 2008 revenue, please note that the fourth quarter is seasonally our strongest quarter for system sales. And we typically place more systems in the fourth quarter than the following first quarter. As a result, we expect Q1 2008 revenues to be sequential last year lower than the fourth quarter of 2007. Then we expect to grow revenue sequentially each quarter throughout 2008. With regards to gross profit margin, we expect to have modest year-over-year improvement in gross margin, driven primarily by improvements in manufacturing efficiency. Much of the improvement we experienced in Q4 2007 came from favorable product mix, geographic mix and exchange rate changes. These factors are difficult to predict and can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Therefore, we are forecasting gross margins to be between 69 and 70% for the year. Before moving to operating expense, I will provide a forecast on stock compensation expenses to explain clearly how these non-cash charges will likely change in 2008. As you know, our stock prices appreciated significantly since this time last year, and as a result, we expect charges to income for stock compensation expense to be significantly higher in the coming year. To review, in 2007 we recorded approximately $36 million in stock compensation expense distributed as follows: 6 million in cost of goods sold, 8 million in R&D and 22 million in SG&A. For 2008, assuming our present day stock price, we expect to record approximately $60 million in stock compensation expense distributed as follows: 10 million in cost of goods sold, 13 million in R&D and 37 million in SG&A. this will represent approximately a 67% increase in stock compensation expense for the year. Now on a GAAP basis, I will describe our forecast for operating expense growth in 2008. In the R&D expense category, we are continuing to invest in the development of new products internally as well as co-development with third parties. We expect our R&D expenses to grow approximately 52% in 2008. Many of our R&D program expenses are planned in the first half of the year. As a result, we expect R&D expense to grow sequential from Q4 2007 to Q1 2008, then remain relatively flat for the remainder of the year. In the SG&A expense category, we are continuing to expand our field sales organizations to drive the growth of procedures as well as system placements. As Aleks mentioned, the several new procedures emerging this presents opportunities for us to increase the number of procedures performed per installed system. To drive this growth in procedures, we are planning to increase our ratio of coverage of clinical sales people per account. We believe this will be instrumental in driving the continued adoption of existing and new procedures. We are also continuing to add system sales people to drive the 30% growth in system revenues for 2008. For the year, we expect our SG&A expenses to grow approximately 40%. Since a significant portion of our field sales headcount is being added in the first half of the year, we expect SG&A expense, as a percent of sales, to increase sequentially in Q1. For the year, we expect SG&A expense, as a percent of sales; to be about same as it was in the full year 2007. We expect total operating expense including FAS 123R stock compensation expense to grow approximately 43% for the year. We expect operating income to grow approximately 40% for the year. For Q1 2008, we expect operating expense to grow approximately 10% sequentially from Q4 2007. Other income expense for 2008 is expected to come in between 36 and $40 million, driven primarily from interest income on cash and investments. With regard to income tax, as mentioned in the past, we expect to report a GAAP tax rate of approximately 39% for the year. However, we expect our effective cash tax expense to be less than 25% for 2008. We expect to start reporting the benefits of our international tax strategy in the form of a lower GAAP tax rate in 2009. Regarding shares outstanding, we currently have 38.5 million common shares outstanding, we also have approximately 3.1 million option shares outstanding. Depending upon our average stock price during the year, a portion of the 3.1 million option shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation. For calculating EPS in 2008, we expect the share count to be approximately 40 million shares in Q1 and going to approximately 40.8 million shares by the end of the year. Finally with regard to capital investments, we have acquired property next to our corporate headquarters. We plan to construct a 154, 000 square foot manufacturing, engineering building on this property over the next two years. This will translate into higher capital expenditures than we've had in recent years. For 2008, we expect to spend approximately $60 million in capital expense, which is up from approximately $20 million spend in 2007. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Tao Levy with Deutsche Bank.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Good afternoon everyone.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Tao.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Hi and congratulations on a very strong quarter and year. There are a couple of questions on my end. In terms of gynecology, given the strength and given Aleks, all the comments that you've made regarding the clinical benefits, is there any way that your guys are now comfortable sort of comparing it to the progress that we saw in the past with urology?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You know Tao I think, the place we comfortable comparing it, it really is not in the metrics as much as it is in the patient value. We are continuing to see more and more patients that are again looking for facilities that are performing these operations, we continue to see physicians and professional societies, they are making it a bigger part of their agendas at their meetings, it becomes difficult to compare when you look at the number of systems we had installed at the time versus the number of systems we have today and the general acceptance of robotic surgery today. So I don't think we are ready to tell you, it's going to look -- the growth curve is going to resemble dVP. Ironically, it is fairly similar today, in fact dVH is probably a little bit bigger, but I don't think we can say that going forward -- and faster I should say, and bigger in overall procedures.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And also on the manufacturing side, with this -- you're doing in Mexico, the gross margins guidance that you're giving, should we expect that to hit initially, is it also the more of a S systems, is it the euro, any better sense there?
Benjamin B. Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: Yeah Tao, this is Ben. We incorporated all of those factors and coming up with our estimate of 69 to 70% gross margin for the year. There's some start-up cost with the Mexico operation, however, we're containing to bring down some cost just in our normal manufacturing efficiencies and that's going to sort of balance that out the -- and as we said in the past, we really don't try to forecast what's going to happen with exchange rates.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And you look the new system sales that are taking place today. Obviously in the past urology was still the drive, it's probably still one of the big drivers. How does gynecology fall into that selling process today?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well each day becomes a bigger and bigger part of that process. I would say that we're still focused on -- our sales people are still focused on developing robotics initiatives within the hospitals which includes multiple specialties. Gynecology plays a bigger and bigger role each day. I would also say that the uptake of gynecology has in many instances put stress on hospitals that only have one system and I think you've seen again this quarter probably being the strongest side of that and a total of 20 systems that went to repeat customers. So, gynecology is a big player in that and I think will continue to be and continue to expand.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: And just lastly, I couldn't -- obviously the guidance that you're providing on the sales line are 40%, it's the highest level that you've ever started the year off. Any -- what's the thinking behind the big number that you're putting out there. Is this early in the year, what's giving you the confidence that 2008 looks like it's going to be a potentially even better than 2000 -- from last year, this early?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: To tell you if I take you back to last year if you remember hysterectomy was even earlier on in the adoption process and with the history that we have had this year with hysterectomy and how its about that as well as continued progress in some of the other procedures, and some of the pull-through procedures that we were identifying earlier, we feel more confident right now.
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Great, thanks a lot.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Tao.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eli Kammerman with Cowen.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: Yes, thank you and good afternoon.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Eli.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: First question is, as you look at the growth for prostatectomy, can you tease apart what fraction of the growth is related to additional market penetration for radical prostatectomy as a strategy and what growth -- what is the component of growth from replacing open surgery.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Eli I don't know that we will ever be able to tell you that exactly. It's just not a metric that has reliable data behind it and they track by agencies, et cetera. I can tell you anecdotally when we speak to our physicians, more and more we are hearing that patients who would have been candidates and would have seeked out radical -- breaky therapy specifically are now seeking out da Vinci Prostatectomy, we know that's taking place. On top of that we know that on a geographic expansion basis we are seeing tremendous outside of the United States. So when you put all of those factors together it brings us a level of confidence when we look at 2008 growing by at least 40%. So it's hard for us to tell exactly what it's going to look like and from what bucket we are going to take. But we do measure it both in terms of our estimates of prostatectomy in the market as well as new cancer -- new prostate cancer patients.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: Okay, thanks for that answer. One more question please. For your guidance you said you expect to see revenues grow by 40% and operating income grow by 40%. So it seems strange that you are not expecting to see any gains in operating leverage despite higher utilization of the systems for more procedures. How do you explain that?
Benjamin B. Gong - Vice President, Finance and Treasurer: Eli, this is Ben. So, keep in mind that that's on GAAP basis and even though the operating expenses are going 40%, it's handicapped by this growth in the non cash FAS 123R expenses. And so if we were to take that out then the operating income that Lonnie has talked about it's certainly is going to go more than 40% as a year-over-year. So, you have that. And we did mention that there is little of improvement in the gross margin which is I think what are you points on in terms of better utilization.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Hazan with Oppenheimer.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good evening gentlemen. This actually Michael Tieu [ph] in place of Amit Hazan.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Michael.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, just have a couple of questions for you guys. The first one is it appears that you are at least about 33% penetrated into the tier 1 hospitals mostly in major metropolitan areas. So, on a go-forward basis how should we think about system placement growth?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: A couple of things. Again I think it's important to know when you look at however you want to stratify hospitals and large hospitals or tier 1 or tier 2 or tier 3 that when you are talking about the largest hospitals our view is that those and we see it more and more every quarter that those become very strong candidates for multiple systems, so I would probably push on that math [ph] there a little bit. Secondly when you look at what we did this quarter, specifically of the 52 US hospitals that I shifted the 52 systems sold in the US, 8 of those systems went to hospitals less than 200 beds which un-stratified in any of those measures. So what we begin to see more and more each quarter as the procedures become proliferated the number of hospitals or I should say the number of beds in those hospitals is probably less important than it was in the past. So we look at the US market and we think that evidence of raising that guidance throughout the year and giving, I think, strong guidance in '08 that we are very, very bullish on it.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and my next question is related to that in terms of purchasing. This has been the topic that's been discussed for a lot of capital equipment manufactures and wanted to find out if you are seeing any sort of slowdown or pressure in terms of the overall credit crunch market and anything that's affecting financing and what are the percentage of your customers who are financing and are they financing through you or third party that you are arranging?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The answer to that is, no. We -- as we talked to -- we have about half of our sales force right now meeting to -- going through their pipeline and I had -- McNamara asked them if they had seen any delay because of the credit crunch and the answer: no one responded with any kind of positive experience. So now one has seen any deals delay because of it. We have third party financing in about 15% of our sales. We believe that hospitals will prioritize their investments where they believe that brings the greatest value to them in terms of incremental patients and revenue and we think we place very well in that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And two last questions. One is the impetus behind the CalTech IP settlement. So you think that opens the Door for competitor to come in. And my last question how do you view the U.S. -- all U.S. units in terms of utilization. Do you think they will be able to reach the same levels as in the U.S.?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: On the CalTech question we don't see any door opening from the point of view of the settlement with CalTech; it was just a few patterns. The resolution doesn't leave us weakened in anyway in terms of our defensive position on patents.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The Utilization of Systems, OUS, it actually varies region by region. We certainly have some regions that are even higher utilization in the Untied states and -- but we would expect that overall as the adoption of dVP and dVH in other procedure gets greater internationally that we are going to see growth in utilization OUS as well as United States.
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Just a closing comment on that, we have and we talked about this in the past, dVP OUS lagged the US and we've talked about 07 words come up very rapidly and it grew tremendously in '07. dVH is the same way. It's early in the United States and it's even earlier outside the United States. So there's a nice step function there that I think when all procedures caught up there is really no reason to suggest that that it should be any difference. But there is going to be a lag effect.
Unidentified Analyst: So when do you think you will be able to start to quantify in the growth for dVP and DVH internationally or can you give us some sort of range as far as where do you use see international procedures going for 2008.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think we have given that guidance. It's hard for us to tell you what -- in project with accuracy what that's going to look like in '08. We can just say that in '07 it was a -- I mean you can look at the system placements in that -- what that tells you is that procedures are in demand outside of United States because procedures drive system sales. So it was very, very strong in '07.
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And yes, just to repeat, we think procedures would grow approximately 55% or more worldwide and it's going to strong both domestically and internationally.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Ed Shenkan with Needham.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company: Congratulation on a great year.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Ed.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company: Our question comes from a survey that did out of 157 physicians and we found that over 50% of the current da Vinci users are interested in buying additional systems in the next three years. Additionally we found 80% of the systems are being used by multiple groups within a hospital. And we are just wondering are you expecting in the future that groups are going to have dedicated machines for their specialty or they are going to doing more sharing across the departments then they are already doing.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: If you look at some of the larger da Vinci customers are across the da Vinci customer base you will find both. You will find that in some instances you will have dedicated cardiac system, you will have dedicated urologic systems and you will have dedicated Gynecologic systems. Now when you if you look at your data and just overlay it to the actual numbers that we just reported we had roughly 24% or 25%, a quarter of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were second systems and I don't think that's the second, third or forth systems, repeat systems. So I don't think its far off of the entire year. So I would just say that we believe that fully developed robotics initiatives will require multiple systems and at what rate that happens within an individual hospital will be difficult to tell and vary from place to place.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company: A couple of questions on cardiac surgery. We are hearing feedback from cardiologist that there is a system lag time with regards to beating heart surgery. Will you be able to address this with new technology integrations in the future or is this going to require significant system improvements just a great area wondering how soon we are going to be able to get there?
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me comment on that. We just came from STS and there may be some other comments but we have currently some products for review with the FDA but I talked with our hospital that does a lot of beating hearts in Belgium and they just bought an AS last year and the Chief of Surgery -- Chief of Cardiac Surgery there told me that the AS has made a huge difference in terms of these that he can -- on beating heart he can certainly do a double and -- single and double vessels, very easily with that and our stabilizer and on arrested heart with a stabilizer being hit [ph] to all vessels of the heart and was just -- and just said it had made a huge difference in terms of the -- and so we did off the couple of products we have a fourth arm, a stabilizer that is not cleared yet in the United States and we have the atrial retractor that is a -- this is for mitral valve repair but the atrial retractor for -- that is approved and also our fourth arm instrument. Both have made the control and the ease of doing these procedures, taking a long way including the capabilities that we brought with AS system.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company: So, Lonnie with those improvements, how far are we becoming more of a standard of care in cardiac surgery and just sort of put it in perspective is this two, three years and what kind of development must occur for that to really happen.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't know that it's -- I can't predict that. I will say that we have a cleared adoption mitral valve. That curve is real and you got to get some place and other thing that we're seeing a lot of growth, we saw a good growth in TCAP and the Scopica [ph] bypass issue a bit, but lobotomy for lung cancer or the thoracic surgeons are... I've run into several SDS that were just enormously enthusiastic about it. So, really you build credibility, we'll build credibility with mitral valve and we will see the recent general medical article comparing stents and bypass that was favorable. But there's a lot of these cardiac surgeons are very, very conservative. They will come -- they will not come early, they will come -- the mitral valve there's a big event -- was a big move, there's not only that we have multiple centers doing it but when the Clinton Clinic takes a major role in it and we will see. But I don't like to put a time frame on it. We have got enough procedures. We have got not only what we are seeing with prostatectomy and now cystectomies, Nephrectomies, but you are seeing on hysterectomies, sacrocolpopexies and myomectomies and we are seeing all these procedures. So we got a good pipeline of procedures building growth. So our growth will come from both penetrating the procedure, adding additional procedures and geographic growth and those are the drivers of the growth for the foreseeable future.
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And for cardiac there is not one specific tool that you need to make it you know massively more easier to do?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You know Ed it's not about in a revasc procedure specifically; it isn't about one thing. It started with stabilization. I mean in the old days when we had a three-arm system with good stabilization, there were still that were able to get through that operation and we continue to address those things organically where we can and partner with other people where we need to. And so we have done that in the past with Medtronic, there's a lot of adoption of the U-Clips that they have and the procedure is evolving -- it's evolving pretty well, but we are not going to paint the picture that it's just one thing missing and you are going to throw a switch and all of a sudden everybody's going do revasc. It is growing, it will continue to grow, but that's about as far out I think as we can say.
Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company: Thanks very much.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We have our time for two more question and -- I think that's 1 or 2.
Operator: Our next question is from Rick Wise with Bear Stearns.
Miroslava Minkova - Bear Stearns: Hi, Lonnie, hi Ben.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Miroslava Minkova - Bear Stearns: It's actually Miroslava for Rick.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Miroslava Minkova - Bear Stearns: I will be speaking for Rick today and I guess my first question is of the 20 systems that you sold to repeat customers in the US this quarter, can you just give us some more insight as to -- did these additional place -- getting an additional system, does it have to do with growth in the current procedures or is it more related to new procedures that they may be experimenting with or adopting.
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I would say that it goes across the entire spectrum but the big driver is that they are expanding the capacity they had on their single system or their second system and required a third or fourth system now. The mail clinic in Las Chester, Minnesota which is a very busy centre in urology and other areas purchased a third and a fourth system. But at the same time we have a small hospital in -- outside of Orlando, Celebration Hospital, which is 122 bed hospital that bought first and their second. So I think you are going see that it's going go for a number of different reasons at the -- the core of that message is that people need extra capacity to do all the procedures that they are stacking up.
Miroslava Minkova - Bear Stearns: Okay, great, thanks for the color. And also in your 55% procedure growth guidance for the year, you mentioned -- Ben mentioned that there are several new procedures emerging. Maybe so if you could us a little bit more color which are -- exactly are these procedures, I know you kind of talked about a lot of procedures. But the top ones among them would actually be very helpful.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So if you look within the verticals and while just keeping in verticals of let's say gynecology, sacrocolpopexy for vaginal vault collapse is on that list. It's something that is continuing to grow rapidly at the same pace really as hysterectomy. Below that you have myomectomy, removal of the fibroid but preservation of the uterus also has nice growth. In the urology side of it, you are looking at the kidney operations, removal of the kidney or removal of part of kidney, partial nephrectomies. Both of those are showing very nice promise, a very nice growth as is the work around bladder cancers, prostatectomies and urinary diversions. So when we look out through those verticals, those are definitely on that list. And I would say within cardiac we continue to talk about mitral valve repair and it's becoming more and more of a mini part of that cardiac story. I think we have time for --
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: One more caller.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: One more caller.
Miroslava Minkova - Bear Stearns: Thank you.
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Thanks guys, so let me bring it here the rear here. Just one quick question -- a couple of quick questions here. On new accounts is it a safe assumption as you look at the U.S. businesses replacements, on a go forward basis, the opportunity in the U.S. is really for existing customers. And we think we have peaked out in terms of new account generation in the U.S.?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No. Actually the there are lot of new systems placements David this past quarter as there are every quarter. As Alex mentioned before we had aided those new system placement were in hospitals that have less then 200 beds and really the opportunity here to place systems at hospitals that don't have any is still very, very large.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Okay, so the opportunity growth in your mind [ph] is still pretty balanced between new U.S. systems, suggesting U.S. systems and then your OUS expansion?
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's correct.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Okay, very helpful. I think gross margin and I know your margins have been an area of conservatism here throughout 2007, but Marshall could you just tell us of the 250 point inter-year gross margin improvement, how much of that do you think was currency?
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It was less than half -- less than half of that was currency.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then the -- so the other 150 or so bips is there any reason to not assume that we see another 150 bips in 2008?
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, because there was part -- part of that of also a system mix and we think we have been riding some favorable system mix between geographically, we sell through distributors at lower prices and we don't believe the debt mix will continue at the same level we are predicting a slightly different mix. And then we have build into the model some level of increase but again as Ben mentioned earlier, there are some costs to sort of balance that out in terms of investments in Mexico and so forth.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then just last quick question. The Mexican investment towards the back half of '08, is that going to be instruments or system and what percent of manufacturing capacity you think you would have online by the end of the year.
Gary Guthart - President and Chief Operating Officer: This is Gary. It's primarily instruments and it will be a small percentage coming online at the end of the year.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley:
Less than 10%:
Gary Guthart - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes in 10%
Marshall L. Mohr - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I want to comment on this on the margin expansion and then -- we -- it's always a balance fro us to try to mange make sure we are investing enough in the future to sustain growth as well as tread margins -- our margins are excellent. We are going to invest and now sometimes quite frankly grow with our paces our ability to higher the quality of people we want and so we will get some of that. But we're trying to manage here pretty closely. The [indiscernible] not going to over invest in people but we are going to invest and are investing heavily in future products and we will continue to do that and if that needs flat margins or even a decrease in margins, we will take that.
David Lewis - Morgan Stanley: Thank you for the color.
Lonnie M. Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think we are -- do you have time for one more or so? Okay. Let me close then. As I said previously we focused on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls. And our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma and I'd like to -- I would like to probe the pretty human face what this means in the lives of three different patients. First the letterhead [ph] by one of Dr. William Schwab's patients at the University of Pennsylvania and this is dated January 23, 2008. This patient says I've been blind for one year and I am scheduled to get a guide dog in early February. Last Tuesday I was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor on my left kidney. The doctors of the University of Pennsylvania health system pulled out all the stops for me. Today eight days later, I am cured of cancer and still able to go to boot camp in 2 weeks to get my new guide dog. My primary care position Robert -- Dr. Robert Keidel [ph] called me Tuesday afternoon with the news about the cancerous tumor on my left kidney. It wasn't an emergency but I had to come out very soon. Recovering from the surgically curable cancer normally takes at least six weeks and involve a partial removal of the rib in the lower back just to reach the kidney. My problem was that in less than three weeks I was growing to the Guiding Eyes School in Yorktown Heights, New York to know my new service dog and learn how to navigate without my cane. Dr. Keidel contacted Dr. William Schwab at the part of urology who specializes in minimal invasive robotic surgery. Dr. Keidel thought that Dr. Schwab technique might be best for my situation. The email started flying. Last Thursday I saw Dr. Schwab with my wife Joanna. He explained that my tumor is small enough and that the place is fairly accessible for his robotic surgical method. He showed my wife a short video so that she could see how it worked. The most important thing was that if he performed the surgery the next day I would be ready and able to go to guide dog school as scheduled. Even though Dr. Schwab didn't normally perform surgery on Fridays he said he would arrange it all for me, and get to guide dog school on time. Dr. Schwab performed surgery last Friday, the procedure called a Microscopic Robotic Partial Nephrectomy. He removed the tumor and some joining tissue from my left kidney. I spent that weekend recovering in a Presbyterian Hospital. I came home Monday morning. Today is Wednesday, I walked for 45 minutes on a treadmill this morning and another 45 minutes this afternoon around the city, I feel very good and I am now cured of cancer. Wow, I'm still scheduled to go to Guiding Eyes on February 4th, to get my companion and start my new life, hurray. I was lucky to have a benefit of this robotic procedure. The physicians at PAN went the extra mile for me. Thank you everyone at UPHS who helped make this possible for me. And earlier this week at STS I talked to Dr. Michael Smith, a cardiac surgeon in Cincinnati and he described his experience with a 40-year old woman who had recently -- who had already undergone six sternotomies for recurring tumor in the left atrium of her heart, referred to in for a 7th procedure. The women broke down in tears when he told her that he can remove the tumor with a da Vinci system without performing a sternotomy. And finally Dr. James Potter [ph], Urologist at Swedish hospital in Seattle who has had a da Vinci prostatectomy himself performed da Vinci prostatectomy on a very fit 50-yuear old -- 55-year old man and CEO of a company in the Seattle area. The patient said, less than two week post-op, one week after the catheter was removed, he ran a six mile loop around Lake Union. He felt so good that he ran another 6.5 mile loop the next day. A week later he ran a 10-K race at Bitaltrails [ph] Park in Belgium [ph]. The next week he triathlon in Billingham with his son consisting of a 0.5-mile swim, a 22-mile bike ride, and a 5-mile run. In the following week he ran the 26.2-mile Seafair marathon. Persons like these are the strongest advocates for surgery with a da Vinci system and are the very foundation of our operating performance. In closing I assure you that we remain committed to focusing on the vital few things that truly make a difference as we strive to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. That concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support in this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months.
Operator: This concludes today's conference, you make at this time. Thank you.

Before we begin, I would like to inform you that commentsmentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements.Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as aresult of certain risks and uncertainties.  These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in thecompany's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Prospective investors arecautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.  Please note that this conference call will be available foraudio replay on our website at IntuitiveSurgical.com, on the audio archivesection under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press releasehas been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlightsof our third quarter as described in our press release announced earlier today,followed by a question-and-answer session. First, Lonnie will present the quarter's businesshighlights, Marshallwill follow with a review of our third quarters’ financial results. Next Alekswill discuss sales and marketing highlights; then Ben will provide our updatedfinancial forecast for 2007. And finally, we will host a question-and-answersession. With that, I would like to introduce Lonnie Smith, ourChairman and CEO.
Lonnie Smith: Thank you for joining us today. As you can see from ourpress release, we continue to drive the adoption curve, robotically assistedsurgery, and continue to deliver significant top-line and bottom-line growth. Operating highlights for the third quarter are as follows.Total revenue grew to $157 million, up 64% from last year. Instrument andaccessory revenue increased to $49.5 million, up 70%. Total recurring revenueincluding service grew to $71 million, up 64% from the prior year, comprising45% of total revenue.  We sold 63 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 46 during thethird quarter of last year. Positive systems were second, third, and fifthsystems to existing customers. Our international team had an excellent quarter contributing17 of the 63 systems sold. We ended the third quarter with 719 systemsinstalled worldwide.  We generated an operating profit of $63 million, 40% revenuebefore non-cash 123R stock option expense, up 92% in the third quarter of lastyear. GAAP net income before unusual operating income items grew to $37million; 24% of revenue, up a 116% from last year. We ended the quarter with $533 million in cash andinvestments, up $86 million from last quarter. During the past nine months wehave generated $203 million in cash, which excluding $42 million cash receivedfrom exercise of stock options amounts to 169% of our reported GAAP net income. This is reflection of the significant non-cash stock optionand statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income. And as a reason ofthat we continue to believe that operating income before non-cash 123R stockoption expense remains the best measure of our true financial performance. The da Vinci S continued to dominate our systems mix,accounting for 95% of the systems sold in the quarter. High definition visionsystems accounted for 68% of the systems. We launched the Hem-o-lock clipapplier, the G 400 compatible, Endo PK a Dissecting Forceps and a new smoke evacuating8 millimeter Cannula. We grew our Intuitive team by 38 members this past quarterto 697. We continue to see solid procedure growth. Year-over-year prior growthremained strong, while quarter-over-quarter sequential growth was impacted bysummer vacations, particularly in Europe.Procedure growth and adoption continues to be procedure specific, patientdriven and the primary growth driver of our business. With that I will pass the time over to Marshall Mohr ourChief Financial Officer.
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Lonnie. Total third quarter revenue increased to$156.9 million, up 64% from $95.8 million for the third quarter of 2006, and up12% from $140.2 million for the second quarter of 2007. Our revenue growth isdriven by procedure adoption, which was consistent with our previous guidance.Da Vinci hysterectomy and prostatectomy continue to be the primary drivers ofour business. Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows;instrument and accessory revenue increased to $49.5 million, up 70% comparedwith $29 million last year and 8% compared with $45.8 million last quarter. Thegrowth rate in instruments and accessories is comparable to and a direct resultof our procedure growth rates. Third quarter revenue growth rate of 8% reflectsthe expected impact of seasonality, particularly overseas. The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we earn perprocedure remained relatively unchanged at between $1,500 and $2,000 perprocedure per established da Vinci accounts. Including the impact of initialorders completed with new system purchases, instrument and accessory revenuecontinues to be between $2,000 to $2,500 per procedure. Systems revenue increased to $85.5 million, up 63%, comparedwith $52.4 million last year and up 15% compared with $74.1 million lastquarter. The increase in systems revenue reflects increased unit sales as wellas an increase in the average revenue per system. Third quarter da Vinci Surgical System revenue reflects thesale of 63 systems, compared with 46 systems during the third quarter of lastyear and 56 systems sold in the second quarter. 43 of the systems sold duringthe quarter were our latest S model incorporating high-definition visioncapabilities; 13 with four-arm S models incorporating standard visioncapabilities; four were three-arm S models, and three were standard systems. Our third quarter average revenue per system including allda Vinci models, but excluding upgrades was $1.33 million, which is $25,000more than the average revenue per system in the second quarter of 2007. Thehigher average revenue per system primarily reflects a favorable geographicmix, including direct sales to European customers, which are denominated inEuros, which strengthened relative to the dollar this quarter.  Upgrades including 4th arm in HD, accounted for $1.6 millionof the current quarter systems revenue, compared with 1.1 million last quarter.Service and training revenue increased to $21.9 million, up 52% compared with$14.4 million last year, and up 7% compared with $20.3 million last quarter.  The growth in service and training revenue is primarilydriven by a larger system installed base, as well as, higher annual contractprices associated with da Vinci S and HD models. Total third quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument,accessory, service and training revenue increased to $71.3 million, up 64%compared with the third quarter of 2006, and up 8% compared with the secondquarter of 2007.  Recurring revenue represented 45% of the total third quarterrevenue, compared with 47% in the second quarter, reflecting the significantincrease in the system sales. Revenue outside the United States represented 22% oftotal third quarter revenue, compared to 19% in the second quarter. The growthin international revenue reflects 17 system sales, compared with 12 in thesecond quarter; and lower instrument and accessory revenue growth, reflectingseasonality associated with summer vacations. Our third quarter 2007 gross margin of 69.1% increased,compared with 67.1% realized in the second quarter. The increase in grossmargin reflects higher system selling prices in favorable manufacturingabsorption. Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2007 were $54.1million, compared with 49.1 million in the second quarter of 2007.  The sequential operating expense increase of 5.4 millionreflects increased spending in R&D, increased headcount, and increases inother cost associated with growth in our top-line, partially offset by areduction in non-cash 123R stock compensation expense. We added 38 employees during the quarter, ending the periodwith 697 regular employees. Majority of the additions were to our world-widesales and support and manufacturing organizations. Third quarter 2007 operating income was $54 million or 34.4%of sales, compared with 45 million or 32.1% of sales for the second quarter of2007. Our third quarter 2007 other income of $12.2 million increased ascompared with $5.2 million in the second quarter of 2007.  Our third quarter 2007 other income included a $4.1 milliongain on the sale of Hanson Medical [chairs] and $1.8 million of foreignexchange gain associated with the increase in Euro relative to the U.S. dollar.Excluding these gains, the increase of 1.1 million is primarily the result ofinterest earned on greater cash and investment balances.  Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 38.2%,which is slightly lower than the 39% we recorded in the second quarter. Ourthird quarter tax rate reflected certain one-time benefits, and we expect ouron-going tax rate to be around 39%.  We continue to utilize net loss carry forwards and employeestock-related tax benefits in 2007. The amount of employee stock-related taxbenefits increased in the third quarter, such that we now expect our cash outlayas a percentage of pre-tax will be less than 10% for 2007. Our international tax structuring activities are proceedingon schedule, but will not generate a reduction in our global tax rate untilafter 2008. Our net income increased to $40.9 million, or $1.04 pershare, up 137% compared with $17.3 million, or $0.45 per share for the thirdquarter of 2006, and up 33% compared with $30.7 million, or $0.79 per share forthe second quarter of 2007.  Excluding the gain on the sale of Hansen shares and the foreignexchange gains, net income for the third quarter was $37.2 million or $0.95 pershare. Let me quickly summarize our results for the first ninemonths of 2007. Total revenue for the first nine months of 2007 was $411.4million, up 58%, compared with $260.1 million last year. Operating income for the first nine months of 2007 was$133.4 million, up 85%, compared with $71.9 million last year. Operating incomeincluded $26.2 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first ninemonths of 2007, compared with $18.5 million in 2006.  Net income for the first nine months of 2007 was $95.4million or $2.46 per share, up 97% compared with $48.4 million or $1.27 pershare last year. Excluding the gain on the sale of Hansen shares and theforeign exchange gain, net income for the first nine months was $91.5 millionor $2.36 per share. Now, turning our attention to the balance sheet. We endedthe third quarter of 2007 with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $533million, up $86 from the previous quarter end, and $203 million from December31, 2006. $21 million of the cash generated in the quarter and $42 million ofthe cash generated in the nine-period was associated with stock purchaseactivities. The remaining cash generated is primarily related to operatingactivities. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $120.5 millionat September 30th, from $105.6 million at June 30, 2007. The increase inaccounts receivable is attributed to increased sales. Our net inventory increased $26.8 million at September 30,2007 from $24 million at June 30, 2007. Our inventory turns at September 30,2007 of seven times per year were slightly lower then the 7.4 turns at the endof the previous quarter. And with that I would like to turn it over to Aleks who willgo over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights.
Aleks Cukic:  Thank you, Marshal. During the third quarter we shipped 63da Vinci systems, 46 systems in the United States,11 in to Europe and six in to rest of worldmarkets. 60 of the 63 system shipments were da Vinci S systems, four of whichwere three-armed S systems, while the remaining three were standard da Vincisystems. Of the 60 S systems sold, 43 were high-definition or HD systems. Wehad no trade-ins during the quarter. The 63 systems sold brings to 719 accumulative da Vincisystems worldwide; 545 in the U.S, 119 in Europeand 55 in rest of world markets. 5 of the 63 systems sold during the quarterrepresented repeat system sales to existing customers. Repeat systems salesincluded the Cleveland Clinic, NorthwesternUniversity Hospital,the Lahey Clinic and Hackensack Medical Center.The sale to Hackensackrepresented their fifth da Vinci system. Internationally we had an excellent quarter, which includedfive additional da Vinci systems into Belgium,three into Korea and ourfirst system into Russia.Clinically we had another good quarter. There was seasonally slow quarter forelective surgeries. We experienced solid sequential procedure growth. Ourgynecologic procedure business paced by da Vinci Hysterectomy, registered thelargest sequential percentage growth for the quarter, followed by Urology. Ben will provide you with updated procedure guidance duringhis review. We had 57 da Vinci related clinical papers published within the variouspeer-reviewed journals. We also launched three new products the Hem-o-Lock clipapplier, which was developed in collaboration with Teleflex Medical. The G 400compatible and Endo PK Dissecting Forceps which was developed in collaborationwith Gyrus ACMI and the 8 mm Cannula with a smoke evacuation outlet. Although none of these products is expected to significantlyboost our top-line, each will offer our surging customers added utility,leading to a more optimized surgical procedure. We are building this procedurebusiness one procedure at a time and therefore optimizing each of our targetprocedures through the development of new products and product enhancementsremains an important priority. Of the peer-reviewed literature I mentioned there is oneparticular study I'll bring to your attention. In the October 8th edition ofthe Archives of Internal Medicine, a study entitled short and long termmortality of localized prostate cancer set out to compare survival rates forprostate cancer patients undergoing primary radiation therapy, radicalprostatectomy, as well as other treatment options. The consortium of authorsrepresented surgical departments, radio-oncology divisions and cancerregistries from Geneva University in Geneva, Switzerland, the National University ofSingapore, and the University of Turin in Turin, Italy. The population cohort included 844 men that have beendiagnosed with localized prostate cancer. 158 of these mentioned underwent aprostatectomy. 205 were treated with radiotherapy, 378 selected a watchfulwaiting regiment, 72 received hormone therapy and 31 were treated with othertherapies  The result, at five years, the survival rates were fairlyconsistent between cohorts, except for the hormone therapy cohort, which wasstatistically inferior to the other treatments. However, at 10 years, thesurvival results changed materially. The prostatectomy cohort showed an 83%survival rate, radiotherapy 75%, watchful waiting 72%, but when you look alittle closer at the data, specifically within the larger segment, men under 70years of age, the survival rate gap between prostatectomy and radiotherapywidened to 92% compared with 78% respectively. Said another way, the study reported that for man under theage of 70 with localized prostate cancer, the risk of dying from the diseasewithin 10 years, following prostatectomy was 8%, as compared with 22% followingradiotherapy. The author's conclusion and I quote "our study resultssuggest that surgery offers the best chance of long-term prostate cancerspecific survival, in particular for younger patients with poorlydifferentiated tumor"  Many of our customers have reported shifts in theirhospital's treatment mix away from primary radio therapy toward dVP. With theincreased awareness for earlier PSA testing leading to earlier stage diseasedetection in younger patients, we would expect this mix shift to continue. We participated in multiple conferences within urology,gynecology, general surgery, and cardiothoracic surgery during the quarter.However, I’ll limit my review to only two. This year was the first time weattended the American Urogynecology Society Conference or the AUGS, which tookplace in Floridaand was attended by approximately 900 urogynecologists. Urogynecologist are the specialists, which among otherthings, focus on the condition of vaginal vault and uterine prolapse, whichlead to pelvic floor and vaginal vault reconstructed procedures.  The society put da Vinci front and center at the conference.The post graduate course entitled, The Surgical Management of Pelvic OrganProlapse focused on da Vinci’s roll within these prolapsed procedures, and wasone of the most popular courses offered. The satellite symposium entitled, Robotic Applications toSurgically Repair Vaginal Vault and Uterine Prolapse was in fact the mostpopular symposium at this year’s conference. It was so well attended that theorganizers had to move it to a larger venue to accommodate the standing[remaining] crowd.  Dr. Tony Visco from Duke Universitypresented his experience, rationale, and surgical technique for da Vincisacrocolpopexy. Followed by Dr. Arleen Song from the University of Michigan,who covered da Vinci Hysterectomy for those patients that required removal ofthe uterus prior to sacrocolpopexy.  The rationale for da Vinci's use within these complexoperations is very consistent with our Patient Value equation, which translatesinto efficacy over invasiveness, which in this case means eliminating a largeopen incision to create what is considered a durable gold standard repairprocedure. Overlapping the AUGS Conference was the Mayo Clinic'sAdvance Techniques in Endoscopic and Robotic Gynecologic Surgery Symposium,which took place in Maui. Perhaps the mostnotable at this year's program was da Vinci's role within all sub-specialtycategories of gynecology, which include GYN Oncology, Laparoscopic GYN,Urogynecology, and Reproductive surgery. Presentations were made by Mayo Clinic staff surgeons andguest faculty on da Vinci Hysterectomy for endometrial and cervical cancer, daVinci Hysterectomy for Benign Disease, da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy, Myomectomy andfor Excision of Invasive Endometriosis. As we are experiencing in urology, establishing a strongclinical story around a common, but complex procedure provides us with theopportunity to expand da Vinci's utility within an entire specialty. And in thecase of the GYN specialty, that procedure is da Vinci Hysterectomy; and it'sbrought a new awareness to minimizing the invasiveness of other complex GYNprocedures. In the fourth quarter we will be participating in severalkey GYN conferences, including the European Society of GYN Oncology Conference,which takes place in Berlin; The AAGLConference in Washington DC;and the First Annual International Robotic GYN Oncology Symposium, which issaid to take place at the Universityof North Carolina in Chapel Hill.  That concludes my overview, and I will now pass the timeover to Ben.
Ben Gong: Thank you, Aleks. As in previous earnings calls, I will beproviding our updated forecast on a GAAP reporting basis, including stockcompensation expenses. I will also provide an estimate of the stockcompensation expenses separately, so you can calculate meaningful comparisonsthat exclude these non-cash expenses.  As previously mentioned, we had better than anticipatedgrowth in revenue and profit in the third quarter, and we expect this momentumto continue through the remainder of the year. Therefore we are increasing ourprevious guidance for revenue and profit for 2007.  Starting with procedure growth, we continue to expect dVPand dVH adoption to drive the growth in our recurring revenues. Our proceduresperformed in Q3 were inline with our expectation for these areas, and wecontinue to expect dVP growth for the year to be at least 65%. We also continueto expect dVH growth for the year to exceed 175%. Instrument and accessory revenues are expected to growbetween 70% and 75% over 2006. This is consistent with our forecast from ourlast earnings call, and it reflects our overall procedure growth from lastyear. Our systems sales were strong in the third quarter acrossboth domestic and international markets, and we expect to have continued growthin system unit placements in the fourth quarter. We are now forecasting systemrevenue to grow between 48% and 52% over 2006, which is up from our perviousforecast of 30% to 35%. A majority of this growth is resulting from an increase inunit shipments, while part of this growth is also driven by higher averageselling prices for systems compared with the prior year. Our system ASP wasapproximately $1.33 million for the third quarter, and $1.3 million evenyear-to-date. For the fourth quarter we expect our system ASP to beapproximately $1.3 million. We expect service revenues to grow approximately 52% above2006 levels, up from our previous forecast of 50% growth. This increase isdriven our higher system placement this year. Overall, we now expect our total 2007 revenues to growapproximately 55% to 58% over 2006, compared to 45% to 50% previously forecast. With regard to gross profit margin, we had an up tick in thethird quarter, driven primarily by higher average selling prices from favorablegeography mix and by manufacturing productivity improvements. We expect tomaintain the benefit from productivity improvement through Q4. However, wewould be cautious about predicting the same favorable geographic mix we had inQ3. Therefore, we are forecasting gross margins to be approximately 68% for boththe fourth quarter and the year-end. Moving to operating expense, we are also expecting to spendmore on both R&D and SG&A expenses then we previously forecast. First,higher revenues are driving higher sales commissions, which are reflected inSG&A expense. We expect our SG&A expense to grow between 41% and 45%for the year, which is up about 1 percentage point from our previous forecast. In the R&D expense category, we've mentioned in our lastearnings call, we have stepped up our investment in internal projects, as wellas co-development projects with third-party corporate partners. We arecontinuing to increase our activities in these areas. In total, we expect ourR&D expense for 2007 to be 55% to 60% higher than our R&D expense for2006, which is up from our previous forecast of 48% to 52%. We expect our total operating expense for 2007 to be 45% to47% higher than our total operating expense in 2006. These forecast for grossmargin and operating expense, include the impact of FAS 123R stock compensationexpense. Our third quarter operating income included $8.7 million of non-cashstock compensation expenses allocated as follows; $1.4 million in cost ofsales, $5.2 million in SG&A and $2.1 million in R&D. For the year, weexpect the impact of FAS 123R to be between $35 million and $36 million withthe percentage allocation to P&L lines consistent with Q3. Other income expense for the third quarter included $6million of income, which we did not expect to repeat in the fourth quarter,specifically, gains on sale of equity investment and foreign exchange gains.Interest income for the fourth quarter is expected to be between $6.5 millionand $7 million. For the year, we expect total other income and expense to bebetween $28 million and $29 million. With regard to income tax, we expect to report a GAAP taxrate of 39% for the fourth quarter, which will result in an annual GAAP taxrate of between 38.5% and 39%. However, we expect our effective cash taxexpense to be less than 10% for 2007. Regarding shares outstanding, we currently have 38.2 millioncommon shares outstanding, and we also have approximately $3.3 million optionshares outstanding. Depending upon our average stock price during the fourthquarter, a portion of the 3.3 million option shares will be added to the fullydiluted shares calculations. Calculating EPS in Q4, we expect the share countto be approximately 39.5 million shares. By concluding our prepared remarks, we will now open thecall to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Mr. Tao Levy, you mayask your question.
Tao Levy - DeutscheBank Securities: Good afternoon everyone.
Jerry Mcnamara: Hi Tao.
Tao Levy - DeutscheBank Securities: Hi. I guess my first question, on the strength in theinternational market, it seems like Belgium, the folks over there getreal excited about robotic surgery. Maybe you could talk about how thatdevelopment happened. Was it the government that ended up purchasing the fivesystems or is it a group of hospitals?
Jerry Mcnamara: Tao, this is Jerry. We have been growing our procedures in Belgium overtime and we have had installationsin Belgiumsince early 2000s. And at the beginning of Q3 we had 10 sites up and runningand we have been extremely well staffed and this really set the table to beable to sell five additional new systems during the quarter. So, now that toanswer your last question and I have nothing to do with the government.
Tao Levy - DeutscheBank : Is it something that you think international will continueto see, not necessarily in Belgium,but across other areas?
Jerry Mcnamara: Well, business is generally strong internationally. Thatbeing said, procedures were seasonally softer in the third quarter as weexperienced long vacation times for both patients and physicians. Overall, weexpect to see a lot of continued growth in the US and for the rest of the year weare not expecting or forecasting a higher percentage of business internationalsales than what we have seen earlier this year.
Tao Levy - DeutscheBank : Alright, and if I look at the full year guidance, I guesseffectively the fourth quarter, Ben, the right way to think about systemplacements in terms of total number is this somewhat slightly higher than thethird quarter. Is that the, if I do the math quickly?
Ben Gong: Yeah, we are expecting some sequential unit growth in fourthquarter over the third quarter and that's incorporated in that new systemrevenue guidance of 48% to 52%.
Tao Levy - DeutscheBank : Perfect. And then just lastly, what's the capital spendingenvironment like in the hospitals these days just given some of the creditconcerns. Obviously, given the third quarter didn't seem like there was anyimpact. But as you go ahead and start to talk to at the hospitals oradministrators, any changes there that we should be looking at?
Jerry McNamara : Tao, this is Jerry. No negative changes, actually we see ourpipeline for Greenfieldand repeat system sales to be stronger than ever.
Tao Levy - DeutscheBank Securities: Great, thanks a lot.
Operator: Mimi Pham of HSBC, you may ask your question.
Mimi Pham - HSBC: Hi good afternoon. For international geographies, do youplan on expanding into any new geographies next year that aren't earlier andselling in now?
Ben Gong: Mimi, this is Ben. We mentioned that we just sold our firstsystem into Russia.
Mimi Pham - HSBC: Yes.
Ben Gong: And one thing that we see is, you first place something intoa new geography and it takes a little bit of time for that geography todevelop. So you're seeing that with places like Korea. And so we expect that, nowthat we got our first one into Russia, maybe there will be some activitiesthere not right away, but maybe a couple of years down the road. 
Mimi Pham - HSBC: And in these international markets, are they being drivenmainly by da Vinci Prostatectomy and Hysterectomy like in the US. 
Ben Gong : Primarily urology is strongest outside the United States. Many of thoseterritories lag the US by about two years, and so right now one of our biggestgrowth drivers in Europe is dVP, and likewise in Asia some of the activitieswe're seeing there are primarily urology at this point. 
Aleks Cukic: But within, for example, Korea which was also a strongmarket for us specifically this quarter, you see multiple specialty focusedrobotics programs that include general surgery that include cardiac surgery.It's fair to say prostate is a big driver, but its not limited toProstatectomy.
Mimi Pham - HSBC: Thanks. And on the margin side, can you break up the productmargins for the disposables in the system, and what would consider the ceiling?
Ben Gong: We did tick the gross margin guidance by about 1 point, andyou saw that we got two points better this quarter than last quarter. So, thebig drivers for that were some manufacturing improvements as well as ASPimprovements, but some of that was from foreign gains.  It's not materially different than what we had before, soyou have product gross margins somewhere on the order of 17%, and that'sroughly the amount for systems and for instruments and accessories alike, andyou still have the gross margins for a service lower than that, due to the waywe account for the training expenses.
Mimi Pham - HSBC: But in terms of a ceiling is there?
Lonnie Smith: Let me comment on that. We've got strong margins, we'llcontinue to drive efficiency. But I am not sure, we're going to try to drivethat in to margins, and maybe more deliver it back to our customer. And so Iwouldn't plan on expanding margins dramatically, even though we may drive costdown pretty dramatically or we will continue to do it.  I think we are not -- there comes the point where we want abalance this in fairness to our customers as well, and so we will share some ofthe benefits with them.
Operator: Mr. Tim Nelson of Piper Jaffray, you may ask your question.
Tim Nelson - PiperJaffray: Hi, you talked a little bit about seasonal slow down inprocedure growth rates, was that any different between OUS and US geographies?We expect that sort of thing in and outside we've heard you pronounced it.
Lonnie Smith : Clearly more pronounced in the overseas markets.
Jerry McNamara: And it was similar to our experience in the last few yearsTim.
Tim Nelson - PiperJaffray: Could you comment on what the differential utilization rateare between your installed base outside the United States and in US.
Ben Gong: Just repeating some of the stuff we said in the past. Theoverall utilization rate internationally is a little bit lower than in United States, but there are certainly pockets,lets say in Scandinavia or let's say in Belgium where you have utilizationrates that are actually pretty similar.  But since there are typically newer users out thereinternationally, you don't have the same sort of overall productivity on thosesides as a whole.
Tim Nelson - PiperJaffray: Okay. And you also mentioned strong pipeline on systems. Canyou again give us some feel for the geographic split for that? Is the strengthof the pipeline for here in the United Statesand outside the United States equally or is there somedifferential?
Lonnie Smith : I think it's pretty consistent globally.
Tim Nelson - PiperJaffray: Okay. And then you did have -- I am curious on your expectedgrowth for dVP and dVH for the year, because you commented on what it was inthe quarter?
Ben Gong: No I guess that what's indicative is we have the sameforecast for the year as we did last quarter. So, our growth in the quarter wasin line with what we are expecting and therefore for the year it's about thesame.  And then the [repeat], the overall procedure growth like theinstrument and accessory growth for the year is expected to be 70% to 75% andthe biggest drivers continue to be dVP at least 65% and dVH at least a 175%.
Tim Nelson - PiperJaffray: Okay. And we are really starting to get some good tractionin dVH outside of the oncology's segment, are you seeing an acceleration there?
Aleks Cukic: I don't know Tim that I would use terms like acceleration.We are getting I think very strong representation both within the oncology aswell as the complex benign cohort. And I will tell you that we are picking upsome momentum in things like sacrocolpopexy and Myomectomy. So I would say it'ssort of a global statement that the category of GYN is coming along quitenicely, similar to how we had talked about in the past it seems to be unfoldingthat way.
Tim Nelson - PiperJaffray: Great.
Lonnie Smith: And just a comment on dVH and what's driving the underlyinggrowth, and I think this is more than just dVH, but it's the patient behaviorin terms of speaking, what I'd say our higher value-added treatments. I recently spoke with a Senior Executive of a large publiccompany. And I was surprised that he was familiar with our company. And I askedhim about it and he said, well, his wife was diagnosed with endometriosis andrequired a hysterectomy. And she then went to a GYN of 17 years who hasdelivered two of their children and told him that she was interested in havingit done robotically as she was been on the internet. And his response wasfirst, I would never heard of hysterectomy performed by a robot. His secondresponse was, wouldn't it be nice if a robot could do everything that I do. Andlast he said, I think it's ridiculous. So, what do you think she did?
Tim Nelson - PiperJaffray: She went to find somebody who could do it robotically?
Lonnie Smith: Find the right oncologist, that's right, who did herprocedural robotically. I tell that story only because I think it'sfundamentally, it is what is underlying the growth of our company. It's thatmore and more patients are proactive in seeking treatments that providesuperior outcomes to them in terms of effectiveness and impact on their dailylives and it's certainly true, GYN with hysterectomies, sacrocolpopexies,myomectomies, as Aleks has mentioned.
Tim Nelson - PiperJaffray: That's very interesting, because you generally think ofwomen having much great loyalty to their OB/GYN and men to their urologist, soI am glad to hear that. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Eli Kammerman of Cowen, you may ask your question.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen: Thanks very much. My first question is about two years agoin the third quarter of '05, you had margins that were pretty similar to the marginsyou just reported and I am wondering if the reasons were similar then orsomething else happened two years ago to make the gross margin and theoperating margin tick up so much for that period?
Ben Gong: Two years ago we did not have SFAS 123R and when we startedreporting stock compensation expenses, remember it hits the gross margin line,as well as the operating expense line. When you saw a down tick, I am thinkingthis is what you are asking, when you saw a decrease in the gross margin line,part of it was that stock compensation expense and then now that we've gottensome of these productive gains that we talked about, now we are back at thelevel that perhaps we were at before SFAS 123R.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen: Okay. All right, all right. The other question I have is,are you actively encouraging or promoting new uses in surgical oncology,specifically for rectal cancer? And can you just describe what's going on inthat particular surgery it does seem to bear some physical resemblance to lot ofthe other types of lower pelvic surgeries?
Aleks Cukic: Yeah, that's a good observation and obviously you aredealing in a narrow male pelvic region, which is very similar to prostatectomyand the vascularity associated with that region is pretty high and the area orthe work area is very tight. So, it does set up pretty well for the things thatwe have seen da Vinci do well at. We just came off the ACS Meeting literally last week andthere seems to be a, I don't want to say renewed interest, because there isalways been interest, but more interest than in the past and continuing to moveminimally invasive surgery through colon and rectal surgery. There have been alot of attempts at it. There is hand assist approaches and what not. But, it issomething that we are looking at. I think we have a fair amount of interest outthere. As far as promoting, I wouldn't use that term because we are exploring,I think it's probably a better term, but there is a lot of interest that's outthere right now.
Eli Kammerman - Cowen: Alright, thanks very much for those answers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent [Reece] from Wachovia.Your line is open.
Vincent Reece -Wachovia: Hi guys. Can you talk just a little bit about the ventureyou guys did with Cardica with the C-Port Flex A. I think you guys haveperformed the surgery with them and just how that effects what you are lookingat in cardiothoracic?
Aleks Cukic: I think, there is no venture with Cardica. I think you areprobably referring to a couple of press releases around one of our customersthat incorporated one of their products with the da Vinci operation. And so,there is really not a lot to comment on there. I mean, we've worked with a lotof companies and we've worked with a lot of companies in that particular spaceover the years, Cardica being one of them. But, there certainly isn't anyventure there and how it effects what we are doing, it’s speculative certainlyat best at this point. So, we'll let the customers decide where and how theycan use our system and where and how they can use their system. And if there isa natural intersection point that will be great.
Lonnie Smith: The time will tell. I mean, they've got some interestingtechnology, they are working on it, they have done and we support everyone whohelps us to drive cardiac to a more minimal invasive procedure. 
Vincent Reece -Wachovia: Okay, great. And in urology, are you still seeing erosion ofsome of these other competing paradigms, and more specifically with radiationtherapy is it a brachytherapy, first is directed beam radiation or both of thembeing impacted or is it more of a watchful waiting?
Aleks Cukic: It's really hard for us to tell you, it's such a dynamicsituation, and all we really have to go on what our customers are telling us.We've had situations where large brachytherapy based programs have moved a lotof those patients to da Vinci Prostatectomy. We have examples of primaryradiation treatments; again that were fairly large in numbers that havereduced.  But at the same time, there is always and we shouldn't sayalways, but there is a combination of both of them in many operations, wherethere is some cancer that's remaining and they will use external beam and cleanup procedures. There is just a lot of movement that's going on, so I think itwould be difficult for us to tell you exactly what that looks like.  But it is something that we are hearing is continuing, andas patients and younger patients are getting diagnosed, the data I thinksupports now, again there is another piece of data that's out there, thatsupports long-term survival and prostatectomy. And so, that I think as thepatient becomes more informed becomes a bigger consideration.
Vincent Reece -Wachovia: Okay, great. And then finally with that international itseems that there was a little bit more acceleration rest of world than Europe. Is that more of a artifact of a lot of largenumbers or you guys think some traction there that you hadn't seen before?
Jerry McNamara: Overall our international pipeline's billing very well andtiming is always difficult to predict, and so we expect overall theinternational system sales to grow, rest of world versus Europe it's hard toforecast them separately.
Lonnie Smith: But we started out in Europeand so we have -- we are more established there. We are building also expandingour distributors in the smaller, rest of world markets, and as that happens asJerry says the dynamic is going to be -- [most] its body as some of these guyscome up. But everyone's in a while they really start to gain some traction andthe early that [stay up] it's just the way the markets develop. It's usuallyEurope, then comes United States,then its back to Europe and then it's the restof the world and so we are just in that cycle.
Vincent Reece -Wachovia: Okay great thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Rick Wise from Bear Stearnsyour line is open.
Rick Wise - BearStearns: Good afternoon everybody.
Lonnie Smith:  Rick.
Rick Wise - BearStearns: Let me pick up on the couple of comments that were discussedbefore. The pipeline is strong you made it very clear, US and OUS. Is itequally strong by procedural dVH and dVP or is dVH carrying more of thebacklogs team, as it were at this point?
Aleks Cukic: Again Rick I think what we have talked about in the past andit remains true, is that, that a program that we are trying to establish be itUS or OUS has a number of specialties in mind.  In other words, when we are selling a system we are tryingto incorporate Urology and Gynecology and Cardiac and general surgery. That'sno different from OUS and US. So I would say that as we made clearProstatectomy and Hysterectomy are the fastest growing procedures.  But I would be careful to think of these as specific to oneprocedure. In other words, they are buying it only for Urology or they'rebuying it only for Gynecology. When they come in, they tend to have supportfrom multiple specialties.  Now what happens after it's installed, and what that mixlooks like is different. But you could suspect that Urology is going to get onquickly, it's going to grow faster. Gynecology and Cardiac in general are goingto get on etcetera, etcetera.  So, I would say that that hasn't changed, but urology on a globalbasis is definitely proliferating Gynecology slower than it is in the UnitedStates, but it is spreading around the world, and then General Surgery andCardiac are slow-steady areas. 
Rick Wise - BearStearns: Lonnie was kind enough to remind us how critical theconsumer or the patient is to driving a robotic choice in surgery. Is thatprompting you maybe particularly in the dVH areas, any unique marketinginitiatives Aleks?
Aleks Cukic: Again, I think when you are using terms like marketinginitiatives, I think if you look at what has happened and continues to happenin Urology, and I would say it's actually happening in Gynecology, is that,hospitals recognize the value and the power of a women's health initiatives,and so you will see da Vinci fit in very nicely to minimally invasivereproductive procedures for Myomectamy or pelvic floor reconstructions orbenign or malignancies. And that is taking place.  And certainly where you reside on the east coast, I'mgetting close all the time of people that are hearing radio ads, televisionads, billboards etcetera. You know we are doing things like, putting togetherdVH.com. We have a number of marketing support in internet-focused areas, butthe patient awareness is something that hospitals do, and some of them do itreally very well, and I think are the recipients of those patients.
Rick Wise - BearStearns: Let me focus on two questions that both have implications oflooking ahead. As we wrestle with our models, I realize it's early to thinkabout '08 and you are not ready to give '08 guidance today.  But just directionally so we can think about it, is it - twoquestions essentially. Is it reasonable to think about sequential unit growthof some magnitude for the next three to five quarters as far as the eye couldsee? How do we just conceptually think about that? And second, I have to note that one of my favorite hobbyhorse is the possibility of positive operating leverage is quite evident thisquarter with EBIT income up, I think 110% of my eyes are working here, wellabove the [64%] you grew revenue.  Is it reasonable to think that that kind of leverageconceptually continues into the next year?
Ben Gong: Rick this is Ben. So we will definitely give you someguidance next year in our next conference call. I don't think we are preparedto give you guidance on 2008 today.  We are certainly continuing to see momentum from the thirdquarter to the fourth quarter. So generally speaking, things are going verywell, definitely driven by dVP going at 65% year-over-year and dVH at 175%.  So there's likely to be growth next year absolutely. But wewill get more specific about that next quarter. And then getting to your pointon leverage, I think Lonnie, expressed some of this earlier, is that. It's notour intent to continue to lets say drive our margins higher.  As an example, when we launch new products we said in thepast that our new products were at lower gross margin when we launch them,because our costs on delivering new products is a little bit higher.  So, in our efforts to continue to drive procedure growth,use the existing procedures or new procedures, we are going to make sure thatwe put our products out there that can drive that growth and we are not sointent on driving that leverage if you will higher.
Lonnie Smith: Well, and as Ben pointed in the numbers this quarter, ourR&D effort is up, our development efforts are up, and we will continue toinvest there as fast as we can find the talent that really drives it.  So, we are in this, as I pointed out to you couple of times,we are in this for the long-term and trying to build a business that last. Andwe will continue to invest in the business, but we will invest where we thinkwe have the most leverage.  And so I wouldn't count on a whole lot of -- we may get somebecause it's growing faster than we can invest, but we are not trying to get alot of operating leverage at this point of time.
Rick Wise - BearStearns: Got you. Just one last quick one or not, in recent weeksthere was some anxiety about possible emerging competitive products in Korea,and there is on going discussions about other modalities presenting incrementalcompetition for da Vinci. Aleks, Lonnie, how should we think about some ofthese issues, and maybe just update us with your thoughts and just?
Lonnie Smith: Let me ask, let Garyanswer that question.
Rick Wise - BearStearns: Okay. 
Gary Guthart: Anyway, as we look at it, there are competitive groups thatwe know of working in Asia, Europe, and North America.The recent announcement from Koreaand other places has not been a surprise, nor do they represent an eminentthreat.  We think our barriers to entry are significant from productsthat produce outstanding clinical results, are easy to operate, reliable and costeffective. There are broad and growing range of instrument and imaging optionsthrough our pipeline of significant new products that will both increaseefficacy and easy of use for our products and new procedures and in existingprocedures, a strong relationship with our customers through our field andmarketing organizations, a deep patent portfolio and a strong set of regulatoryapprovals. That said, we believe that computer aided surgery is in its infancyand we cultivate relationship with research centers and third-party groupsworldwide to help us develop ideas and monitor trends. We believe we are takingthe necessary steps to remain leader here and we will keep watching anddeveloping.
Rick Wise - BearStearns: Thank you so much.
Lonnie Smith: Thank you. We have time for one more question.
Operator: And our next question comes from [David Louis] for MorganStanley. Your line is open.
David Louis - MorganStanley: Good afternoon. Running tight on task, I'll be brief here. Idon't want to beat the dead horse, but I want to come back to margins and thathas been and obviously senior management less bullish on margin increases. But,just on gross and SG&A, if you think about gross margins, there seem to befour factors inputting to margins this quarter which would be geography mix,price increases, currency and absorption and we've got good numbers I think intwo or three of them. It appears that absorption was over a 150 bps and Iappreciate Lonnie's comments on passing the stock off to customers. But,absorption doesn't appear to be something that would go away. So, I guess I amhaving a hard time seeing how gross margins only go up a 100 bps in thisquarter. Is it something that, go ahead.
Lonnie Smith: I will let Ben answer those numbers. You are talking aboutabsorption, internally we don't run the company on fully absorbed accounting,we don't. We run it by fixed and variable cost. We have to report on GAAP,understand that, but internally we manage our fixed cost and we manage ourvariable cost. And so, there is leverage and is depending upon how quickly youinvest, how hard you invest in fixed cost as you grow revenue. And so, that'swhat happens. But, it's always a trade off. We tend to try to be thoughtful andconservative in our investment for fixed costs, but we try not to be foolisheither, because as Garypointed out with the very beginning of what we think is going to become a largeand dynamic market. And we are the leaders here and I mean we are the leaderswho tend to remain the leaders. And so, we'll be investing in fixed costs,which will reduce some of that "absorption" in the process and itcould be lumpy. So, I cannot be totally predictable. When we are ramping up onprototypes that raises fixed costs, when we are investing in a new area withsome engineering staff that raises fixed costs, so I'll just tell you that I amnot saying we won't have some margin improvement at times. We also have timeswhen we [went up with it] because we've invested more heavily in fixed costanticipating the future.
Ben Gong: All right. That was extremely well said the only thing Iwould just point with you and you are on the right track is, there were someproductivity gains that we had, I would like to call them productivity gains.And that's why we are giving the guidance of 68% gross margins, which is higherthan the 67%. Let's say that we are driving towards at the beginning part ofthe year, and it's hard for us to estimate what's going to go on with thegeography mix. But, back to Lonnie's point, while we might be enjoying some ofthese productivity gains right now that we are certainly not afraid to investin certain things that are going to be beneficial for our future products.
David Louis - MorganStanley: Okay. And then just two more quick ones; On utilization, Benyou mentioned that obviously, there could be two things that impactedutilization this quarter, one being obviously seasonality and another one isgeographic mix. Historically, you've been up on utilization sequentially evenin sort of a slowest third quarter. So, is that bigger driver this quarterinternational versus utilization or they are about even?
Ben Gong: Well, the procedural growth in Q3 in the past has alwaysbeen much lower than in the previous quarters and the seasonality this quarterwas there, seasonality was also there in the last third quarter. So, what weexperienced this quarter is not necessary that's different than what we had inthe third quarter of last year. So, we know that the number is in beyond fivepercent or something like. But, when we step back and take a look at whathappened, the same sort of seasonality hit us in the third quarter this year aslast year.
Aleks Cukic: And David just as a reminder, and that the practical side ofit, as GYN becomes a larger percentage of our business, aside from the GYNoncology procedures, most of those procedures have some elective nature tothem. So, they can be postponed. For example, benign conditions and pelvicfloor, pelvic team issues and myomectomies, etcetera. So, as you look out overthe -- I mean, the core of this is patients pushing off elective surgery. So,it's just a, but sort of a subtle footnote there.
David Louis - MorganStanley: Okay. Just lastly and I'll end here. Can you just rank inorder of procedure number; because I don't think you're going to give us anyrelated metrics, myomectomy, prolapsed hysterectomy in order of procedurevolume?
Ben Gong: Well, hysterectomy is certainly our largest procedure ingynecology. And we've been at the myomectomy for a little while longer thansacrocolpopexy. So, we actually have some momentum going on there. Sacrocolpopexyis a very fast grower, so even ranking those two against each other is going tokind of tough. They are both very strong procedures for us and they are bothgrowing very fast.
David Louis - MorganStanley: Okay. Thank you very much.
Lonnie Smith: Thank you. That was our last question for today. And as Isaid previously in these calls we focus on the financial metrics such asrevenues, profits, cash flow, and procedures. But, our organizational focusremains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducingsurgical trauma. We believe that adoption is procedure specific, as it's beenmentioned and patient driven. And it's our goal to help the surgeon deliver asignificant improvement in the value to the patient and we developed a finepatient value as efficacy of the procedure divided by how invasive it is. And we hear stories daily of patients returning to theirjobs and their normal lives literally days after surgery. Such as a young womenwho is a key aid in the congressional campaign and was diagnosed withendometriosis and two large myomas, just gets to your point. She was insignificant pain and required a myomectomy. She had two close relatives in thecommunity she lives, both who were gynecologist. But, in the end, she chose togo to a gynecologist who could perform the procedure with the da Vinci Systemand she was back on the campaign trial in three days. Another patient of Dr. Mihaljevic, a cardiac surgeon atCleveland Clinic wrote to Dr. Mihaljevic saying, dear Dr. Mihaljevic thank youfor bringing robotic mitral valve repair to the Cleveland Clinic. Although, mymitral valve was diagnosed by another Clevelandhospital, with due diligences I found that the clinic alone offered roboticsurgery with a potential of a speedy return to normal activity, a more normallife. Indeed, as I write this letter I've been out of surgery fewer than sixdays and I can walk miles everyday, drive and do almost everything. My recoverydoes not include narcotics, and I had never experienced pain above the LevelII. My confidence was well placed and I thank you. My point is that thepatients like this are the strongest advocates of surgery with the da VinciSystem and are the underlying strength of our business.  In closing, I assure you that we remain committed tofocusing on the quite a few things that truly make a difference, as we striveto take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. That concludes today's call. We thank you for yourparticipation and support in this extraordinary journey. We look forward totalking to you with again in three months.

Together Gary and Jerry manage all the core functions of our company, Gary inside and Jerry outside. Both have been instrumental in building Intuitive Surgical to the company it is today.  Gary is responsible for applied research, product and procedure development, engineering and design, quality, manufacturing, business development, continuous improvement, regulatory and legal.  Jerry is responsible for worldwide sales, service, customer and sales training, marketing and reimbursement. They are both exceptional leaders and have demonstrated the necessary foresight, capacity, energy, integrity and leadership to lead the company in the future. We are committed to maintaining our focus on the core activities that drive our success. Their recent promotions are part of our long-term succession planning. We believe that the best team wins and I believe that Gary and Jerry possess leadership qualities necessary to ensure the long-term performance and success of our company.  If anyone is wondering, I am not going anywhere. I plan to remain active and involved in the business as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. However, I turn 63 next week, and I believe, and our Board agrees, that succession planning does not begin when you turn 65.  Gary and Jerry will be available to answer any of your questions. Any questions you might have during the Q&A portion of this call.  Now turning to highlights for the second quarter. Total revenue grew to $140 million, up 61% from last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $46 million, up 76%. Total recurring revenue, including service, grew to $66 million, up 70% from the prior year, comprising 47% of total revenue. We sold 56 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 39 during the second quarter of last year. 13 of the 56 systems were sold outside the United States. 12 were second, third or fourth systems to existing customers driven by procedure growth in those accounts.  We ended the second quarter with 656 da Vinci systems installed worldwide. We generated an operating profit of $54 million, 39% of revenue before non-cash 123R stock option expense, up 76% from the second quarter of last year.  GAAP net income grew to $31 million, 22% of revenue, up 84% from last year. We ended the quarter with $448 million in cash and investments, up $63 million from last quarter. We generated $204 million in the last 12 months. Because of the significant non-cash stock option and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income, we believe that operating profit before non-cash 123R stock option expense is the best measure of our actual financial performance.  While we reported $31 million in GAAP net income for the quarter, our cash and marketable securities grew by $63 million including $11 million receipts from stock option exercise during the quarter and $5 million invested during the quarter in fixed assets and working capital.  We continue to see solid sequential quarter-over-quarter procedure growth, led by gynecology and followed by urology. We believe the procedure growth continues to be the primary driver of our business. It indicates the rate of procedure adoption and drives systems sales to new and existing customers. The da Vinci S continued to dominate our systems mix, accounting for 55 of the 56 systems sold. High-definition Vision Systems dominated in the United States. 35, or over 80% of the 43 systems sold in the US, were High-definition. We launched the High-definition Vision System in our international markets at the end of the quarter. Two of the OUS Systems sold were HD.  We completed the move of our European headquarters from France to Switzerland, and grew our Intuitive team by 173 members in the last 12 months to 659 at the end of the second quarter.  With that, I will pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Marshall Mohr: Thank you, Lonnie. Total second-quarter revenue increased to $140.2 million, up 61% from $87 million for the second quarter of 2006 and up 23% from $114.2 million for the first quarter of 2007. Our revenue growth was driven by procedure adoption and we experienced growth in all of our targeted procedures during the second quarter. Da Vinci hysterectomy and prostatectomy continue to be our fastest-growing procedures.  Second-quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $45.8 million, up 76% compared with $26.1 million last year and 14% compared with $40.3 million last quarter. The growth rate in instruments and accessories is comparable to and a direct result of our procedure growth rates.  The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we earned per procedure remained relatively unchanged, between $1,500 and $2,000 per procedure for established da Vinci accounts. Including the impact of initial orders completed with new system purchases, instrument and accessory revenue continues to be between $2,000 and $2,500 per procedure.  Systems revenue increased to $74.1 million, up 54% compared with $48.1 million last year, and increased 32% compared with $56.1 million last quarter. The increase in systems revenue reflects increased unit sales as well as an increase in the average revenue per system. Second quarter da Vinci Surgical System revenue reflects the sale of 56 systems, two of which involved trade-ins, compared with 39 systems sold during the second quarter of last year and 44 systems sold in the first quarter. 37 of the systems sold during the quarter were our latest S model incorporating high definition vision capabilities. 18 were S models incorporating standard vision capabilities, one was a refurbished four-arm standard system. 12 of the systems represented repeat sales compared to 13 repeat sales in the previous quarter.  Our second quarter average revenue per system including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades, was $1.3 million, which is $50,000 more than the average revenue per system in the first quarter of 2007. The higher average revenue per system primarily reflects a higher proportion of our sales being comprised of our new HD model, which had a list price of $120,000 more than our da Vinci S standard vision model, as well as a lower proportion of our sales being comprised of da Vinci standard systems.  Upgrades including fourth arms and HD accounted for $1.1 million of the current quarter systems revenue, compared with $1 million last quarter. Service and training revenue increased to $20.3 million, up 59% compared with $12.8 million last year and up 15% compared with $17.8 million last quarter. The growth in service and training revenues is primarily driven by a larger system install base as well as higher annual contract prices associated with da Vinci S and HD models.  Total second-quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory, service and training revenue increased to $66.1 million, up 70% compared with the second quarter of 2006 and up 14% compared with the first quarter of 2007. Recurring revenue represented 47% of second quarter revenue compared with 51% in the first quarter, reflecting the significant increase in system sales. Our second quarter 2007 gross margin of 67.1% was consistent with the 67% realized in the first quarter.  Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2007 were $49.1 million compared with $42.2 million in the first quarter of 2007. Operating expenses include $7.8 million of non-cash stock option expense in the second quarter compared with $6.9 million of stock option expense in the first quarter. The sequential increase of stock option expense primarily reflects the annual grant to employees made in February. Excluding the effect of stock option expense, the sequential operating expense increase of $6.1 million reflects increased commissions associated with increased sales, increased spending on R&D- which included a minor amount of third-party development costs, increased headcount and increases in other costs associated with the growth in our top line.  Operating expenses for the second quarter also included $1.2 million of expense associated with the move of our international headquarters from France to Switzerland and the establishment of our new tax structure. Our new international headquarters is now fully operational in Aubonne, Switzerland. We added 44 employees during the second quarter ending the period with 659 regular employees. The majority of the additions were worldwide sales and support and manufacturing organizations.  Second quarter 2007 operating income was $45 million or 32.1% of sales, compared with $34.3 million or 30.1% of sales for the first quarter of 2007.  Our second quarter 2007 other income of $5.2 million increased, compared with $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2007. The increase is primarily the result of interest earned on greater cash and investment balances.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 39%, which is consistent with the first quarter. We continue to utilize net loss carry-forwards in 2007 and expect our cash outlay as a percentage of pre-tax income for 2007 will be between 15% and 20% of pre-tax income. Our international tax structuring activities are proceeding on schedule but we will not generate a reduction in our global tax rate until after 2008.  Our net income increased to $30.7 million or $0.79 per share, up 84% compared with $16.7 million or $0.44 per share for the second quarter of 2006, and up 29% compared with $28.0 million or $0.62 per share for the first quarter of 2007.  Let me quickly summarize our results for the first six months of 2007. Total revenue for the first six months of 2007 was $254.5 million, up 55% compared with $164.3 million last year. Operating income for the first six months of 2007 was $79.4 million, up 72% compared with $46.2 million last year.  Operating income included $17.5 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first six months of 2007, compared with $11.6 million in 2006. Net income for the first six months of 2007 was $54.5 million or $1.41 a share, up 75% compared with $31.1 million or $0.82 per share.  Now turning our attention to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter of 2007 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $448 million, up $63 million from the previous quarter end. And $117 million from December 31, 2006. $11 million of the cash generated in the quarter and $20 million of the cash generated in this six-month period was associated with stock-purchase activities. The remaining cash generated is primarily related to operating activities.  Our accounts receivable balance increased to $105.6 million on June 30, 2007, from $90.5 million on March 31, 2007. The increase in accounts receivable is attributable to increased sales.  Our net inventory decreased to $24 million on June 30, 2007, from $26.3 million on March 31, 2007. Our inventory returns on June 30, 2007 of 7.4 times per year improved compared with 5.6 returns at the end of the previous quarter.  And with that, I would like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights. 
Aleks Cukic: Thank you Marshall. During the second quarter, we shipped 56 da Vinci systems. 44 systems in North America, 8 into Europe and 4 into rest-of-world markets. 55 of the 56 system shipments were da Vinci S Systems and one was the standard four-arm system. Of the 55 S Systems sold, 37 were High-definition or HD systems.  In addition, we sold eight HD upgrades to existing da Vinci S customers. The 56 systems sold during the quarter minus the 2 trade-ins brings to 656 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide—504 in North America, 108 in Europe and 44 in rest-of-world markets. 12 of the 56 systems sold during the quarter represented second, third or fourth system sales. Three hospitals Memorial Hermann at Houston, Clarian North in Indianapolis and Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Connecticut purchased third systems during the quarter. While Yonsei Medical Center in Seoul, Korea purchased their third and fourth systems.  Clinically we had another very good quarter, with strong sequential procedure growth across all major surgical specialties both US and internationally. Our gynecologic procedure business, paced by da Vinci hysterectomy, registered the largest sequential percentage growth for the quarter, followed by urology. Our cardiothoracic and general surgery procedure businesses, which are approximately the same size, showed strong steady sequential procedure growth. Ben will provide you with updated procedure guidance during his review.  During the quarter we had 42 da Vinci related clinical papers published within various peer-reviewed journals. And in June, we launched the da Vinci HD Vision system to international customers. We participated in 11 conferences within urology, gynecology, general surgery and cardiothoracic surgery, however I'll review highlights from only two, beginning with the American Urology Association or AUA.  Our AUA presence this year was exceptional. The program included 78 moderated da Vinci abstracts, 41 on DVP alone, along with three AUA sanctioned post-graduate robotic courses, five live da Vinci Telesurgery broadcasts and two AUA sanctioned robotic lunch programs. Our two da Vinci HD demo systems were running non-stop throughout the conference while our sales people were busy writing leads.  Also encouraging was the fact that there were 37 non-DVP moderated abstracts at this year's program which included da Vinci nephrectomy, radical prostatectomy, pyeloplasty, sacral colpopexy and various Pediatric Urology procedures.  The key observation from this year's AUA has to do with the procedure leverage DVP has established for us throughout the entire specialty of Urology and perhaps beyond. Five short years ago when DVP was in its infancy, there were a handful of urologists talking about it and almost no one presenting case data. At this year's AUA the Henry Ford Group, led by Dr. Manin Menon, presented their case data on a series of 2,632 patients. The series included patients with T2, T3 and T4 cancers with a reported overall positive margin rate of 13%. 13% compares very favorably to Henry Ford's 2003 British Journal of Urology Publication in which they reported a 23% overall positive margin rate in a series of 1,400 open prostatectomy patients.  The group also reported a postoperative inner course rate of 93% and men receiving The Veil of Aphrodite technique without any preoperative erectile dysfunction. On the same day the Ohio State Group led by Dr. V. Patel reported on their series of 1,300 consecutive DVPs and showed an average operating time of only 95 minutes. A one-day hospitalization with an overall margin rate of 11%, and only 4% in patients with organ-confined disease.  With large evidence-based patient series such as these becoming more common each quarter, it gives us as well as many of our customers the confidence to say that DVP is rapidly moving toward a standard of care for prostatectomy in the United States. However when you consider DVP adoption on a global scale, the penetration is significantly less.  We are also beginning to see our DVP momentum pull along a number of other urologic procedures. Examples, such as City of Hope Group presenting their initial 60 da Vinci radical prostatectomies, or a group out of Innsbruck, Austria reporting on their initial 26 da Vinci partial nephrectomies, or Tulane University Group presenting on their data of six sacral colpopexies, and so on. We've always believed that a heavy DVP focus with commensurate re-sourcing would ultimately be the most effective way for us to access the entire specialty of urology which now appears to be taking place.  This year was the first time we exhibited at the American College of Gynecology Conference or ACOG, which took place in San Diego. We were quite pleased with the level of da Vinci activity at this conference. On previous calls we highlighted our success at some of the specialty GYN conferences such as the Society of Gynecologic Oncology Conference or SGO, or the Association of Advance Gynecological Laparoscopy or AAGL, whereas ACOG is the predominant professional organization for the entire field of OBGYN.  In addition to the heavy test drive schedule for the HD system, our booth was filled with physicians listening to clinical lectures on da Vinci hysterectomy, myomectomy and sacral colpopexy. At the same ACOG was conducting da Vinci lectures and hands-on didactic sessions as part of their advance laparoscopic post-graduate course in which 120 surgeons participated. During the plenary session ACOG featured two live da Vinci hysterectomies, one for endometrial cancer broadcast from the University of North Carolina, and the second for benign pathology broadcast from the Mayo Clinic. The sessions were very well attended and enthusiasm was high.  Customer request for GYN case observation, training, case proctoring- which are all early indicators to the strength of the business- remains high. In summary we remain very bullish on our GYN opportunity.  That concludes my update and I’ll turn the time over to Ben. 
Ben Gong: Thank you, Aleks. As in previous earnings calls I’ll be providing our update or forecast on a GAAP reporting basis, including stock compensation expenses. I’ll also provide an estimate of the stock compensation expenses separately so that you can calculate meaningful comparisons that exclude these non-cash expenses.  We reported better than anticipated growth in revenue and profits in the second quarter and we expect to continue this momentum in the second half of the year, therefore we are increasing our previous guidance for revenue and profits for 2007. We have mentioned in the past that the primary driver for the company’s growth is the growth in procedures performed with da Vinci System. Today, our top two procedures are da Vinci Prostatectomy or DVP and da Vinci Hysterectomy or DVH.  At the beginning of the year we had given guidance that we expected the DVP growth this year to exceed 50%. Based on what we have experienced in the first half of the year, we now expect DVP growth for the year to exceed 65%. With regard to DVH, we have previously given guidance that we expected DVH growth this year to exceed 150%. We now expect DVH growth for the year to exceed 175%.  Now with regard to revenue, in our previous call we estimated our instrument and accessory revenues to grow between 65% and 70% over 2006. Based upon stronger procedure growth led by DVP and DVH, we now expect 2007 instrument and accessory revenue to grow between 70% and 75% over 2006.  Our systems sales were particularly strong in the second quarter, across new and existing customers and across domestic and international customers. We expect to have continued year-over-year growth in system unit placements this year.  We are forecasting systems revenue to grow between 30% and 35% over 2006, which is up from our previous forecast of 20% to 25%. The majority of this growth is resulting from an increase in system units, while part of this growth is also driven by higher average selling prices for systems.  Our system ASP was approximately $1.3 million for the second quarter and $1.25 million in the first quarter. For the balance of the year, we expect our system ASP to remain between $1.25 and $1.3 million. This is approximately $100,000 higher than our average ASP in 2006.  We expect service revenues to grow approximately 50% above 2006 levels, up from our previous forecast of 45%.  Overall, we now expect our total 2007 revenues to grow approximately 45% to 50% over 2006, compared to 40% previously forecast.  Please note that we typically have a seasonally softer third quarter as elective surgeries are often postponed during the summer months, and summer vacations often disrupt our customers’ buying patterns. Therefore, we expect total revenue in the third quarter to be about the same as our revenue in the second quarter; we should then see sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our strongest quarter of the year. With regard to gross profit margin, we have consistently maintained gross margins at around 67% over the past few quarters and we expect our gross margins to remain at approximately this rate for the remainder of the year.  Moving to operating expenses, there are number of factors which are driving our operating expenses higher than we previously forecast. First, higher revenues are driving higher sales commissions which are reflected in SG&A expense. We expect our SG&A expense to grow between 40% and 44% for the year.  In the R&D expense category, we'd stepped up our investment in internal projects as well as co-development projects with third-party corporate partners. Our co-development projects with third-parties are expected to increase our quarterly R&D expense by approximately $1.5 million per quarter starting in the third quarter.  In total, we expect our R&D expense for 2007 to be 48% to 52% higher than our total R&D expense for 2006. We expect our total operating expense for 2007 to be 41% to 45% higher than our total operating expense in 2006. These forecasts for gross margin and operating expense include the impact of FAS123R stock compensation expense.  Our second quarter operating income included $9.4 million of non-cash stock compensation expenses, allocated as follows: $1.5 million in cost of sales, $5.8 million in SG&A and $2 million in R&D. For the year, we expect the impact of FAS123R to be between $36 and $37 million with a percentage of allocation to P&L lines consistent with Q2.  Other income expense, which is mainly comprised of interest income is expected to be approximately $21 to $22 million for the year, compared with the $20 million estimate we had previously forecast due to higher cash balances.  With regard to income tax, we continue to expect GAAP tax rates of 39% for the remainder of the year. However, we expect our effective cash tax expense to be 15% to 20% for 2007. Regarding shares outstanding, we currently have 37.7 common shares outstanding. We also have approximately 33.7 million option shares outstanding. Depending upon our average stock price during the third quarter, a portion of the 3.7 million option shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation. For calculating EPS in Q3, we expect the share count to be between 38.7 million and 39 million shares.  That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the call to your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. At this time we will begin the question-and-answer portion of today's program. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. And our first question comes from Tao Levy or Levy I'm sorry go ahead with your question. 
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Close enough, it's Tao Levy. Hi guys. 
Gary Guthart: Hi Tao. 
Jerry McNamara: Hi Tao. 
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Congratulations, great numbers here. Just wanted to flush a couple of things out the very impressive system number. Anyway, you know, last quarter was a little bit different where versus our numbers, the system was a little bit softer yet utilization was really strong and then now you had a little bit of the reverse versus our numbers here in this quarter. Is that, like you've seen in years before where you have greater utilization drive system placement? Is that what we’ve seen this quarter versus the first quarter again? 
Jerry McNamara: Hey Tao, this is Jerry. Yeah, I just wanted to point out as you have suspected, we have experienced that increase in utilization within our installed base across all areas of the world and it’s being led primarily by the increase in GYN procedures and DVP procedures and as hospitals reach capacity with their da Vinci Systems, in many cases they evaluate the need for additional systems and that launches second or third systems sales as Aleks mentioned. But overall what we have seen is an expansion of robotics surgery programs in hospitals and it’s taking place at a very consistent and solid rate, so we are pretty pleased with that. 
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Great and maybe, could you flush out the whole sort of, any way to flush out sort of the number of systems or the percentage of systems that were purchased due to sort of our interesting gynecology versus urology? 
Jerry McNamara: That’s always a hard thing for us to do Tao, because as we’ve always said our focus is multiple specialty, and so to kind of draw a line to say this one was GYN or that one was urology is an imperfect science. What we can say is that since the approval of GYN, back in the May timeframe of 2005, we’ve seen a preponderance of second system placements and one can conclude that there is just not enough capacity in the hospitals that have multiple specialties seeking to use the system. So it continues to happen, but it would be hard for us to tell you exactly what percentage is due to this, but it's something we see continuing. 
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Okay, and then the last question, maybe for Gary and Jerry, maybe given your new roles at the company, maybe you could sort of talk about sort of the challenges and opportunities that you see for robotic surgery over the next several years, you know worldwide? I know it's quite a tough question, but any insight there would obviously be helpful for us as we try to see where this is going and again over the next several years? 
Jerry McNamara: Tao we’ve got a couple of hours. 
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Yeah. 
Jerry McNamara: Okay, Tao we are -- our challenges just to continue to drive the key procedure adoption, and I think Aleks did a really great job of pointing out that with our success in driving DVP and growing that procedure we gained tremendous leverage if you will for additional procedures in the same specialty, so we are not just moving a procedure but we are moving the specialty of urology. This is also what we are challenged with in gynecology, so simply put we are driving a procedure business and our customers are investing in robotics programs that are multi-specialty. 
Gary Guthart: I'll add something on the development side. I think the common theme for us on development is that we want to both enable new procedure as well as refine and improve the products for existing procedures and so we are all restructuring ourselves to do that. 
Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from Eli Kammerman. 
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: Thanks very much. First question is it looks like your average utilization is still solidly below three procedures per week per system over your installed base, so how do you reconcile that with the hospitals' need for a second system because they are bumping up against capacity ceilings? 
Ben Gong: Eli this is Ben. We definitely experienced growth in utilization during the second quarter over the first quarter; we've continued to see increased utilization on a quarterly basis barely steadily over the last year, say 10 quarters. Now, keep in mind that our metric of an average of between two and three procedures per week and it still is in that range, is an average and so we've mentioned we have a number of people that are over five procedures a week, which tends to be a bit of a point where they have trouble scheduling cases and then needing to buy additional systems and at the same time you might have newer users that are less than two procedures a week. So, the key here is that the utilization continues to grow on average and that means everyone's using their systems more. 
Gary Guthart: The other point is we are constantly bringing in new customers right? We've got 56 new systems, of those 44 were new customers and those ramp up. They take some time to ramp up, so we are always constant alluding on the low-end and growing on the top end. 
Jerry McNamara: And I think one more piece of information that is also helpful is that we have 504 systems in the United -- in North America and we have 63 customers or roughly 63 customers in North America that have more than one system. So we have a total of 420 different centers of which 63 have more than one system. In other words, 15% of the U.S. base of hospitals has more than one system and so when you add a second system to let’s say a hospital that's doing 300 or 400 procedures per year, their average gets cut in half and even despite that we are continuing to grow the overall metric and so I think it’s important to recognize it’s not exactly a linear algorithm because there are a lot of moving parts here. The bottom line is that we have a lot of people that are requiring second systems and we are pleased to sell them. 
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And my next question is in the area of OB/GYN could you give us some rough idea of what fraction of procedures are for oncology-related surgeries and what fraction are for other? 
Jerry McNamara: You know, what we are able to track pretty clearly is the type of surgeon that's actually performing the operation- in other words, the GYN oncologist or a non-oncologist. What is less of a perfect science is exactly the pathology, but it's pretty clear that the GYN oncology practice is primarily gynecologic procedures. But I can say at this point again without having an exact breakdown that we are tracking both sides and both sides are tracking very nicely, both complex, benign as well as oncologic, and we see that obviously based on our up guidance continuing to grow very strongly. 
Eli Kammerman - Cowen and Company: Alright. Thanks very much. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question or comment comes from Tim Nelson, Piper Jaffray. 
Tim Nelson - Piper Jaffray: Hi guys, wonderful quarter. The most common question I get from my clients and (inaudible) is how much longer can a radical prostatectomy DVP procedure grow? Can you tell on your penetration rate and where you think it tops out and maybe some time as to where you think the market strategy is now, I know it's growing relative at expense of some other procedures? 
Gary Guthart: Well, Tim you just hit two pieces- that again our role is very difficult for us to quantify, I mean, I am going to add a third- US versus all US. So, when you look at all three of those pieces it's hard for us to kind of answer it in the way that you formed it, where it's going to tap out. I think if you look at the way we reported it we'd given a fixed approximation of 90,000 procedures in United States and we'd sort of based everything off of that, but when you look at it on a global basis, it’s a significantly larger number.  When you look at the moving parts which you accurately called out between brachytherapy, external beam radiation, watchful waiting, etcetera. Unfortunately, that’s lagging numbers, so we really don’t know what that translates into now. So, as a result, we feel very strongly that we can give with confidence an up guidance of a 65% annual growth rate, taking it up from 50% and that’s about as clear as we can go. 
Lonnie Smith: I guess the other comment, longer term I'd make is that, we do track procedures against a new diagnosis and that continues to grow and if you look at it by state there are some states that are highly penetrated and some of that are not yet. And we are seeing growth in all of them, even the most highly penetrated states. And so that’s encouraging, I think also is that, if you look at, if you’re talking about the prostatectomy, but there are multiple other procedures where we are now deserving a clear adoption curve. It's a very high correlation factor. So, I think we don’t plan to stop with prostatectomy, we are following with gynecology and as Jerry pointed out, I think it’s important that we started with one re-procedure within a group and pretty soon it expands in that specialty to other procedures. And so, where we bring value and as Jerry pointed out, we continue to try to drive the value add that we bring to existing procedures, as well as the value add we bring to new procedures. 
Tim Nelson - Piper Jaffray: Great. On the R&D front, you talked about some co-development agreements. Can you comment on any new products that can add over the balance of the year that you are excited about on the instrumentation side, and if any losing products may help increase that ASP per procedure? 
Lonnie Smith: Well, we don't announce products before the ratio, so we'll announce those as they come ready. I will say that we are accelerating our R&D activities in several areas including investments in imaging technologies of robotics, software instruments and applied research. In addition, we've stepped up our technical partnerships with outside third parties. I'll tell you also we are pleased with the progress and the pace of our R&D teams to-date, and as new products come out we'll share that with you at that time. 
Jerry McNamara: And to the other side, you asked about ASPs and regarding that ASPs will stay around the same range that we've see them in the first half of the year. This is for system sales obviously and it's going to be driven by things like product mix and geographic mix as it has in the past. 
Tim Nelson - Piper Jaffray: Okay. I was thinking more about the instrumentation, the revenue per procedure on instrumentation side, it has been flat for a long, long time. I was just wondering if you ever can break out of that range? 
Gary Guthart: And if you are driving the adoption, we are not necessarily driving to increase or striving to increase the cost for procedure to our customers. So that is not part of our strategy, our strategy is penetration, system placement and procedure adoption. 
Jerry McNamara: And I think just on top of that, we are conscious of the way our customers evaluate their cost and as they are reimbursed on a per case basis it's important for us to really recognize the way their business is structured, so I wouldn't think of that as just one that we could just continue to grow and grow through technology 
Tim Nelson - Piper Jaffray: Okay, and then a final question is back on the installed base, it's sort of about utilization rate. Do you have anything [right on] the numbers of system out there that are actually idle that don’t get used much and do you see any trends as procedures grow, utilization grows, that those older systems that maybe still out of use or getting reused or getting refurbished to get more active? 
Jerry McNamara: Tim that's exactly what happens, as the success of robotic surgery and the increased adoption of prostatectomy and da Vinci Hysterectomy grows, systems that were not optimized become busier and also our field sales teams are not selling robots at this point in time. They are selling robotic surgery programs that bring the benefits of the technology to patients in multi-specialty. So, this enables us to take systems that might have been laggards or stalled systems and move them to the active state and we do that very proactively. 
Tim Nelson - Piper Jaffray: Is that part of the trade-in program that sort of (inaudible) that going? 
Jerry McNamara: No, Tim that's not part of the training program. 
Tim Nelson - Piper Jaffray: Okay, all right thanks. 
Jerry McNamara: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Ritchie, Wachovia. 
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I got a couple of quick questions for you. The first one is do you have a split on the international and OUS revenues? 
Gary Guthart: Yeah, it's been tracking pretty consistently in the 80% to 85% domestic, and that means 15% to 20% international, and it didn’t change significantly this quarter versus previous quarters. 
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Okay, that's great. More on the procedural side, have you guys been tracking residency programs that are training their residence on the system and exposing it to them? 
Gary Guthart: I don’t think that is an absolute metric we track. I can say anecdotally that the awareness of robotic surgery in, starting if you were a little above up the food chain in other words fellowship programs down into residency programs starting with senior residence fourth year, third year, second year, etcetera. Anecdotally I can tell you that there is more exposure there, but in terms of a number or some form of a metric I can't give you one. 
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Okay. I think that was just something that we noticed the SGO that there were a couple of posters about that, I was just curious if that was, when is it happening? 
Gary Guthart: Yeah it's happening but it's just a hard one to -- kind of to keep real time. 
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Okay. The five procedures through weak metric you kind of mentioned- when you are talking about that, are you talking about a multi-specialty hospital or is it that the hospital that's using it for one specialty, because that seems kind of low for a hospital that would be a straight urology hospital? 
Gary Guthart: Yeah. That's a good point and I will take the opportunity to repeat some of the concepts from before. When a system is being shared among multiple specialties we find that the capacity of the system is lower than when it is fully dedicated to one specialty because it's just harder to schedule across different specialties. And so we've said that when there is sharing among different specialties, we've seen people buy second systems when they would hit somewhere in the order of 250 procedures a year, whereas we would see people who are exclusively in urology get up to 400 procedures per year on the system before they would buy their next system. 
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Okay. And how many of the hospitals are presently multi-system hospitals? 
Gary Guthart: We have 71 worldwide with 63 in North America and the breakdown to just give you the specifics on how many have per, I should say we have six hospitals that have four da Vinci's. We have 15 hospitals that have three and we have approximately 50 that have two. 
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Okay, great and then my last question is in terms of the partnerships that you’re looking at, are these for specific specialties such as general cardio OBGYN or is it more just towards specific type of technologies? 
Jerry McNamara: It tends to be more broad than single and -- I guess I have to say it really depends on the partnership as well. If there is one and it is a particularly good fit then we will pursue it for a single specialty, but most of them are broader than a single. 
Vincent Ritchie - Wachovia: Okay, great, thanks for taking my questions. 
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from Rick Wise, Bear Stearns. 
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: Good afternoon everybody and truly congratulations on a terrific quarter. A couple of things, clearly we saw a lot of operating leverage this quarter with operating expenses growing well below the sales rate and Ben, you’ve given us some very clear-cut and excellent guidance going forward, but just in general as we think about whether it’s a second half or the next two years, should we expect to see this kind of significant operating leverage too just in a general way as we look out to the future? 
Lonnie Smith: Rick, let me make sure of that, I think that's a -- we do manage the business on a fixed and variable basis and so we do understand operating leverage well. Our longer term goal is to bring those more in line, not -- because we are investing in R&D and a lot of other areas. 
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: I’m sorry, Lonnie more in line meaning -- 
Lonnie Smith: It is more in line with sales growth. 
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: So that -- it would be equivalent? 
Lonnie Smith: Yeah, so that would be more equivalent, I think that when we have -- literally when we have this kind of growth, we -- it outpaces our ability to build the infrastructure. Now, we are all just trying to get (inaudible) -- we are not going to have a culture here where we build infrastructure faster and we built sales that just won't happen, so there is probably some leverage but I would not factor into a model a lot of operating leverage going forward we'll be investing infrastructure because we are investing in the future, I mean, we are still in the very, very early stages of this market and this technology and where it can go and we want to remain the leader, so we will continue to invest heavily to do so. 
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: Okay, I sort of cut-off from mid -- so I apologize if I am asking a question that’s been asked just tell me if it has. First quarter units were less than we expected, second quarter a little more and I know Lonnie how finer you are of focusing on quarters, it's not so much that question as is this the kind of variation we should expect to see on sort of randomly much stronger randomly a little less, with continued strong procedure growth, again just in a directional kind of way? 
Lonnie Smith: I suspect there will be a variability in that and part of it is self-induced to be fair, in terms of our ability to hire in from our clinical sales organization as well as our various sales managers who sell the systems, but I think that we will have variability and we know that there is seasonality to the capital purchase cycle. We'd mentioned that before we always see that usually on a capital side, the second and fourth quarters are the strongest or we see a stronger ever since I suppose that sometimes because of different budgetary cycles there are and procedures follow more of a different cycle based upon patients and timing and vacations and lot of other things. So, I think that there's variability there that is driven by just the structure of our healthcare system and individual's personal priorities. 
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: Okay, and let me ask a really dumb question related to that. Are we now in a sort of 50 to 60 kind of unit range now, or is that just where we are given the opportunities, new procedures? I am not looking for specific forecast but more, have we kicked up to a new high level for going forward? 
Lonnie Smith: Yeah, Rick for this yeah you are probably in the right range. The guidance that we'd given for system revenue growth probably hovers in that range. 
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: And, last maybe a question to ask, when we went into the SGO meeting docs were -- I have asked you this before, I ask for just an update on this, docs were hollering the adoption hurdle (inaudible) were staff training issues. Maybe you could give us a little more color on what's going on and has that changed and evolved and maybe our docs perception is changing about the amount of time it might take to get your staffs up and running? Thanks. 
Aleks Cukic: When you were referring to staff, I'll maybe just answer in two ways. One, is if you mean the hospital staff, nursing, assistance and so on and so forth, we take a great deal of responsibility for that training and our ability to deliver high quality training on a scalable level has been pretty strong to this point but I don’t think in my mind at least that, that is going to be a limiting element to the growth of the business. Now, if you are talking about staff in terms of other surgeons on the hospital staff, that takes on a little different complexion and that one certainly requires the help of different physician peers and different training centers and so on and so forth. While it is true that that could be a limiting factor, I think we are managing it very well and are not expecting it to slow it down. 
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: Okay. And did I miss, did you give a service revenue, did I miss that number when we cut our again our phones cut up here? 
Gary Guthart: Yeah. The growth in service revenue for the year is going to be 50% year-over-year. 
Rick Wise - Bear Stearns: Okay. Thanks a lot. 
Gary Guthart: Thank you. We have time for one more question. 
Operator: Thank you. And that final question will come from Mark Richter, Jefferies & Company. 
Mark Richter - Jefferies & Company: Thanks guys and good quarter. First question as most of them might have been answered, I've got a couple of quick ones. First one, how was the procedure of volume growth in the quarter for general surgical procedures? Can you comment specifically on bariatric surgery? And then maybe cardiothoracic market and how that's evolving? 
Gary Guthart: Yeah. I think if you look at cardiothoracic and general surgery the growth rates were roughly the same for the quarter, both had nice strong growth specifically within cardiac. As we've talked about in the past our target areas are mitral valve repair and revascularization. During the quarter, we did very well with those procedures and probably most notable in there were some of the new centers that are beginning to perform mitral valve repair, namely the Cleveland Clinic, which as probably most of you know is the preeminent cardiac center, one of the preeminent cardiac centers anywhere in the world with enormous valve practice. So, they are up and running and doing very well.  Within bariatric again, as we've sort of said in the past, we see that being a nice steady growth driver, but there isn’t anything unusual about it to really report on, so I think I would classify both of those as good, solid, steady growth. 
Mark Richter - Jefferies & Company: Okay, perfect and then I don’t and I apologize if I missed this, I did walk out of my office for a quick second, but did you comment on DVP penetration for the quarter and where you stand now? 
Jerry McNamara: Well, what we’ve said earlier was that we’ve grown the guidance for the remainder of the year to be taking it up from 50% growth to 65% growth, but we did not give a percentage or a penetration number, but rather a growth target for the year. 
Mark Richter - Jefferies & Company: And just curious why you are not giving penetration numbers now whereas you have in the past? 
Jerry McNamara: Well, we actually got away from that at the end of the fourth quarter of 2006, so we have not given it in 2007, and the reason is that there are just too many moving targets and what we’ve heard from a number of people is that global growth rate is probably of more value to modeling, etcetera than is some type of penetration, especially with the market changing within radiation therapy, prostatectomy, watchful waiting and so on. So we made that change earlier this year and I think it’s one that we will continue with. 
Mark Richter - Jefferies & Company: Okay, perfect and the last question is as obviously your cash balance continues to build, what do you plan on doing with your cash? Thanks. 
Lonnie Smith: Well, that’s one of my favorite questions. The fact is that we are in, this is a quickly evolving market there, so a lot of technology that’s being developed and procedures that we think are opportunities and the opportunities and the generation of cash do not always perfectly match in terms of timing and so what we -- we are essentially building our cash and we will invest it as we find opportunities for technology and things that support robotic surgery, I mean we are not going to go off and buy another company because we think that's interesting; we are going to be focused on those investments that will drive the penetration of robotic surgery and the adoption course for the procedures we are focused on. So we think cash is good and we will spend it appropriately, we've -- where we find opportunities we won't get cash happy, not burning a hole in our pocket at this point of time. 
Mark Richter - Jefferies & Company: Great thanks. 
Lonnie Smith: That was our last question, as I said last quarter while we focused on the financial metrics such as revenues and profits, cash flow during these conference calls our organizational focus is on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma, we believe that adoption is procedure-specific and patient-driven. It is our goal to help the surgeon deliver a significant shift and value to the patient and we define patient value as efficacy of the procedure divided by its invasiveness. Dr. Lee [Sevak] who is the Chief of Cardiac Surgery at Sacred Heart in Spokane, Washington told us last week that the da Vinci system had enabled him to repair the mitral valves of two patients who could not tolerate a sternonomy or minotarconmy due to severe bone disease.  One of these was a 49-year-old with osteogenesis so severe that he cracked his ribs by merely coughing. Dr. Sevak repaired the man's mitral valve with the da Vinci without complications and he was released from the hospital two days post-surgery. The other patient was a 63-year-old with severe mitral valve disease, osteoporosis and scoliosis and he was released three days post-surgery. Both men are doing well and have been given a reprieve from the long-term sentence of congestive heart failure. But Dr. Sevak also said that he was no longer a customer only. His wife recently had a hysterectomy performed with the da Vinci system. She went kayaking four days after surgery and played nine holes of golf six days post-surgery. You see that was in sharp contrast to a woman who was supposed to play in a golf tournament with one of his partners and cancelled because she had a cyst hysterectomy six weeks prior to the tournament and still did not fell well enough to play. Patients like Dr. Sevak's wife become our strongest advocates for surgery with the da Vinci system. So, that is the key to our success.  In closing, I assure you we remain committed to focusing on the vital few things that would really make a difference and we strive to take surgery beyond the limits of human hands. That concludes today's call, we thank you for your participation and support in this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking to you again in three months.
