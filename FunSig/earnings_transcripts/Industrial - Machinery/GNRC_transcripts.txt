===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Generac Holdings, Inc., First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Kris Rosemann. You may begin.
Kris Rosemann: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2025 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer, and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Kris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, primarily driven by strong shipments of home standby generators during the period. Residential energy technology sales also outperformed, as ecobee had another great quarter, and shipments of energy storage shipments systems also exceeded our prior forecast. Additionally, continued strong gross margins were the primary driver of adjusted EBITDA coming in well ahead of our prior expectations for the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, overall net sales increased 6% to $942 million for the quarter. Residential product sales were 15% higher than the prior year, driven by strong growth in shipments of home standby generators and energy technology solutions. C&I product sales declined 5% year-over-year, with increases in the domestic telecom and industrial distributor channels more than offset by softness in other C&I end markets. Favorable sales mix and lower input costs resulted in continued gross margin expansion of nearly 400 basis points from the prior year to 39.5%, which is our highest first quarter gross margin level since 2021, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins increasing to nearly 16% for the quarter. While the first quarter marked a strong start to the year, the dynamic and uncertain nature of tariffs and other federal policy actions has introduced a wider range of potential outcomes for our end markets in 2025. As York will discuss in more detail, we are widening our guidance ranges for the year to reflect the potential impact of more restrictive trade policy on consumer spending. As disclosed in our press release, our updated outlook assumes that current tariff levels hold for the remainder of the year, with tariffs on Chinese imports at 145%, steel and aluminum tariffs at 25%, and all other reciprocal tariffs at 10%, including the assumption that these reciprocal tariffs continue beyond the current 90-day pause. While we anticipate a more cautious economic environment around the consumer, our updated guidance assumes the U.S. economy will avoid a full recession during 2025. At today's tariff levels and reflecting our current global supply chain, we expect our product costs will increase in the second half of 2025 by approximately $125 million prior to any mitigation efforts. In response to these anticipated higher costs, we have raised prices across a wide range of products, and we expect that our price actions will fully offset the cost of tariffs on dollar terms. Additionally, we are executing on a number of supply chain and other cost reduction initiatives that will help to further offset the impact of tariffs and other cost increases over the next several quarters. Now discussing our first quarter results in more detail, home standby shipments increased at a mid-teens rate from the prior year as we continued to execute on the strong demand from the elevated power outage environment that occurred in the second half of 2024. Power outage hours during the first quarter were above the long-term baseline average, primarily driven by the wildfires in Southern California, which is a growing but underdeveloped market for home standby generators. As a result, home consultations were lighter than expected relative to the overall outage hours in the quarter, as the IHC to outage hour ratio in California is below the ratio we have historically seen in other, more mature regions. Penetration rates for home standby generators in California are less than 2%, and our sales and marketing teams are focused on continuing to develop this important market through increased awareness for our products as well as further expanding our distribution in the state. As expected, close rates remained under pressure in the quarter as a result of the elevated demand experienced in the second half of last year relative to our sales and installation capacity. In addition to increased focus on optimizing our marketing investments during 2025 to further drive end customer demand for our products, we will continue to invest in lead optimization, dealer development and expansion, consumer engagement, and further penetration of home standby finance offerings to help support longer-term close rate improvements. We ended the first quarter with more than 9,200 residential dealers in our network, growing slightly from the prior quarter and representing an increase of more than 400 dealers over the prior year. The significant growth in dealer count over the last 12 months is an important element of our ability to support a new and higher baseline level of consumer awareness for the home standby category by adding more sales, installation, and service capacity to our distribution network. Similarly, the continued success of our Aligned Contractor Program, targeting electrical contractors that purchase our products through wholesale distribution, has provided an additional channel for us to further engage and align with a broader set of contractors that are selling and installing our products. Activations or installations of home standby generators increased during the first quarter as compared to the prior year, with particular strength in regions that have recently been impacted by elevated power outage activity, including the southeast, south-central, and west regions. Growth in activations continued early in the 2nd Quarter, with similar regional trends experienced here in the month of April. Importantly, our next generation home standby lineup is on track for the previously announced second half 2025 launch, representing the most comprehensive platform update for the product category in more than a decade. These new products will deliver numerous value-added benefits for homeowners and our channel partners relative to the current product line. For homeowners, this includes a lower total cost of ownership, with improved fuel efficiency, quieter operation, and lower overall installation and maintenance costs. The new product line also includes the industry's highest output air-cooled home standby generator at 28 kilowatts, improving affordability on a per-kilowatt basis as backup power needs grow in response to increased residential electrification trends. For our channel partners, the new home standby lineup offers more efficient installation and service processes, including faster commissioning times and improved remote diagnostics, ultimately enabling their businesses to provide greater uptime for customers while also saving time and money. Additionally, the transition to our next generation home standby generator platform has provided our operations and supply chain teams with an opportunity to implement more automation in our manufacturing processes and further increase the resiliency and diversity of our supply chain. Despite the projected impact of tariffs on the macroeconomic environment, we continue to anticipate growth in home standby generator sales for 2025, driven by an increase in activations during the first half of the year and higher pricing beginning in the second quarter. We also expect the category to hold the new and higher baseline of demand that was achieved following the multiple major power outage events in the second half of 2024. Additionally, we will continue to execute on our initiatives to support close rates, dealer effectiveness, and marketing optimization while also working on various manufacturing and sourcing initiatives related to the new product launch as well as the mitigation efforts around tariffs. Now moving to our residential energy technology solutions, which exceeded our expectations during the quarter as a result of continued strong momentum at ecobee and the further execution of the Department of Energy program in Puerto Rico for our energy storage solutions. The team at ecobee continues to perform very well, delivering robust sales growth during the quarter and exceptional gross margin improvement compared to the prior year with higher shipments across channels, most notably to our retail and pro-channel partners. We believe ecobee's recently introduced lower-cost smart thermostat offering will further drive market share gains by extending the product line into the faster-growing value segment of the market. ecobee's connected homes count also continues to grow rapidly, having increased approximately 17% from the prior year, along with improving service attach rates and related recurring revenue. Shipments of energy storage systems increased at a significant rate during the quarter as we continue to execute on the DOE program in Puerto Rico. We also began taking our first orders earlier this month for PWRcell 2, our next-generation energy storage system, and we remain on track for our first shipments of these new systems later in the second quarter. Our recent discussions with channel partners about the new platform have been very encouraging, and we have received positive feedback on our unique approach to creating a residential energy ecosystem, providing unrivaled capabilities for homeowners to generate, store, monitor, and manage their own power. We believe our expertise in building and developing distribution, our capabilities in direct-to-consumer marketing, the strength of our brand, and our financial stability combined with our differentiated ecosystem of solutions, including ecobee smart thermostats, PWRcell 2 energy storage devices, electric vehicle chargers, and home standby generators, creates an incredibly unique value proposition for both installers and end customers. Our prior expectation for residential energy technology sales in the range of 300 million to 400 million for the full year 2025 is unchanged, given our current assumptions that the Department of Energy program in Puerto Rico continues as planned, and the relevant portions of the Inflation Reduction Act, including the investment tax credit for homeowners, remain intact. We also continue to anticipate ecobee will achieve profitability during the full-year period. Additionally, we believe that our residential energy storage systems will be minimally impacted by tariffs during 2025, given our current inventory levels. We remain committed to investing in this strategically important area of our business, and believe that the megatrends around lower power quality and rising power prices will provide growing incentives for homeowners to seek out solutions that help to both protect and lower the cost of their electricity over a longer-term horizon. For our commercial and industrial products during the quarter, sales decreased by 5% on a year-over-year basis, as growth in shipments to our domestic telecom and industrial distributor customers was more than offset by softness in domestic rental, beyond standby, and certain international end markets. Shipments to our domestic and industrial distributors grew again during the quarter, as we continued to reduce our lead times for C&I products, and the channel also experienced improved quoting activity and project win rates on a year-over-year basis. Although we are encouraged by the resilience of this end market, given recent trends in these leading indicators, we continue to expect that full-year sales for industrial distributors will be softer compared to the prior year, as a result of entering 2025 with a lower backlog. Sales to national telecom customers increased at a significant rate on a year-over-year basis during the first quarter, and we continue to expect a return to growth in this channel for the full year. The telecom market represents an important long-term growth opportunity for Generac, given the secular trend around expanding global tower network hub installations and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications that require much higher power reliability. As expected, shipments to our national and independent rental equipment customers in the first quarter declined from the prior year, driven by reduced capital spending from these accounts in our product categories. Although we continue to expect this channel to be softer throughout the year, we believe that this end market has further runway for growth longer term, as infrastructure-related projects continue to build out over time. Additionally, our effort to expand our product line into larger megawatt diesel generators remains on track, as we formally began taking orders for these products earlier this month and expect initial shipments to begin later in the year. We have experienced strong early indications of interest from prospective customers in the data center market that are seeking a reliable partner with more competitive lead times for emergency backup power gensets. We believe that we are well positioned to take share in this market over time, given our unique focus, which allows us to provide customized sales, engineering, and aftermarket experiences, while also providing data center customers with a nationwide service network to ensure greater uptime for these critical applications. Internationally, core total sales increased approximately 5% on a year-over-year basis during the first quarter, driven by strength in residential product shipments in Latin America and higher inter-segment sales to the U.S. market. Although international C&I product sales declined from the prior year, we experienced continued positive order momentum in the quarter, which we believe supports our expectation of improved top-line performance in our international segment over the remainder of the year. We are also executing on a growing pipeline of data center opportunities internationally, with initial shipments of our new large megawatt generators expected in the second half of this year. In closing this morning, our first quarter results reflect strong performance in our residential product categories, given the benefit from elevated outage activity in 2024 and increasing momentum in our energy technology solutions. As economic uncertainty grows, we will continue to rely on our core corporate value of agility as we react to the rapidly evolving trade policy situation. We have deep expertise across our engineering, supply chain, and operations teams, and they will be focused on the execution of impactful opportunities to optimize our cost structure and position our supply chain to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs. Importantly, the megatrends of lower power quality and higher power prices that support our longer-term growth expectations remain firmly intact, and we are confident that our Powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy is the correct approach for Generac to help homeowners, businesses, and institutions solve these challenges. And now I'll turn the call over to York to provide further details on our first quarter results and our updated outlook for 2025. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at first quarter 2025 results in more detail, net sales during the quarter increased 6% to $942 million, as compared to $889 million in the prior year of first quarter. The net effect of acquisitions and foreign currency had a slight favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the first quarter by product class, residential product sales increased 15% to $494 million, as compared to $429 million in the prior year. As discussed, growth in residential product sales was driven by a strong increase in shipments of home standby generators as we executed on the continued higher demand created by above-average power outage activity in the second half of 2024. In addition, growth in shipments of both PWRcell energy storage systems and ecobee products contributed to this strong year-over-year growth. Commercial and industrial product sales for the first quarter of 2025 declined 5% to $337 million, as compared to $354 million in the prior year. Modest contributions from acquisitions were offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency, resulting in a net neutral impact on sales growth during the quarter. The core sales decline was driven by softness in certain international end markets, as well as a decrease in sales to national rental accounts and other direct customers for beyond standby applications, partially offset by growth in shipments to domestic telecom and industrial distributor customers. Net sales to the other products and services category increased approximately 4% to $111 million, as compared to $106 million in the first quarter of 2024. Core sales increased approximately 1%, primarily due to growth in aftermarket service parts, connectivity, subscription sales, and international services revenue. Gross profit margin was strong at 39.5%, compared to 35.6% in the prior year first quarter, as a result of favorable sales mix, given the relative strength of home standby sales and the realization of lower input costs. Operating expenses increased 39 million, or 16%, as compared to the first quarter of 2024. This increase was primarily driven by increased employee costs to support future growth across the business, additional marketing spend to drive incremental product awareness, and ongoing operating expenses related to recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $150 million, or 15.9% of net sales in the first quarter, as compared to $127 million, or 14.3% of net sales in the prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 9% to $782 million in the quarter, as compared to $720 million in the prior year, including approximately 2% sales growth contribution from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $123 million, representing 15.7% of total sales, as compared to $99 million in the prior year, or 13.8%. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased slightly to $186 million in the quarter, as compared to $187 million in the prior quarter, including an approximate 5% sales growth headwind from foreign currency, resulting in approximately plus 5% core total sales growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $27 million, or 14.6% of total sales, as compared to $28 million, or 15% in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2025 on a consolidated basis, as disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $44 million, as compared to $26 million for the first quarter of 2024. Our interest expense declined from $23.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 to $17.1 million in the current year period, as a result of lower outstanding borrowings and lower interest rates relative to prior year. GAAP income taxes during the current year fourth quarter were $14.2 million, or an effective tax rate of 24.3%, as compared to $12 million, or an effective tax rate of 31.2% for the prior year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by certain unfavorable discrete tax items in the prior year period that did not repeat in the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.73 in the first quarter of 2025, compared to $0.39 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $75 million in the current year quarter, or $1.26 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $53 million in the prior year, or $0.88 per share. Cash flow from operations was $58 million, as compared to $112 million in the prior year first quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $27 million, as compared to $85 million in the same quarter last year. The change in free cash flow was primarily driven by an increase in working capital during the current year quarter, which included the replenishment of home standby and portable generator finished good inventories, partially offset by higher operating earnings. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.3 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter of 1.6x on an as-reported basis, which is within our targeted gross debt leverage range of 1x to 2x adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 717,000 shares of our common stock during the quarter for $97 million. There is still $250 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of the first quarter. Moving forward, we will continue to operate within our disciplined and balanced capital allocation framework as we evaluate future shareholder value-enhancing opportunities over the long term. With that, I will now provide further comments on our updated outlook for 2025. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are updating our outlook to reflect a broader range of potential outcomes for our business, resulting from higher tariff levels, uncertain government policy actions, and their related impact on the markets that we serve. While we are maintaining the high end of our guidance ranges for net sales growth and adjusted EBITDA margin, we are reducing the lower end of these ranges to consider the potential impact of a softer economic environment. This guidance includes the following important assumptions. We are assuming that current tariff levels that are in effect today stay in place for the remainder of the year. This includes 145% tariff levels for China, 10% reciprocal tariffs for all of the countries, and the USMCA still qualifies. In addition, we are assuming that government policy around clean energy remains materially intact during the year. This would include sustaining the investment tax credit as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as continued federal support of our Department of Energy program in Puerto Rico. We are also assuming interest rates continue to remain at elevated levels, resulting in more cautious consumer spending trends through the year, but not falling into recessionary conditions during 2025. Finally, consistent with our historical approach, this outlook assumes a level of power outage activity during the year in line with the longer term baseline average and does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year, such as a major land hurricane or major winter storm. Considering these factors, we now expect a consolidated net sales for the full year to increase between 0%-7% compared to the prior year, which includes an approximate 1% favorable impact from the combination of foreign currency and acquisitions. This compares to our previous guidance of 3%-7% net sales growth over the prior year, as we expect tariff-related price increases to potentially be more than offset by lower shipment volumes. Specifically for the second quarter, we project net sales growth in the low single-digit range driven by modest year-over-year growth in residential product sales and approximately flat C&I product sales as compared to the prior year. This results in a second half sales weighting of nearly 56% of full year sales and is expected to be more level-loaded throughout the third and fourth quarters. Looking at our updated gross margin expectations for the full year 2025, we now expect gross margin percent to be approximately flat with full year 2024 levels in the 39% range. This is only a slight decline from our prior expectation for gross margin percent to approach 40% for the full year 2025. Given the incremental macroeconomic uncertainty, we are also proactively addressing potentially lower shipment volumes with targeted operating expense reductions relative to our prior forecast. These broad-based actions are expected to hold our full year 2025 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales approximately in line with previous expectations. Turning to our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations for the full year 2025, we have widened our guidance range to approximately 17%-19% compared to our previous guidance range of 18%-19%, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of reduced operating leverage on potentially lower shipment volumes. Importantly, the estimated impact of higher tariffs is expected to be fully offset by pricing actions and supply chain initiatives. Specifically for the second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to decline slightly compared to the first quarter 2025 run rate before sequentially improving to nearly 20% for the second half of the year, given the projected significant operating expense leverage on seasonally higher sales volumes. As is our normal practice, we are also providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2025. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add back items should be reflected net of tax using our expected effective tax rate. For 2025, our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 24.5% to 25%, a slight increase from our prior guidance of 24% to 24.5%. We continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $74 million to $78 million for the full year 2025, assuming no additional term loan principal prepayments during the year. This is a significant decline for 2024 levels due to a decrease in outstanding borrowings and the full year impact of lower SOFR interest rates. Our capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year, in line with our historical levels as we continue to invest in incremental capacity and execute other projects to support future growth expectations. Depreciation expense is now forecast to be approximately $90 million in 2025, and GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2025 is now expected to be approximately $100 million during the year. Stock compensation expense is still expected to be between $53 million to $57 million for the year. Operating and free cash flow generation is expected to be disproportionately weighted toward the second half of the year in 2025, as we expect to replenish home standby and portable finished good inventory levels during the first half of 2025. As a result, for the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion from adjusted net income to be between 70% to 90%. This is a wider range compared to our previous guidance of 80% to 90% due to a projected larger use of cash for inventory as a result of higher tariffs during the year. As a result of our first quarter share repurchases, our full year weighted average diluted share count is now expected to decrease modestly to approximately 59.5 million shares as compared to 60.3 million shares in 2024. Finally, this 2025 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value during the year. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens.
Tommy Moll: Aaron, I wanted to ask about the new product launches in C&I for the data center and market. You put out a press release earlier this month with a lot of product details, so my question is really in two parts. One, just if there's anything on the product design you want to make sure to highlight for us. And then, relatedly, you mentioned the ability to service this installed base one day with the Nationwide Service Network. I just want to make sure the go-to-market here is perhaps similar to your telco sales, so a direct sale, but then leveraging the service and aftermarket through your dealers. If that's an incorrect understanding, please let me know. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Tommy. So, yes, super excited about our data center product line, our large megawatt diesel lineup. Data centers, obviously, are our prime target, also though our existing customers, as we've talked before, kind of the existing end markets we serve from municipalities to manufacturing, distribution, healthcare, they all require larger blocks of backup power as well. So we feel like that's a part of the market that we haven't served historically, so we're going to be able to do that. As it relates to data centers, to take the second question first, Tommy, with data centers, the comment about the Nationwide Service Network, your assumption is exactly correct. We're going to ride on the back of what we've built for direct sales to our telecommunications customers primarily. That's a network we've built over the last 40 years. It's a combination of technicians with our industrial distributor customers, as well as our own IDCs, our own company stores. And so with that asset, we're going to be able to leverage that to serve on a coast-to-coast basis the direct sales of data center products. Now, outside of that, for other applications outside of data centers for those larger products, we'll service those products in a similar fashion to the way we take care of products that we sell through those other applications, which is primarily through our industrial distributor channel. They generally do that. We will occasionally jump in if we need to, it's not unusual for us to, we've got great resources here, even in Waukesha, Wisconsin, we can put somebody on a plane and they can be anywhere in the U.S. in less than four hours and be on the ground to get something up and running if there's a problem or to assist a customer or an end operator or a distributor with that. As far as the product itself is concerned, I think what I would call out, we made a little bit of a reference to it in our prepared remarks. But, one of the hallmarks that we have as a company here in our C&I product space is our ability to customize, that is something that we've brought to the market and really differentiates Generac. I think there's, in our business, there's a couple of different models that are deployed. We are a true Genset manufacturer here. Others might just be assemblers and even others might be building a base product and then sending it out to distribution partners or third parties to do that customization. We prefer to do a lot of that customization in-house, both to control the quality and the cost and to control the lead times that are associated with that. And that's one of the things we think is an important differentiator here is that we're going to take that business model as we've deployed it on our broad C&I product line. We're going to extend that into these new products and offer these customers customizations that are done at the factory from an engineering perspective and from a manufacturing perspective, sourcing perspective. Obviously, there are still pieces of this that will have to be done by third parties. Sometimes that can be a specific type of canopy or enclosure that's on the unit. Those could be still done by third parties, but we're going to try and capture much more of that than the market currently serves today. And we think that'll help differentiate us, coupled with the lower lead times, the shorter lead times, as we've talked in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord.
George Gianarikas: I can appreciate the widening of the range in guidance, given the macro uncertainty you have. I'm just curious if you can share any anecdotes, any data as to what you may be seeing on the ground day that may lead you to believe that we'll see a softening in business. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, George. Great question. There's a lot of different ways that different companies are approaching guidance, right? I mean, I think you guys have all seen a wide range of outcomes here with people, some companies preferring not to give guidance, others maybe giving multiple scenarios. Look, multiple scenarios, we're not that smart, so we just decided, look, we have our guidance. We know what our business does when the economy slows down, and we know the impacts that can occur from, as an example, higher prices, right? There are some elasticity of demand that we are aware of in different categories based on history. So we tried to apply all of that, put our best foot forward with guidance. We didn't think that pulling guidance was the right approach either. So we felt like giving, just basically sharing everything we know. And so to your question, George, what we know is that higher prices tend to dampen demand. Overcoming that, though, we also know that outages matter more than anything in our business. So as we've said historically here, I think we hesitate to use terms like decouple or, we're counter cyclical when it comes to the economy. But when the power goes out, people reprioritize their spending. And we tend to see generator sales be very resilient in the face of any economic condition, good or bad, frankly. And so our assumptions, I think the big assumption that we've made here and make every time we do guidance is that the outage environment is going to be in line with the long-term average. Should the outage environment be lighter than that, we could underperform. Should it be greater than that, we could outperform maybe that's at the low end of the range or the higher end of the range. I think we chose to take the low end of the range down because primarily where we do see pricing and have history with elasticity of demand impact is in the consumer market. So even though, even if we were to maintain outages or hit that outage number in the long-term average, there are going to be some buyers who may fall out of the funnel if prices go up. And we just know that. And we try to reflect that, I think, in our guidance to the best of our ability. But time will tell. I mean, there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty right now around the overall economic environment, the consumer in particular. But I think what we've seen on the ground and what you're hearing from others is the consumer is kind of hanging in there. I think Visa reported this morning, I think you're seeing consumer flows in terms of spending habits and things haven't really changed dramatically yet. But again, this is, there's a lot of uncertainty and we have to see what the next kind of 60 to 90 days brings. I think that will tell us a lot, both in kind of the statistics that we all watch. But also, kind of what happens with the current administration with some of the current trade policy efforts and the negotiations that are ongoing. So we're all waiting eagerly to hear what's going to happen next. I think the good news is we're used to having to pivot. We called out our core, one of our core values here at the company, which is agility. We're very proud of that agility. I think it underpins what we do here, being able to react to external stimuli that happen in demand, as well as, that things can happen on the supply side. And that's what we're reacting to today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: So just kind of a follow-up on that, Aaron. I certainly understand the logic behind the broadening out of the range. Just want to understand the moving pieces. At the lower end of the range, it sounds like that is driven almost exclusively by demand degradation, and you still feel relatively comfortable having, on an EBITDA dollar basis, neutral from all the tariff impacts. Is that true or false? Am I interpreting that correctly? And then secondarily, can you just give some sort of framework for how much of your COGS are exposed in any kind of regional sourcing dynamics you might have? Thank you, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Mike. So, yes, the low end of the range, I mean, what we want to do there, it's to reflect the potential impacts, by the way, to the consumer, right? So I mean, obviously, if you look at the midpoint of the guide, it does come down 150 basis points from the previous guidance, and that is, to your point, reflective of, in our assumption -- is reflective of a softer consumer environment. That demand destruction, if you want to call it that, being offset by pricing as well, higher pricing, and all of that going to offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis those pricing impacts to offset the tariff impacts. And to give you just, I mean, a little bit of color, we call that 125 million of potential impact here in the second half, given no mitigation efforts and the tariffs being exactly where they are today. That's what the second half would bring us, 125 million. From, just from a supply chain standpoint, we source about, so roughly 70% to 80% of our COGS is materials. We source about 50% of those materials are sourced in the U.S. or in North America. The other 50% outside of North America. And outside, when you look at kind of as a percentage of our total material purchases, this, it's really spread out. I mean, it's an incredibly global supply chain. We buy a lot from Europe. We buy a lot, obviously, from Asia, as do a lot of other companies. The China exposure specifically is less than 10% of our material purchases on an annual basis. And frankly, that's been cut in half from where it was five years ago. When we went through COVID and the first round of tariffs, we've been working very hard to further diversify our supply chain. In fact, with our new product offering and home standby, we're kind of taking the next leg of diversification of the supply chain, moving away from some of those countries that have higher tariff. And really we're on our roadmap to move away from anyway. So they'll come down even further. We think that that could be half again, that less than 10% could be something, even half again from that number in the next 12 to 18 months as we launch our new products and we get the supply chain oriented around further diversification. So we feel like we're in a good position here. We just have, to be very blunt, 145% is a big number for tariffs. Right? And so absorbing that is really difficult. And we have to pass that along in price. Now, if that doesn't persist here, if something changes in the next 30 to 60 days, we can still react to that. Because we have a new product line coming, we're going to reset pricing anyway on that new product line in the second half of the year. So we've got some time. And if you look at our balance sheet right now, you see a little bit more inventory on our balance sheet at the end of Q1 because we're building ahead of that transition. So sometimes better to be lucky than smart. Right? I mean, we were building because of this transition. But in effect, a lot of that inventory is not at these tariff levels. And also, as we called out, just as another note to that, you know, in our clean energy business with storage, we have a lot of inventory left over in that market as well. So we don't believe we're going to have any tariff impact to those products in 2025. It's really some on the consumer side and then on the C&I side. And that's what we're focused on mitigating that. And we're pedaling hard to do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond: So your 1Q to 2Q cadence is a little bit different than normal. I'm just wondering, what, if any, you saw of kind of pull forward, selling versus sell through, kind of getting ahead of price increases with your channel partners. And then just in general, how are IHCs after glow trending in the markets where you saw storms kind of relative to history? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, you want to take the pacing, York and then I will --
York Ragen: Yes. No, in terms of the pull forward question, yes, we did have a good quarter lost in all of this. Q1 was a very good quarter. I would say there was only a small amount probably that was pulled forward to get ahead of the price increases that were launching on home standby, maybe $20 million roughly. So it's a relatively small number on the pull forward side.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. And I would just say a commentary on the IHC kind of after glow, Jeff, to your question. It's interesting. I mean, this is a business where you see outages or have seen outages. You'll see strength in a lot of the metrics. And where outages haven't happened for a while, you won't. And so if you just kind of parse apart our 1Q IHC numbers, IHCs remain very strong, like in the southeast, coming out of the strong second half of last year with the outage environment. And then the western regions with what we saw in California with the wildfires, even though in our prepared remarks we talked about that. California represents still a pretty immature market for us relative to other markets in terms of -- a lot of outage hours, but we didn't get a ton of IHCs. It grew dramatically. But it kind of underperformed where we would expect a mature market to perform with that many outage hours. But that's really because it's still developing, right? We're less than 2% penetrated there. We're growing. It's double where it was, five years ago. But it still represents a great opportunity for us. But just, not the same level of intensity, if you will, of IHCs per outage hour there. And we kind of called that out. But the trends are, -- and then kind of on the off side of that equation, the Northeast, Canada, we didn't have a lot of outage events, winter outage events this year, kind of in the Q4 and Q1, and that, we have lower IHCs. So I think we're seeing good afterglow in those markets that struggled with outages last year, second half of last year, as well as what we saw in Q1. And in the areas that didn't, we kind of got what we would expect there, which is lower IHCs year-over-year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.
Brian Drab: I was wondering if we could talk about the impact, more specifically, of the assumption that the China tariff remains at 145%. Can you give us any granularity on, what percentage of COGS is currently materials, so we can kind of, I know you said material sales, materials input from China is under 10%, but it still seems like that could be a really big number. I'm trying to figure out what happens to your guidance if we reverse this situation with China or mitigate it significantly.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, sure. I would say this, the 125 million about two-thirds of that is really China-related. So, I mean, you can do the math on that, whatever, I don't have a calculator in front of me, but whatever that is.
Brian Drab: Okay.
York Regan: If it goes to 50, you can do the math.
Aaron Jagdfeld: If it's 80, 80-some million, whatever that is, if it goes to 50%, then you can compute the impact that that would have, not only in the second half of the year, but obviously, whatever 2026 models you might be looking at as well, Brian. But, yes, I mean, look, it's, again, China continues to be a smaller part of our supply chain overall and has, that's been a trend we've been on for, for some time now and continue to work at. I think the decoupling of these two economies is clearly underway, has been probably underway for some time. It's just being accelerated today with these current, with the current set of trade policy things in force, and if those change, if there's some kind of grand bargain that's struck here between the two countries. We'll watch that closely, because obviously, what we don't want to do, and I think what other companies probably are trying to avoid as well, is you don't want to, we're trying to avoid passing along the full impact of that to the market if we don't need to, right, if there's going to be some change. Or certainly, trying to reflect the future changes that are going to continue to happen in the supply chain, we want to reflect that in how we think about, we want to be thoughtful in how we think about pricing to the market, right? We don't want to just, because, again, increasing the prices is going to put pressure on demand. Even though outages, ultimately are the biggest thing that matter, you're still going to see people fall out of the funnel around the edges with higher price. That's just part of what the math is when you look at U.S. to see a demand around this category.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Aaron, we've seen just continued really good category interest into April, and I'm wondering if you could just talk about what kind of conversion rates you're seeing between IHCs into orders. I'm thinking of the chart you shared at the Analyst Day. Are we closing back to where we were in the last cycle on that category given the high level of interest in IHCs through April?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, thanks, Jerry. Actually, close rates, we kind of saw pressure in Q4, back half of last year, and this happens historically. When you get big demand events like we saw in the second half of the year, that tends to kind of swamp the boat in terms of our capacity with sales and installation bandwidth. And then, we fill in behind that with new distribution. We increased awareness in markets like California, like I was speaking to, that are a little bit more immature. And then close rates recover over time. So it's a cycle that's been repeated. Yes, you have to look at kind of the maturity of the close rate over time, looking at it at a point in time is, I think it's only representative of maybe what you've seen, just over 90 days as opposed to looking over a longer period of time. Some people just take longer to make that decision. And sometimes they need a promotion or they need an extra level of engagement with our teams or our dealer teams to get them over the -- off the fence in terms of buying. So we saw pressure on close rates again here in Q1. It's moderated from the decline rate that we saw in the second half of the year. But, we should start to see and have modeled a recovery of that for the balance of the year. Again, consistent with what we would see historically. But those rates were under pressure in the second half of the year last year and remain so here in Q1. As expected. Yes, wasn't anything worse than expected.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse: I apologize. I'm going to ask you to go down another rabbit hole here with kind of scenario analyses. But just thinking about the indirect impact of tariffs and specific to steel prices, which are up, 35, 40 percent-ish. I'm assuming your 2025 guide is buffered somewhat by your hedges. But assuming tariffs stay in place and steel prices remain elevated once those hedges expire, can you just kind of talk about how we should think about that in terms of either margin impact or the pricing reaction that might be needed in order to offset it? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Mark. Yes. So, I mean, we buy obviously our biggest inputs are steel, aluminum, and copper. Those are the three big ones. And I think to the point of your question, we saw some pressure there. Even if we have metals that weren't impacted directly by tariffs, the indirect effect of tariffs is that it gives steel producers and the mills and other fabricators gives them great air cover for increased pricing in some cases, or just the market, just is taking those prices higher. To your point, we have reflected that in our guidance here at the current level. So should they go higher? Could it be a headwind? We do have some hedges on some of those metals, but not dramatically so. It's pretty small. And so, I would just say that we reacted historically. The way we reacted with that is more price. But, we do have other levers to pull. We've referred to it a few times in the past. We have an ongoing profitability enhancement program. We call it PEP here. It's a cost-out program that's kind of institutionalized in our business. And we really use that to help us offset a lot of inflationary -- kind of typical inflationary pressures. I wouldn't call the tariff-related things typical by any means. But, I think some of the metals things, maybe you could argue they're atypical. But then again, you look historically where some of those metals prices are at, and they're not up kind of to the heights that they hit after -- when COVID hit, they are elevated. But we'll watch them. I think some of that is going to be offset by -- I always call it out. We're seeing shipping rates drop dramatically, right? So container rates, sailing rates from Asia to the U.S. are down -- they're in half from what they were even 30 days ago and falling hard. And I think everybody's seen the reports of just the number of sailings that are --, they're down 25%, 30%, 35%, over the last four to six weeks. And that is opening up, I think some opportunities there to reduce our logistics costs. So maybe there'll be an offset to some of that. So there's always moving pieces with those inputs. But, I would tell you that we've reflected everything in the guide today that we know. And we would respond accordingly with additional costs out. So we're pricing should those inputs go even higher in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.
Keith Housum: Hey, just trying to understand a little bit better, the impact of tariffs across the product line. Obviously, you guys got a pretty diverse lineup, focused clearly on HSBs but others as well. Can you just give us an idea which of your products are probably most impacted by the tariffs as well as the increased costs?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Keith, we're not going to provide it on a product-by-product basis because it's just, I mean, there's so many different products. Even within certain product families, we've got certain, items that are more sensitive to tariffs because of where we source them from than maybe a similar product in the same lineup. So it's just -- it's not really something that we're going to give that level of granularity around. Again, we would just point to kind of the $125 million that we've given. We continue to work that down. We believe we've got, great opportunities to mitigate. And again, that $125 million is completely unmitigated. That assumes, that other than what we've got in flight here, it assumes that, those tariffs stay at high levels and that we don't have any other mitigation opportunities. So should the tariffs either come down or the mitigations grow, the opportunities to mitigate grow, that will come down as well. So, I wouldn't say that any one of our products is more sensitive or less sensitive. We have sensitivities across all products in some manner to tariffs. There are just so many things in supply chain. I just don't, I don't know that people really get this. There's just so many whole industries that aren't here in the U.S. We can't buy things. We can't buy everything from the U.S. Maybe over time that could be developed, but definitely not over 30 days. That's just not how it works. And I think everybody's generally aware of that, but just having more time and being thoughtful about how we deploy this would be more helpful for companies, industries, markets to absorb. I do think that some of that's already underway, has been underway for the last several years, and will now accelerate. But there are also other big challenges on the other side of that in terms of availability of labor here in the U.S. The cost to automate, even if we automate, a lot of the automation equipment or parts of the automation equipment come from high tariff countries. So cost of automation is going to grow. So there's a lot of kind of structural issues that have to be dealt with here in order to shift these supply chains, whether it be reshoring or nearshoring, decoupling from specific other economies. It just takes time to do that. And we're all working towards that goal, and we're going to, you know, continue to work towards that goal, but there's going to be no avoiding some level of tariffs. And by the way, there were already tariffs in our run rate. The 125 is incremental tariffs based on the latest changes here. So there is a certain level of tariffs already in our run rate reflected from the previous 301 tariffs and other tariffs that were put in previous years.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Windham with UBS.
Jon Windham: Hi, perfect. Thanks. Just a quick housekeeping question. Just looking at your global manufacturing footprint, can you remind us the activities for Mexico, India, and China at the manufacturing facilities?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Sure. I mean, we have facilities in all three of those countries, and a lot of it is around a, in-country, for-country manufacturing strategy because generators are big, heavy products, and they're also localized for codes, codes and standards electrically and for a lot of tailpipe emissions that differ from one country to the next. We do manufacture some products. As an example, in Mexico, we called out the intersegment sales internationally to the U.S. There's a little bit there that we do manufacture, but a lot of what we do in Mexico is for Mexico and Central America, some for South America. What we do in India is almost exclusively for India. And what we do in China is for a mix of China and Europe primarily. So I think those footprints are well-established. I do think that it's interesting. I mean, we have some unique flexibility, I think, because of that as we examine, again, looking at mitigation strategies around tariffs, how can we utilize, best utilize our footprint, our international footprint to help us mitigate the impact of tariffs? Are there ways that we can shift more production to areas that where we benefit from the USMCA agreement as an example? Today, we don't do a lot of that down in Mexico, but we could maybe do more. I do think, we have a lot of plants right here in the U.S. as well. We just opened a new plant in Wisconsin, in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, one of our biggest plants in the U.S. Just went online April 1st. And that serves mostly our C&I products here in the U.S. and Canada for products. And so pretty proud of that. We've got seven facilities, seven big manufacturing plants here in the U.S. Been a big supporter of manufacturing here in the Upper Midwest for a long time. It's our heritage. It's our history. And frankly, the U.S. market still represents a great opportunity for us, and that's why we're committed to this market. But we're going to utilize our footprint in the best manner possible to help us mitigate the impact of tariffs.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Levy with Truist Securities.
Jordan Levy: I don't know how -- I didn't think I heard much on ET in the comments or in the Q&A, but maybe just on the Resi solar space. It still remains under pressure here in the near term, not a surprise. I know you've got some good inventory of PWRcells going to Puerto Rico this year to help kind of bolster that segment. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about some of the new product rollouts there and the economics around those given both the tariffs and kind of the domestic challenges to that market?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, thanks for the question, Jordan. And you're right, we haven't spent a ton of time on ET, but it actually had -- we had a great quarter in energy tech. A lot of that underpinned by ecobee, as we said. They continue to just knock the cover off the ball in terms of their market share. They introduced a new low-cost kind of entry-level TSTAT, smart thermostat, in the fourth quarter, and it's been very well-received and kind of going after that value portion of the marketplace. But even in the clean energy piece, which is the other piece of the energy technology complex for us, we also had a great quarter. Now it's off of a very small base, and it's primarily right now, as you indicated, Jordan, we've got this nice chunk of business with the Department of Energy program in Puerto Rico. We've got inventory for that program. We've got our installs. We're ramping there, and we're starting to hit our stride in terms of install rates and things. The economics are decent on that. But we've got our eyes on the future, as we have talked about here for some time, is we've been working on our next-generation product lines, for storage in particular. We opened up our order book here recently for PWRcell 2, which is the next-generation version of our storage system and have had some really good dialogue with installers who are looking for alternative options. There's been somewhat a consolidation in the storage market, given the current state of the solar market in general. Some of the suppliers are exiting. I think you may have seen yesterday Panasonic announced that they're leaving the U.S. market, and there have been others that have announced they're leaving the U.S. market as well. And that consolidation of supply, I think, opens up a couple of things for us, that could end up being positives, again, off of a pretty small base for us. But I think we've got some pretty high hopes that storage in particular, if you look at the economics, you can take away the incentives. And even if the ITC goes to zero, or there's some, recombination there of the ITC with more domestic content requirements, whatever that may be, with less support, the reality of it is power costs continue to rise. And that is the real kind of nugget, I think, that's really important here in why things like solar and storage are going to make sense long-term with or without support. Those things had to be weaned off of support at some point in the future anyway. And so I don't think anybody saw that coming, that it might be an abrupt weaning off of the support, but that might be filled in by certain state-level programs and things like that. I think the market's going to react to that. But I do think that when you look at the payback of a solar plus storage system in a high cost or a high tariffed area, high electrical rate tariffed area, the payback is still going to be strong, even without incentives. And the need for resiliency is still going to be strong, because power quality is continuing to go lower. And so we just, again, maybe that has some impact on the total addressable market in the near term here over the next several years until that washes through. But our new products, they're going to be lower cost, they're going to be higher performing, going to be kind of on level footing with the rest of the market offerings. And then we've got some other exciting new product offerings behind that, that we've alluded to in the past, but you'll hear more about it. That's the Renewable Energy Show in Las Vegas in September. So encourage you to come and see what we're launching there. But very encouraged by what we're seeing, certainly with our smart thermostats and our ecobee business. And then also, the recovery that we're seeing in energy technology at this point for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean Milligan with Janney.
Sean Milligan: Thank you for fitting in. Thank you for all the detail today. I guess on the $125 million impact from tariffs, can you kind of talk about how much you expect to get back from price increases versus cost out supply chain initiatives? And then also, I don't know if you addressed it, but last quarter you talked about price increases for the new product and residential home standby. Curious if you could update us on kind of how much total price increases you expect for Resi-HSB this year now with tariffs.
York Ragen: Yes, I think in terms of the pricing impact to offset the tariffs, at least the $125 in the second half, the philosophy we took is we wanted to have enough mitigations to offset the impact of those.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Dollar for dollar.
York Ragen: Well, at the EBITDA margin level.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Right.
York Ragen: Yes, so EBITDA percent, basically holding our EBITDA percent. So basically, so the price we're putting in the market, as well as the supply chain initiatives that we're working on, at least in the short term, should do that. Now, having said that, next, there's a lot more work going on behind the scenes from a supply chain standpoint to continue to mitigate and diversify our supply chain. So we'll work on that and continue to update our progress on that. But the pricing that we're going out with is to basically hold that EBITDA margin percent at the EBITDA line.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Right, and that was the announced pricing, the 7% to 8% price increases that went into effect March 30th. So that's what's contemplated in the guide. That's what York is referring to in terms of the offset to maintain EBITDA margins, basically in that category if we're just talking about home standby. Now, because we have a new product line coming in the second half of the year, we are going to go with another price adjustment there. But that's really reflective of the additional value that we're extending to customers and channel partners with that product, because there's a lot of additional features and things that are in that product that obviously there's a little bit more cost related to those, even take away the tariffs and everything else. In fact, I would argue the new product line actually reduces our tariff exposure because the supply chain is actually effectively more diverse. So there's a combination of that. So there's a lot of moving pieces underneath that. But at the end of the day, when you look, there might be a little bit more price associated with tariffs alongside of that increase that goes out for the new product line, but it won't be much. And 7 to 8 is really kind of the center point of that today. And then we'll have, yes, we'll kind of see where the tariffs land. Again, we're trying not to get ahead of ourselves with putting too much price in the market. We will if we need to. And we've kind of assumed that if we had to do that, we would. But I think we're watching closely to see where these negotiations go on a country-to-country basis with the current administration.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to the interest of time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Khris for closing remarks.

Kris Rosemann: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer, and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac Holdings Inc. or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements.

Additionally, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Kris. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results highlight our ability to rapidly increase production and execute on the strong demand for home standby and portable generators, resulting from the elevated power outage environment in the second half of 2024. Significant increase in demand for residential products led to fourth quarter records for net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, while free cash flow generation during the quarter reached an all-time quarterly record. Additionally, gross margins were very strong again during the quarter and drove adjusted EBITDA ahead of our prior expectations. Year over year, overall net sales increased 16% to $1.23 billion for the quarter. Residential product sales grew 28% from the prior year, driven by strong growth in shipments of home standby and portable generators, as well as an increase in shipments of residential energy technology products. C&I product sales, while still strong, were approximately flat from the prior year as increases in the domestic industrial distributor and telecom panels were offset by weakness in other C&I end markets. Favorable sales mix and lower input costs drove continued significant gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter, helping further accelerate adjusted EBITDA margins to 21.5%. Our full year 2025 guidance anticipates continued net sales growth, primarily driven by higher shipments of residential products. We project further gross margin improvement during the year on top of the very strong 2024 performance and expect to maintain strong adjusted EBITDA margins as compared to the prior year. Our current outlook does not contemplate the effect of any new tariff-related actions as we are currently evaluating the potential impacts, but we expect to offset any newly imposed tariffs through the combination of cost reductions and higher pricing. Before discussing fourth quarter results in more detail, I want to provide some full year 2024 highlights. Consolidated net sales returned to growth in the year as strength in domestic product sales more than offset weakness in certain C&I and international end markets. The sales mix shift to higher margin residential products and realization of favorable input costs helped drive full year gross margins to the highest level since 2010. The nearly 500 basis point year-over-year increase in gross margin to 38.8% supported a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as compared to the prior year. Robust earnings growth and focused execution on a reduction in working capital contributed to an all-time high for free cash flow generation of $605 million, easily surpassing the previous record of $400 million that was set in 2020. 2024 also provided significant evidence of the megatrends that support our enterprise strategy and long-term growth expectations. It was the most active year for power outages since we began tracking this data in 2010, with nearly 1.5 billion hours lost due to outages in the U.S., largely driven by three major landfall hurricanes in the second half of the year. Severe and volatile weather patterns have become increasingly common, placing even greater stress on our aging power grid. As more intense weather-related events are projected to further compromise the reliability of the power grid, recent wildfires in California and associated public safety power shutoffs provide yet another example of the challenges grid operators will continue to face well into the future. We also saw grid operators and utilities aggressively raise their future expectations of power demand during the year. Rapid adoption of artificial intelligence and the resulting data center build-out is projected to drive significant incremental demand on top of the established trends of electrification and reindustrialization in North America. At the same time, our nation's power supplies are transitioning to lower carbon sources, which are more intermittent in their operation, thereby creating additional pressure on reliability as demand rapidly accelerates. This growing supply-demand imbalance is threatening our power quality, with some areas of the country coming dangerously close to having insufficient power, particularly during periods of intense hot or cold temperatures when demand is at its peak. The North American Electricity Reliability Corporation recently warned that significant portions of the U.S. and Canada are at risk of power outages due to supply shortfalls over the next five years. These trends are also impacting the forecasted cost of electricity for end users, with prices anticipated to grow well beyond the 30% cumulative increase in average U.S. electricity prices that we have already experienced since 2020. Massive investments are needed in new generating sources, including additional transmission and distribution infrastructure, to support the growing demand for power, and these costs will be passed along to ratepayers in the form of higher electricity prices. These rising power costs and the increasing risk of outages support our expectations for continued growth in energy management technologies, as we believe homeowners and businesses will begin to invest more aggressively in solutions that help them reduce their electric bills and improve resiliency. As concerns grow about power quality and power costs, our Powering a Smarter World strategy is purposeful in the focus that it gives us as we develop energy ecosystems to help customers in the residential and C&I markets solve for these challenges. These ecosystems deploy a mix of assets and the software needed to optimize solar self-generation, battery storage, diesel and natural gas power generators, and load management devices, with a focus on giving homeowners, businesses, and institutions much greater control over the cost and availability of their power. Over the last several years, Generac Holdings Inc. has made a number of strategic acquisitions as well as significant investments in organically developing these energy ecosystems that we believe have dramatically expanded the total addressable market for the company and position us well for future growth of owner-occupied single-family unattached homes as the megatrends around lower power quality and higher power prices specifically for the home standby generator category continue to intensify. A significant penetration opportunity remains with only 6.5% of the addressable market, greater than $175,000 in value in the U.S., having a home standby generator installed at the end of the year. Furthermore, every 1% of incremental penetration is worth approximately $4 billion in retail market value, and with a market share above 70%, we believe Generac Holdings Inc. is incredibly well-positioned to continue to lead this important product category. Discussing our results in more detail, fourth quarter home standby shipments increased at a mid-20% rate from the prior year, following the elevated outage activity in the second half of the year. Home consultations during the quarter increased at a dramatic rate and reached record levels for the fourth quarter. Building on the category awareness created by the major outage events in 2024, we remain focused on increasing and optimizing our marketing investments to grow and diversify our sales funnel while delivering high-quality leads to our dealer network. As expected, close rates continued to moderate during the fourth quarter given the record-setting levels of home consultations we experienced in the second half of 2024. Historically, the compression of close rates occurs temporarily as our dealer network absorbs the rapid increase in demand in select markets that suffered from significant outage activity. We anticipate close rates will recover throughout 2025, resulting from ongoing investments in lead optimization, dealer development and expansion, consumer engagement, and further penetration of financing offerings for homeowners. Our residential dealer network continued to grow in the fourth quarter and ended the year at an all-time high of approximately 9,200 dealers, an increase of 500 from the prior year and 100 dealers ahead of the prior quarter. Significant growth in dealer count during 2024 not only increases overall category awareness but also provides support for a new and higher baseline level of demand for the home standby category going forward by adding more sales, installation, and service capacity. We also continue to see strong momentum in our aligned contractor program, which targets electrical contractors that purchase our products through wholesale distribution. We believe this highly aligned network of dealers and contractors is an important competitive advantage for Generac Holdings Inc. We continue to invest heavily to provide these partners with the best tools and capabilities to drive additional sales, installation, and service bandwidth. Activations or installations of home standby generators were nearly flat in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year. This was offset by other regions that saw less significant power outage activity in the quarter. Additionally, the later timing of hurricanes Helene and Milton and longer dealer project lead times in the impacted regions have led to stronger growth in activations thus far in the first quarter of 2025, with January marking a record high for the first month of the year. We continue to focus on innovation and leadership in the home standby generator category, and we recently introduced our newest lineup of home standby generators at our annual customer conference in Nashville last month. The next-generation product is our most comprehensive platform update in more than a decade and represents the most advanced home standby generator in the market. With this new product line, we introduced the industry's largest air-cooled generator, producing 28 kilowatts of output, providing homeowners that have higher power needs, such as electrical vehicle charging, heat pumps, and other large electric loads, the lowest total cost solution for backup power. Our next-generation product line further secures our position in this very important market segment with the broadest, most powerful, most cost-effective home standby generators in the industry. We believe that both our end customers and installer partners will appreciate the significant value-added and innovative features of these new products, which are expected to begin shipping in the second half of 2025. With this next-generation platform, we are introducing automotive technologies like fuel injection and spark ignition to the market, allowing for better fuel efficiency and lower emissions. We've also developed a new advanced controller with integrated cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity protocols as standard features, providing significant upgrades to connection quality, together with advanced remote diagnostics supporting the lowest total cost of ownership on the market. These numerous benefits for our partners in the field are expected to improve efficiency and quality control in the installation and service processes, including a simplified and automated commissioning process, streamlined wiring designs, and an enclosure designed with technicians in mind. In addition to our continued track record of innovation in the home standby generator market, we have also made significant investments over the last several years in our manufacturing capacity for these products. The addition of the Trenton, South Carolina facility, as well as increased automation around engine and alternator production, has dramatically increased our ability to meet the growing demand for these products, particularly during periods when demand surges. As a result of these investments, we were able to aggressively ramp our home standby production output to meet the increased demand following the active outage environment in the second half of 2024. Our ability to rapidly ramp production meant that home standby generator lead times did not increase significantly and were at normalized levels as we entered 2025. For the full year 2025, we expect home standby sales to increase due to a combination of the new and higher baseline of awareness for the category, new product introductions, and our initiatives to drive close rate improvements, dealer effectiveness, and marketing optimization. Longer term, given our competitive advantages and the significant penetration opportunity, we believe that Generac Holdings Inc. is uniquely positioned to deliver on the megatrends that support long-term growth for backup power. In addition to strong home standby shipments during the fourth quarter, sales of portable generators more than doubled from the prior year, as demand for these products is more sensitive to power outages in a given period. Our team continues to drive increased shelf space with our key retail partners for portable generators. While we expect these recent wins to benefit the second half of 2025, we will still face a challenging comparison to the prior year. As expected, sales of our residential energy technology products during the fourth quarter increased at a significant year-over-year rate, with growth coming from Ecobee and energy storage systems in the period. The Ecobee team delivered exceptional results during the fourth quarter, achieving record sales and positive profitability. In October, we introduced the Smart Thermostat Light, specifically targeting the professional contractor channel, and later, the Smart Thermostat Essential, two key additions to our lineup of energy monitoring and management devices that allow us to tap into the rapidly growing value segment of the smart thermostat market. We expect these new products to further support recent market share gains and continue to drive Ecobee's installed base of connected homes, which has grown to an impressive 4.25 million households as of the end of 2024. Our fourth quarter shipments of PowerCell Energy Storage Systems benefited from the ramp of the Department of Energy program in Puerto Rico, increasing at a very significant rate from the prior year. While the policy backdrop for the clean energy market is uncertain, we view the long-term fundamentals as intact given the megatrends of lower power quality and rising power prices, which we believe will only further incentivize homeowners to generate, store, and manage electricity on-site. Importantly, our recent new product announcements with PowerCell 2, PowerCell 2 Max, and our next-generation home standby generators are evidence of significant progress towards building out our residential energy ecosystem. PowerCell's market-leading single-cabinet storage capacity, together with our industry-leading home standby generator line, gives Generac Holdings Inc. the unique capability to offer a bottomless battery at a lower cost relative to a storage-only system that attempts to achieve a similar level of resilience by using multiple high-cost battery cabinets. This resilience, coupled with Ecobee's intelligent energy management capabilities and intuitive user interface, results in a differentiated solution that can make home energy more resilient, efficient, and cost-effective. For the full year 2025, we anticipate strong double-digit sales growth for our residential energy technology products, resulting in net sales of approximately $300 to $400 million for the year. Growth is expected to be driven by accelerated deployments of our PowerCell Energy Storage Systems in Puerto Rico, the new PowerCell 2 product launch expected late in the first half of 2025, as well as continued strength in Ecobee sales. Additionally, we anticipate Ecobee will achieve a major milestone in our journey to build a differentiated residential energy ecosystem by delivering positive profitability for the full year. Now, I would like to provide some commentary on our commercial and industrial products. Global C&I product sales increased slightly on a year-over-year basis as growth domestically was driven by strong execution in our manufacturing facilities, which was somewhat offset by softer international end market conditions. Domestic C&I product sales increased modestly during the fourth quarter as strong growth in shipments to our industrial distributor and telecom customers was partially offset by expected weakness in the rental and beyond standby end markets. Shipments to our North American industrial distributor channel grew again at a robust rate in the quarter as we continue to reduce lead times and invest in strengthening our distribution capabilities. Given our increased manufacturing throughput and extended end customer project lead times, growth in shipments outpaced the increase in orders from this channel during the year. As a result, we entered 2025 with a lower backlog as compared to the prior year, presenting a headwind to growth for the industrial distributor channel. Sales to our national telecom customers also increased at a strong rate on both a year-over-year and sequential basis during the fourth quarter. We expect to deliver strong year-over-year growth throughout 2025 as we believe this signals the start of the next growth cycle in this end market, given the long-term secular trend of increasing global tower and network hub counts that require backup power. As expected, shipments to our national and independent rental equipment customers in the fourth quarter continued to decline from the prior year as these accounts pulled back on capital spending in our categories during the year. Given our current visibility, these trends are expected to continue throughout 2025, although moderating relative to 2024. However, we continue to believe that this end market has further runway for growth as the cycle recovers, given the critical need for future infrastructure-related projects that leverage our products sold into the rental equipment channel. End market activity for our C&I generators used in beyond standby applications also remained softer during the fourth quarter as elevated interest rates continued to slow project activity in this segment of the market. We continue to see strong pipeline activity for our C&I battery energy storage systems, or BES, and other solutions used in multi-asset microgrids. We believe we are well-positioned to lead the C&I microgrid market given our strength in natural gas generators, distribution, and investments in technologies and expertise. In 2024, we completed two small but strategic acquisitions, adding C&I BES and microgrid controller capabilities and positioning our teams to help end customers solve for the challenges of lower power quality and higher power prices. Importantly, as our C&I energy ecosystem matures, we believe that our efforts to produce turnkey solutions for multi-asset microgrid projects will help to reduce the cost and complexity challenges that have hindered adoption to this point. In addition to our latest development efforts around C&I BES products and microgrids, at our annual customer conference, we recently introduced a larger diesel generator product lineup with single genset power output up to 3.25 megawatts certified for the U.S. market. These products are specifically designed for large load mission-critical backup power applications, including data centers. We believe that the megatrend of accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence and the associated build-out of data centers presents a significant long-term opportunity for Generac Holdings Inc., both directly through these new products and indirectly via increased power demand leading to overall grid instability issues. Initial quoting of these larger diesel generators is expected to begin in the second quarter, with the first shipments anticipated to occur later in the year, resulting in a minimal contribution to 2025 sales from this new initiative. Internationally, core total sales, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, increased modestly during the fourth quarter from the prior year as strength in Latin America was offset by continued softness in Europe. Importantly, however, international order activity regained momentum and outpaced shipments during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment expanded during the quarter due to favorable sales mix. For the full year 2025, we expect mixed end market and regional performance to continue in our international segment. Our C&I BES, microgrid, and data center initiatives will continue to focus on bringing new solutions to the market to improve our positioning in established markets while also driving an expanded presence and increased penetration in certain new regions, aligned with the megatrends supporting our enterprise strategy. In closing this morning, our record fourth quarter results reflect our significant leadership in the residential backup power market and unmatched ability to respond to the elevated demand created by power outage activity in the second half of the year. Our recent new product announcements underscore the commitment to innovation and engineering that have been in our core since we began pioneering backup power markets more than 65 years ago. We will continue to invest in the capabilities and solutions that we believe are necessary for the future. As previously discussed, the megatrends that support our future growth expectations have never been more evident, and we remain confident in our Powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy. I will now turn the call over to York to provide further details on our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results, as well as our outlook for 2025.
York Ragen: Sure. Looking at fourth quarter 2024 results in more detail, total net sales during the quarter increased 16% to a fourth quarter record of $1.23 billion as compared to $1.06 billion in the prior year fourth quarter. The net effect of acquisitions and foreign currency had a slight favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class, residential product sales increased 28% to a fourth quarter record of $743 million as compared to $580 million in the prior year. As discussed, growth in residential product sales was driven by a strong increase in shipments of home standby and portable generators on the back of an active power outage season. In addition, growth in shipments of both PowerCell energy storage systems and Ecobee products also contributed to the strong year-over-year growth. Commercial and industrial product sales for the fourth quarter of 2024 were approximately flat from the prior year but still strong at $363 million. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency had a slight favorable impact on sales growth during the quarter. This core sales performance was a result of strong growth in shipments to domestic industrial distributor and telecom customers, being offset by a decrease in sales to national rental equipment accounts and other direct customers for beyond standby applications, as well as a modest decline in international C&I product sales. Net sales for other products and services increased approximately 6% to $128 million as compared to $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Core sales growth of 4% was primarily due to growth in aftermarket service parts, connectivity subscription sales, Ecobee services, and other international services revenue. Gross profit margin was 40.6% compared to 36.5% in the prior year fourth quarter, as a result of favorable sales mix, the realization of lower input costs, and production efficiencies. Operating expenses increased $66 million or 28% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by increased employee costs to support future growth across the business, additional marketing spend to drive incremental awareness for our products, and increased incentive compensation and variable expenses on the higher shipment volumes and profit. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was a fourth quarter record of $265 million or 21.5% of net sales in the current year quarter as compared to $213 million or 20% of net sales in the prior year. For the full year 2024, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interest was $789 million or 18.4% of net sales as compared to $638 million or 15.9% of sales in the prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 20% to $1.07 billion in the quarter as compared to $891 million in the prior year, including approximately 1% sales growth contribution from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was an all-time record of $243 million, representing 22.7% of total sales, as compared to $192 million in the prior year or 21.6%. For the full year 2024, domestic segment total sales increased 9% over the prior year to $3.64 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 19.1%. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 1% to $187 million in the quarter as compared to $190 million in the prior year quarter. From foreign currency, resulting in an approximately 1% core total sales growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interest was $22.5 million or 12% of total sales as compared to $20.4 million or 10.7% in the prior year. For the full year 2024, international segment total sales decreased 13% compared to the prior year to $725 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests were 13.2% of total sales during 2024 as compared to 13.7% in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2024 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $117 million as compared to $97 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The current year net income includes the change in fair value adjustment related to our investment in Wallbox warrants and equity securities. GAAP income taxes during the current year fourth quarter were $27.3 million or an effective tax rate of 18.9% as compared to $30 million or an effective tax rate of 23.7% for the prior year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by the positive impact from earnings mix with higher earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, as well as certain unfavorable discrete tax items in the prior year which did not repeat in the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.15 in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $1.50 in the prior year. The strong year-over-year increase in GAAP earnings per share relative to growth in net income was primarily driven by a favorable $11.6 million redemption value adjustment that was reflected in the current year period EPS calculation, as well as a lower share count as compared to the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $168 million in the current year quarter or $2.80 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $126 million in the prior year or $2.07 per share. Cash flow from operations was $339 million as compared to $317 million in the prior year fourth quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was an all-time quarterly record of $286 million as compared to $266 million in the same quarter last year. The strong free cash flow performance was driven by the record fourth quarter operating earnings, together with a $170 million source of cash due to working capital reduction during the current year quarter. Total debt outstanding at the end of the resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter of 1.7 times on an as-reported basis, is within our target gross debt leverage range of 1 to 2 times adjusted EBITDA. For the full year 2024, cash flow from operations was an all-time record of $741 million as compared to $522 million in the prior year. Free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was also an all-time high of $605 million as compared to $396 million in 2023. The record free cash flow performance was aided by an over $200 million source of cash from working capital reduction during the year. Capital expenditures during the full year totaled $137 million as we prioritize organic investments for additional production capacity and other capabilities to support future growth. We also strategically deployed approximately $35 million of capital in 2024 for acquisitions to accelerate our Powering the Smarter World enterprise strategy and bolster our technology and distribution capabilities for our C&I products. Additionally, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 1.05 million shares of our common stock during the full year for $153 million, leaving $347 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of 2024. We extended the maturity of our term loan B credit facility during the year and also repaid approximately $278 million of debt. Moving forward, we will continue to operate within our disciplined and balanced capital allocation framework as we evaluate future shareholder value-enhancing opportunities. With that, I will now provide further comments on our new outlook for 2025. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are initiating 2025 net sales guidance that anticipates continued solid year-over-year growth for the full year period. We expect consolidated net sales for the full year to increase between 3% to 7% compared to the prior year, which includes a slight unfavorable impact from the net combination of foreign currency and acquisitions. Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the year in line with the longer-term baseline average. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year, such as a major hurricane or major winter storm. Breaking this down by product class, we expect overall residential net sales to increase at a mid to high single-digit rate from the prior year. We expect this growth to be led by shipments of home standby generators as the elevated power outage activity in 2024 results in a new and higher baseline level of demand for the category. In addition, we expect strong year-over-year growth for our residential energy technology products as we execute on previously announced project wins in Puerto Rico and launch new products into the market. Growth is expected to be partially offset by lower portable generator shipments in 2025, given the assumption of no major outage events included in our guidance. As Aaron discussed in detail, we anticipate mixed performance across our C&I end markets both domestically and internationally in 2025. We expect growth from telecom, C&I BES, and data center opportunities to be mostly offset by declines in rental, beyond standby, and domestic industrial distributor shipments. In addition, we expect the effect of foreign currency to have a modestly unfavorable impact on year-over-year growth for C&I products. Considering these factors, overall global C&I product sales are expected to be approximately flat on a year-over-year basis during the year. From a seasonality perspective, given lead times and backlog for our home standby products have normalized coming into 2025, we expect 2025 consolidated net sales to follow normal historical seasonality, resulting in overall net sales in the first half being between 44% to 45% weighted, with sales in the second half being 55% to 56% weighted. Specifically for the first quarter, we expect overall net sales to increase at a low single-digit rate from the prior year, with strong growth for residential product sales partially offset by a high single-digit decline in C&I product sales. Looking at our gross margin expectations for the full year 2025, we expect the full-year impact of lower input costs will drive continued year-over-year margin improvement, resulting in an approximately 100 basis point increase for the full year as compared to 2024, approaching 40%. Importantly, the recently announced tariff actions are not directly reflected in this guidance. As we continue to evaluate the potential impact from these tariffs, we expect that any increase will be offset by a combination of cost reductions and price increases, resulting in an EBITDA margin percent neutral impact for the year. From a seasonality perspective, we expect gross margins to increase throughout the year from approximately 38% to 39% in the first half of 2025 to approximately 40% to 41% in the second half of 2025, primarily as a result of favorable sales mix and improving input costs. Looking at our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations for the full year 2025, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are expected to be approximately 18% to 19% for the full year 2025, compared to 18.4% in 2024, as the full-year impact of rising operating expenses will offset the aforementioned gross margin improvement. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to follow normal seasonality and improve significantly as we move throughout the year. Specifically, regarding the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately flat compared to the prior year at approximately 14%, and then improve sequentially throughout the year, reaching approximately 21% in the fourth quarter. Significant operating expense leverage on the seasonally higher sales volumes, together with the previously mentioned favorable sales mix and cost improvement, are the main drivers of this EBITDA margin sequential improvement throughout the year, which is expected to result in second-half adjusted EBITDA margins to be more than 500 basis points higher than first-half margins. As is our normal practice, we are also providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2025. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add-back items should be reflected net of tax using our expected effective tax rate. For 2025, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 24% to 24.5% as compared to the 22.6% full-year GAAP rate for 2024. We expect interest expense to be approximately $74 to $78 million for the full year 2025, assuming no additional term loan principal prepayments during the year. This is a significant decline from 2024 levels due to a decrease in outstanding borrowings coming into 2025 and the full-year impact of lower SOFR interest rates. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year, in line with historical levels as we continue to invest in incremental capacity and execute other projects to support future growth expectations. Depreciation expense is forecast to be $83 to $87 million in 2025, given our assumed CapEx guidance. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2025 is expected to be approximately $92 to $96 million during the year. Stock compensation expense is expected to be between $53 million to $57 million for the year. In line with normal seasonality, operating and free cash flow generation is expected to be disproportionately weighted toward the second half of the year in 2025, as we expect to replenish home standby and portable generator inventory levels during the first half of 2025. As a result, for the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion from adjusted net income to be between 80% to 90%. Our full-year weighted average diluted share count is expected to increase modestly to approximately 60.5 million shares, as compared to 60.3 million shares in 2024. And finally, this 2025 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions that could drive incremental shareholder value during the year. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we would like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone, then wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Please limit yourself to one question only. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens. Your line is open.
Tommy Moll: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Aaron, I wanted to ask about your comments regarding some of the new and larger C&I products that you plan to introduce where the data center market aperture, I think, is a little wider now. Can you just give us a little more context? How much of the TAM does this unlock for you, and what's the strategy to penetrate that? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Tommy. Yeah, we're very excited about the announcement here. Honestly, our distributor customers and other customers are also very excited. We've actually been on this journey internationally. Our international team started working on a larger product offering and actually engaging with data center partners. They've been doing that actively over all of 2024, and they'll begin actually shipping products into the market here this year, just starting to get the flywheel spinning there. And now we've got a U.S. certified version of it. As far as the total addressable market, I think there's a lot of numbers that are out there available to the public about how quickly data centers can be built out. And so, you know, I think I hesitate to probably provide a discrete number along those lines, but just to say that some of the data points that are available in the marketplace, you would look at the current lead times of these types of products from the existing suppliers, and they are very long. In many cases, most cases, they're well in advance of a full year, some even longer than that depending on the product nodes. The entire supply chain for these products is very tight today as a result of all the increased demand. So we believe there's ample room for us to participate. We think there's ample room for us to be successful given our brand, given our ability to serve these types of customers on a national basis. A lot of these data center developers are developing in markets all over the country or the world. And so having a global footprint as well as a coast-to-coast U.S. footprint is valuable in terms of making sure that we have the ability to provide the kind of aftermarket support that's needed to ensure the kind of uptime that's required by the data center operators themselves. So very excited about this. As I said in the prepared remarks, it's not going to be much of a contribution to our domestic results this year because the U.S. certified versions of these products really won't begin shipping until late in the fourth quarter. We're going to open the order book in the second quarter, so that'll give us some insight into demand. We're already having what I would call or characterize as encouraging dialogue with a lot of data center customers, owner-operators, developers. And so we're encouraged by that. So more to come in the future, but an exciting development for us.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord. Your line is open.
George Gianarikas: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. So just very quickly, I noticed you mentioned that Ecobee would turn to profitability in 2025. Can you just sort of illuminate as to how much margin dilution the total energy tech business will have overall on Generac Holdings Inc. and whether you still expect that to get to breakeven potentially in 2026? Thank you.
York Ragen: Hey, George. This is York. Yeah, so we're pleased. Actually, Ecobee delivered above breakeven quarter for Q4. So we were encouraged by that and looking out at the growth opportunities that they have for 2025. They were projecting that profitability will continue for the full year 2025. In terms of the overall energy technology business, which I think was your question, while in 2024, the dilution of that business overall for the whole total, the dilution on the overall company, that's going to improve somewhere maybe to 3%, 3.5% here in 2025. So there will be improvement, and that will continue to improve over the next couple of years as we continue to...
Aaron Jagdfeld: And, George, clearly, the important milestones here in that business are getting these new products to market, right? So we've got PowerCell 2. We're introducing midyear here. And then our Power Micro, which we've also talked about, we've got kind of our eyes on the second half here for that product to get into market as well, but we are making very good progress on both of those product lines. I think the one change, referring to the commentary about getting to profitability overall by the end of the year, by the end of 2026, even if we did that, by the way, there'd still be some dilution overall from EBITDA on EBITDA margins from this effort at least for the next several years. But I think that obviously, the policy landscape is shifting. And we're watching that very closely. And due to mainly due to the high interest rates, I think that was the sticky point in 2024 in terms of growth in energy technology, even though we found our footing there, delivered a nice Q4, and we won some nice projects. But we'll see where the policy landscape goes here. I think longer term, these are technologies. Whether you're talking about solar, you're talking about battery storage, or you're talking about electric vehicles, or talking about energy management, these are technologies that are going to be critical to helping homeowners and businesses, as I said in my prepared remarks, to help them gain much greater control over the resiliency of their power as well as the cost of that power. I think the one kind of thing that's been going on here, look, we know power quality is a problem. Everybody knows that. There's a lot of data around that. There's no secret that that's been why Generac Holdings Inc. has done so well over the last several decades. But the reality of it is one of the other kind of things that's coming up quickly here is power costs are increasing. And I don't think we're talking about that enough. As a society, we are seeing evidence, you know, the U.S. national average is up 30% in the last four or five years. Projected to double by 2035. There are parts of the country today where the power bill, the electric bill, is second only to the rent or your mortgage in terms of your highest cost expense for a homeowner or a business. So these are things that, and these are trends. Like I said, we call them megatrends. Lower power quality, higher power prices. These are the two things that are front and center for us in what we're doing in all the investments we're making here in the future, not only in our legacy products like generators but also in the energy ecosystem.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open.
Mike Halloran: Hey. Good morning, guys. Good morning. So just a couple of parts of this, but all related. So could you just, I think I missed it. Can you repeat what the residential growth expectations are for the first quarter? But more broadly, maybe talk about how you're looking at the performance in this outage environment with the new facility in the southeast, that manage your lead times, and then how you're looking at the back part of last year, front part of this year just from a cadencing versus history and just kind of put all that in context to help understand how the guide rolled through this year and how instructive this maybe is for future outages. Because, obviously, the lead time variances versus history were much better.
York Ragen: Yeah. Just quickly, on the very first part of that, you're asking about resi growth in Q1. Yeah. In the prepared comments, we said strong growth, again, partially offset by the high single-digit decline in C&I products. So it's a strong double-digit growth for resi in Q1.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And then, Mike, I think the balance of your question, kind of the pacing or the way the business is, I'll say, trading, that part of the business back half of last year, end of this year. You know, I think what's really interesting, so if you go back historically, right, as the category's been growing, and, you know, as every kind of active period of outages driving demand rapidly. And then, you know, we've responded by trying to play catch up, frankly, in terms of capacity, and as we said, resulting in kind of where we got to, you know, as we exited 2021 and into 2022 where we were getting these lead times in the category that were just super extended. So we took the necessary moves to stop playing catch up and made some significant investments in capacity for home standby generators. We brought the Trenton plant online midyear 2022. We added a lot of automation and probably haven't talked as much about the automation we've added as much as we've talked about the Trenton facility. But in our existing facilities in Whitewater and additional automation even in Trenton over the last couple of years that has significantly changed our overall theoretical capacity for the category. And what that's allowed us to do is rapidly respond, much more rapidly respond to the surges in demand that, as an example, the back half of last year, what we saw to have that kind of environment, we would have typically had this been pre those investments. You would have seen us enter 2025 with probably a large backlog as a result of two things. One, our inability to produce enough product to satisfy demand in the back half of the year. And two, what that creates. I think there's a really important kind of emotional element I just want to talk about a second here. When there is scarcity in a market, and we all saw this during COVID, but we've seen it in our business. Notably, over the years, every time there's a major event, we get a scarcity mentality amongst our distribution partners. And when lead times start to extend, they start to place more orders to guarantee supply further out. Further out the lead times go, the further out they place orders, the more orders they place. And you get this emotional buying that comes from that scarcity. We did two important things. We added all this capacity, and then we also changed the number of our order policies. We think that the effect of doing those two things basically took the emotion out of that ordering and kept certainly kept lead times from getting long, and it kept dealers from placing orders for products that they hadn't sold yet. And I think that was the significant change here and should be the significant change going forward. Right? I think that when we think about it, we think that this is a healthier way to run the business. We think also, I think it's important to note, Mike, that when you put this in context, it's a much bigger business. If you just look at Home Standby, the base business of what's going on there every single day in the absence of outages, major outages, is pretty remarkable. And that continues to grow. And the pen rate still being at only 6.5% at the end of the year, it's amazing just how big the penetration opportunity remains for us. So it's one of the major reasons why we've been so confident to invest heavily in the capacity and invest heavily in automation, invest heavily in new products like our next-generation product line that we just announced here. So, again, I think these are things a great setup for us to continue to lead that market. I think it's going to, I think it's a different kind of pacing as it goes forward, which I think is the core of your question.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond: Hey. Good morning, guys. Good color there. Maybe just to follow on, because I appreciate the investments and maybe the change in order patterns. But maybe just feedback you're getting from your contractors on the three big storms and kind of the uptake in IHC's relative expectations and then, you know, kind of the afterglow effect that you're seeing, you know, versus kind of past similar storms. That'd be great.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Jeff. So I do think notable with these storms is they were fairly concentrated regionally. Right? So and you could argue, I mean, Merrill was Texas. That happened in July. And, you know, while a powerful event, it was fairly localized to the Texas market, which is a good market for us. And when you look at and really Houston, and when you look at Texas, in fact, you know, now that state's pen rate is actually closing in on the national average, which is really interesting. So I mean, I think that, you know, from where we were, at 2% to 3%, you know, we're all the way up to 6% now. So it's grown a lot over the last several years since the freeze of 2021. But then you think about, you know, Helene and Milton. Obviously, Helene was more widespread. Right? That was the biggest event that we had seen in a long time, impacting largely Florida and then the Carolinas. Then you got Milton on the back of it. Milton was a smaller storm and kind of impacted the same Florida markets. For the most part, and it was two weeks later. So you could almost argue that that was an extension. Like, when we look at our, like, all the stats that we track, it almost when you look at the Milton stats, almost look like an extension just elongated the Helene impact for us. So my point here is that we have these concentrated events. You know, we have good dealer bases in those areas, but they were inundated with IHCs. I mentioned in the prepared remarks the compression of the close rates. So, you know, the commentary coming back is that, you know, there was we need more bandwidth for sales and now that's getting into installs as well. We're seeing activations now, you know, the major storms, you know, if you look at Helene and Milton, hit really kind of beginning of Q3 or Q4, excuse me. End of Q3, beginning of Q4. Our normal project timeline from quote, doing that IHC to doing the actual install, call it 100 days, 110 days, 120 days depending on the market. Florida tends to be longer because of the permitting cycles there. So we're just now starting to see the impact of the installs occurring in those markets. It just takes time to mature. Right? It takes time to mature. So, you know, we think that those markets are going to be active. Texas, Florida, the Carolinas as a result here. Going into 2025. The flip side of that coin is we had other markets around the U.S. that were, frankly, not as active last year as they had been. Right? So places in the Midwest, Michigan, Ohio, those in particular notable areas, of Canada where we've actually done quite well in Ontario, over the years. We're much quieter last year. So we saw growth, we saw the activation rates slow or the install rates slow, IHC slow. In those markets year over year. It was kind of, I'll say, kind of quote-unquote covered up, if you will, by the, you know, the large influx of IHCs from those events. But again, I think this is one of the interesting things about how this business trades, if you will. Again, I'll use that term, but, you know, outages are, they're localized, but they happen every day all over the place. You know, we're seeing IHCs in California that are notably higher in January versus last year because of the power safety shutoffs, you know, and that, you know, that so it moves around. And that's why having a huge dealer base like we have, 9,200, we need more. Is such a huge focus for us because having those dealers in those markets where and how it could occur and then helping propel those markets forward even as the initial demand surge wanes. You want those dealers in market, marketing, selling, and promoting the category and the product. I think that's really critical, and it's a big part of that new and higher baseline demand concept that we continually talk about. And that I think we've demonstrated continues to play out.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian Drab: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess there's a lot of focus on home standby. So maybe, yeah. Good morning. Maybe ask you to talk a little bit more about C&I. I know you said telecom's getting better. I was wondering if you could add a little more color on what's driving that improvement. We're hearing that from some other companies. And what can get this rental market going again for you guys? And, you know, we're expecting in some areas, like highway activity, construction, new oil and gas with some of the new policies and new administration, maybe pick up there. Is there any hope that maybe that gets going in the back half of the year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. Thanks, Brian. Appreciate the shift over to the C&I business, which we never end up talking enough about, and it's a really great business for us. It's a great kind of steady counterweight to some of the volatility we sometimes see in the res business. But, yeah, the telecom market, as we said, kind of bottomed in Q3, Q2, Q3, and we were seeing green shoots in our discussions with customers, and that actually played out in better sell-through and sell-in and sell-through in Q4. You know, again, I think probably just to answer your question directly about what's at the root of that. In our markets, we can point to very easily the high-profile outage events. Every single carrier had challenges with network uptime as a result of those events, and that always tends to, I would say, help them reevaluate or reevaluate just, you know, kind of where the level of investment's going to be needed going forward to harden the network. And so today, we think, you know, tower counts continue to grow, hub counts continue to grow. That market's probably about 50% penetrated with backup power. So, you know, there's a huge market there. It's a more than 400,000 overall site opportunities for us. And, you know, we just we see that as we're the leader there by far in terms of our customer base and our installed footprint. So we're encouraged by that. We think that the investment cycle is going to be positive for that business, you know, as we go forward here into 2025. And, you know, the flip side of that coin, you know, rental. You mentioned it. You know, what can we do to get that going again? You know, what, you know, it's our product categories, light towers, mobile generators, mobile heaters, in particular, maybe somewhat disproportionately impacted by CapEx spending for these customers of ours because they had gone through, if you recall, we had some pretty robust years there where they were refleeting. And those fleets are aging. There's no question they're aging. And I think, you know, when we put this guidance together, you know, obviously, the political environment and the policy environment continues to shift here. And so, you know, could domestic oil and gas production create potential tailwinds there for us? Could additional infrastructure investment that might be being contemplated by the new administration, could that create tailwinds for us that might accelerate that? Possibly. The way we've built our guidance is we're not contemplating that. We're basically contemplating that that market's going to be, you know, down again. Although not nearly at the rate it was down last year, it's moderating the decline. But, you know, we still think that in particular, you know, Q1, there's a little bit more to come off. That's part of what the C&I, you know, down, that York talked about in Q1 in particular is just kind of comping last year's rental. That was when things really kind of started to come off. But, you know, we've seen this movie before. It's a very cyclical market. And we don't believe we've lost any share. And we believe the need is still there and the fleet is aging. So it's just a question of when the trigger gets pulled from a capital spending standpoint on refleeting.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jerry. Thanks. Aaron, York, can we just expand on the cadence of the standby business over the course of 2025 and, you know, just how much visibility do you have on the ramp over the year based on the planned installations? So, typically, given the ramp in home consultations, we typically see a pig through the python effect with a, you know, much sharper Q1. It doesn't sound like that's happening this year, and I'm wondering if you could just expand on the visibility that you folks have on the standby business ramping up over the course of a year as these leads translate into installations.
York Ragen: Yeah. No. I think, Jerry, I think as I said in the prepared comments, we said that our guidance basically assumes the long-term baseline outage. We basically look at long-term baseline outages. We take all major events out of the mix, and we look at what outage activity is on a baseline basis over the last five years. And we use that as our basis for putting together our guidance. And we also look at the seasonality of those outages as well. It tends to have more outages due in the second half of the year. So, and then you couple that with the comment we made that coming into 2025, we're at normal lead times. So we have inventory of these products. So basically, we believe that the guide for home standby for 2025 then is going to look more just like sort of normal seasonality in terms of how we pace that.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. And with nice growth up for the full year. Absolutely. And that's been a historical kind of trend. And that is largely driven by just the larger patterns around seasonality. You know, with Q1, so in particular in the winter areas, the impact areas of the U.S. impacted by winter weather, it's harder to install products. So, you know, the snow covering the ground in a lot of areas and the cold weather just prevents installations from being affected. So that's why Q1 is almost always a lower quarter. Again, this kind of goes back to my expanded description of the, you know, the change in the pacing of the business here. Normally, you know, if we had come in with a large backlog, we would be satisfying that, and Q1 is shipping against that. That doesn't necessarily mean they would have been installed until, you know, until things got warmer, we would just have been satisfying backlog. We didn't have that this year because we basically satisfied all that in Q4 and took the emotional ordering off the table with that approach. So, you know, I think the pacing is going to return to a more normal pacing, you know, growing from Q1 throughout the year, as York said.
Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Kashy Harrison: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones or two quick sets of questions for me. The first one is on the data center opportunities. Are these edge data centers or larger data centers, and then are these backup or prime power generators? And then, just on the OpEx side, you know, if we look at 2025, I think on a dollar basis, you're more or less in line with where 2026 was going to be at the investor day on a dollar basis. But we're obviously pretty far away from those revenue targets. And so, you know, how do you, does that mean that, you know, getting to 20% EBITDA margins is no longer a focus? I'm just trying to understand how you're currently philosophically thinking about the appropriate level of, you know, bottom line, margins, and OpEx investments on a multiyear basis. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. Kashy, I'll take the first half of the question and then maybe let York add some commentary around the OpEx, EBITDA margin kind of targets for the long term. So with the data center product, that product is aimed at both edge data centers as well as hyperscale. Today, we have products for edge data centers. The market we dabbled in, we probably haven't focused on it as much, but the new products are diesel backup-only generators. So they're emergency backup. They're not for prime power. They are U.S. certified, and they will be targeting both the hyperscale market as well as the edge data centers. York, I think, on the OpEx, it's kind of questioning...
York Ragen: Yeah. And the OpEx, I think, longer term, our projections of EBITDA margins are still in that low 20% range. You know, 21%, 22%, which is what we guided to back in our investment day way back when in 2023, that those expectations still hold. As we, I think as Aaron said, I guess, a couple of them are C&I, the down cycle probably happened a little bit, I guess, deeper and sooner than we were projecting in those investor day targets. And then the clean energy business is, you know, that market's been a bit soft here for the reasons Aaron talked about. So I would say that, you know, pushing that out, call it 12 to 18 months, then you start really leveraging that OpEx load, and you get closer, you know, to those low 20% EBITDA margins that we were expecting back in the original Investor Day materials.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And gross margins didn't...
York Ragen: And gross margins are very attractive.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. Good.
York Ragen: As well. They're actually better.
Aaron Jagdfeld: They're better.
York Ragen: They're actually coming in faster than we were...
Aaron Jagdfeld: And that's kind of the offset, I think.
York Ragen: Yep.
Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Mark Strouse: Yes. Excuse me. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking our questions. I wanted to go back to the tariff conversation. I appreciate what you're saying about 2025 and the ability to have a neutral impact from pricing and cost cuts. Medium term though, I mean, has what you've seen over the last, you know, three or four weeks been enough to kind of change how you're thinking about medium term and maybe increasing the amount of domestic supply for your raw materials? And then kind of a follow-up question to that is, can you maybe compare and contrast Generac Holdings Inc. to your competitors? Do you see that as potentially an advantage or a disadvantage if the tariffs really do start ramping up here? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Mark. Thanks. I can't speak to our competitors. I'm not exactly sure of their cost structures and how they're thinking about the tariffs. I can speak to, you know, what we know, you know, obviously, the 10% impact on China, the 25% threatened impacts to Mexico and Canada. That has been deferred for at least 30 days. You know, we've obviously done, we have more time to react to that. Monday's news or Sunday night's news about a 25% tariff on, you know, metals on steel and aluminum, we're evaluating. But we already have a pretty robust domestic supply chain around, certainly around sheet metal, around metal. So we're not as concerned about that, to be honest. You know, we have to evaluate aluminum to understand that. But on, you know, on the tariffs that the 10% on China, I think one of the benefits of having gone through the crawling through the broken glass that we all crawled through back in COVID, in terms of supply chain disruptions and, you know, needing to deal with that is that, you know, we got a lot smarter about not being sole sourced on a lot of components, in particular, everything with our home standby is our goal to have at least two sources, if not three. Now that's not only both for resiliency in the supply chain but also for additional capacity just because we've grown the overall, you know, output. We just need to add more competent suppliers. But we've done that also with a focus to not have concentrations of supply base in certain regions of the world. And that has helped us then to, it's given us flexibility to shift supply to areas of the country or areas of the world, excuse me, that are not impacted by tariffs. That said, I don't think there's any avoiding some kind of cost increase that's going to come through, you know, whether it be additional logistics or those secondary sources perhaps being higher cost than maybe a primary source. All of that, you know, we're working through. But we see the impacts of that one, going to go back to supply chain and we're going to say, okay. You know, if we've got a supplier in China, let's say, we're going to go back and we're going to ask that supplier to evaluate their cost, their price to us to reduce that, to absorb the tariff. After all, that's what leadership of this country has been telling us. It's not us who pay for it. It's the other country. So let's make sure that happens. So we're going through and we're working through that. But that probably is not realistic to assume that all suppliers are willing to absorb the added cost of tariffs or, you know, about 25% in Mexico or Canada that, you know, we've got to continue to evaluate that. But I think long term, you know, if you look at the rest of the year here, there's going to be some pricing actions. There's going to be more cost out, so we're going to focus on. We're going to try and minimize the pricing actions to the best of our ability. We know that price is important to customers, and we want to remain competitive. Today, we lead the market in price. We believe that this won't change that. Again, I can't speak specifically to our competitors other than to say, you know, we have tremendous scale in some of these markets like home standby that is unmatched, and that is probably a bigger benefit, to be honest, both within the supply chain as well as of our operating environment than, you know, anything our competitors could offer.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Levy with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Jordan Levy: Good morning, all. And thanks for all the details. I just wanted to touch on the next-gen home standby rollout later this year. Can you just talk about how we should think about pricing and cost structure there on that line relative to the current fleet and what's sort of baked into your guidance on that front as you roll it out in the back half of the year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. There's certainly, you know, the feature set we talked about, Jordan, there, you know, there's some additional cost in that product. We think it's fairly nominal in relation to the overall cost of the product, but there is, you know, there's going to be some additional costs, and then as a result, the pricing will be higher when the new line hits the market in the second half of the year. So we have put some pricing in. We've made some assumptions around pricing impacts. We haven't formally initiated that pricing through the market at this point, largely because of the tariff noise that's going on. We want to kind of see where things land. I mean, the last thing we'd want to do is put pricing out on a new product line and then have to adjust it before we even start shipping. So we want to understand supply chain impacts from the tariffs and some other things as we, you know, and we'll finalize that here shortly. I mean, we do have to get pricing up to the market. And we had to bake an assumption into our guidance. But, you know, it's pretty nominal. I think it's small on balance for...
York Ragen: It's pretty modest, but there is some pricing there in the second half of the year as a result of that.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with North Coast Research. Your line is open.
Keith Housum: Good morning, guys. I'll try to make it quick here. York, I think I thought I heard you guys say that for 2025, you expect energy technology sales of $300 to $400 million. I guess, first, can you compare that to what you have for 2024? And then second, you know, threats to, you know, by the administration to withhold funding for some of the agencies that are out there, I would assume the Department of Energy would be one of the agencies perhaps at risk. Could that perhaps slow some of your expectations with your 2025?
York Ragen: Yeah. Keith, the comparative number we ended at $280 million in 2024. So the midpoint of the $300 to $400 is like a 25% increase.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Right. On net sales.
York Ragen: On net sales. Right.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And, Keith, your question about the DOE, I mean, clearly, there's a lot going on in the policy world. You know, we have not received a formal notice that this program, and I'll speak specifically about the Puerto Rican DOE program. We've not received notice that that program has been canceled formally. And it is, I think it's important to note that it's not tied directly to IRA funding or to any of the infrastructure funding that was the bipartisan infrastructure law that was out there from 2023, actually, I think is or 2022 even, maybe. I don't know. That funding came from. But, you know, IRA and BIL, they're not, this Puerto Rican DOE grant is not tied to that. It's separate. I don't know if that gives it any better standing or worse. I would also note that one of our major competitors in residential batteries, Tesla, has a, you know, they're the largest residential battery provider in the DOE program for Puerto Rico. So, you know, I think does that mean anything? I don't know. I'm just saying I think it's an important interesting point of context, I think, around whether or not this program is targeted. But, again, we've not received any official notification. And I would say that it's why we're putting a wider range on the sales for this year, $300 to $400. It's, you know, there's more risk there. Obviously, with the current policy environment, we'll see where it goes. You know, we're still pretty excited about the opportunity when we bring new products into the market. You know, that entire business was not built on big projects like the Puerto Rico DOE business. That's a nice opportunity for us this year, but long term, you know, we believe that self-generation, storage, resiliency, controlling power costs, these are all important things and considerations for homeowners and why these technologies over time, we believe, are going to be needed. And why they're important to our Powering a Smarter World strategy.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Bagri with Citi. Your line is open.
Vikram Bagri: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about some of the assumptions underpinning the guidance. I think, Aaron, you talked about a surge and pullback in demand last quarter. How much is the anticipated pullback baked into the guidance after the strong surge you witnessed last year? And on a related note, you talked about, you know, probably looking at pricing on new products and maybe more due to tariffs. I mean, you've rightly said it's a price-sensitive market. How do you reconcile increasing pricing versus a strategy to push close rates higher? And what would be the strategy to test the market for pricing? Would you run pilots? Would you, how do you understand how much today is the pricing that would you slowly raise pricing and see what the impact on close rates will be? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. I think, you know, I can talk a little bit. I think your question, Vikram, on the, you know, the surge, there's no, we're not anticipating a pullback per se here in 2025. I mean, there's a normalization of a new and higher baseline is the assumption. So, and again, I would say there's not a pullback because we satisfied the surge in demand in Q4, that was the surge. Right? So that was the peak. And then if the, I guess, if you want to say there's a pullback, it's the new and higher baseline assumption for 2025. You know, I think maybe the one notable point with that, it's not necessarily a home standby point to make, but a portable generator point to make, which is we saw a lot of portable generators in Q4. Our guidance does not assume major events. So therefore, you know, we have a tough comp in Q4 that won't repeat. So that has the effect of kind of dampening, you know, residential growth rates for the full year. That's in the guidance. And that is in the guidance. So just to be clear on that, I just wanted to level set. And then I think your question on close rates, you know, again, we've seen close rates compress, as I said in my prepared remarks, historically, when we get these large, you know, surges in demand for consultations or quotations for the products. You know, projects, they tend to take a little longer to close, and they don't close at quite the rate because the markets are inundated with those. So it just takes time for those quotes to mature. And so we think that the close rates will start to rebound here in 2025. You know, your commentary around testing and pricing, I mean, we are doing a lot of things behind the scenes, under the covers, to see what we can do to, you know, find an inflection point in close rates, either to get close rates to improve faster or just to have them improve overall. One of the things that we think is a needle mover in close rates is consumer financing. We've seen continued uptake in consumer financing as a percentage of all deals. We think that there's more room to do more there, and we are working with our partner Synchrony on different programs. We're looking at other options that are there on how we can be more creative and more aggressive with consumer financing because we have seen a high correlation between projects that have consumer financing as a component and better close rates. So we think that that's something that is going to be a continued area of focus for us in 2025.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Kris for closing remarks.

I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter results were ahead of our previous expectations as elevated power outage activity drove a return to robust growth in overall net sales and strong execution helped to deliver significant margin expansion. The recent increase in outage activity pushed year-to-date power outage hours through September to the highest level since we began tracking this data in 2010. As a result of the third quarter outperformance and the higher-than-expected outage activity, specifically the impact of Hurricane Helene and Hurricanes Milton, we are raising our 2024 outlook. Year-over-year, overall net sales in the quarter increased approximately 10% to $1.2 billion. Residential product sales increased 28% from the prior year due to accelerating demand for home standby and portable generators in the quarter. Global C&I product sales decreased 15% from a strong prior year as CapEx spending for U.S.-based rental, telecom and beyond standby products remained lower in the quarter and as market conditions further weakened in Europe. These softer end market conditions were partially offset by continued growth in shipments to our domestic industrial distributors as we continue to reduce our lead times. Additionally, favorable sales mix, lower input and logistics costs and improved production efficiencies drove significant expansion in gross and adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter, with gross margins reaching their highest level since the third quarter of 2010. This margin expansion, together with our returned to overall net sales growth demonstrates the earnings power here at Generac as we continue to execute our strategic vision. Home standby shipments in the quarter increased at a high 20% rate from the prior year as a result of the elevated outage activity. Outage hours during the third quarter were at their highest quarterly level since the fourth quarter of 2012 and drove home consultations to an all-time quarterly record and continued to be strong in October due to the combined impacts of Hurricane Helen and Milton. Consistent with historical trends following periods of elevated outage activity, close rates have moved lower relative to the first half of 2024. This expected compression in close rates is expected to be temporary as our dealer network absorbs the rapid increase in home consultations and as we anticipate a return to the longer-term trend of improving close rates over time. We continue to invest heavily in lead optimization, sales to enhancements and improved lead nurturing practices to help improve the longer-term trajectory of close rates. We ended the third quarter with our residential dealer count at approximately 9,100, an increase of 400 dealers from the prior year with notable growth in Texas. We expect our dealer count to grow further in the regions recently impacted by severe weather, which not only helps drive overall category awareness but this expansion in distribution also plays a critical role in supporting a new and higher baseline level of demand for home standby generators going forward. Our aligned contractor program also grew during the quarter and is quickly becoming an important new element of our distribution network particularly with the additional installation bandwidth they provide. Aligned contractors, which now number over 2,000, purchase products through our wholesale channel partners and have access to several important sales and service tools. The scale of our installation network, including dealers and non-dealer contractors is an important advantage for Generac, particularly following accelerations in demand as we have seen in recent months. Activations or installations of home standby generators returned to year-over-year growth in the third quarter, driven by strength in the South Central region, and to a lesser extent, the Northeast and Southeast regions. Activations have continued to increase early in the fourth quarter, supporting our expectations for ongoing growth throughout through year-end despite a strong prior year comparison. With unmatched scale in this industry, we are uniquely positioned to meet the rapid increase in homeowner demand for residential backup power. In addition to our scale and logistics capabilities, our industry-leading distribution network and scalable call centers provide 24/7 consumer support and service to homeowners in their time of need. We also have unique marketing capabilities with the resources and capacity to drive additional awareness of our products and generate sales leads for our distribution partners, both within the impacted regions and more broadly across the nation. Additionally, we are further ramping our home standby production rates and have increased hiring in our Whitewater, Wisconsin and Trenton, South Carolina plants to meet the elevated demand levels we're seeing after Helen and Milton. Given our prior investment in additional home standby manufacturing capacity, we have been able to increase -- to accelerate production at a much quicker pace. In fact, as a result of these investments and the tremendous effort of our teams, we expect to ship approximately $200 million of incremental home standby and portable generators in 2024 related to the impact of the major hurricanes in the second half of the year. The combination of Hurricanes Helen and Milton is also expected to result in higher levels of awareness for backup power longer term as homeowners and businesses look for solutions as protection against power outages. With a nationwide home standby penetration rate at only approximately 6% and the combined penetration rate of the states recently impacted by severe hurricane activity being slightly below that level, we believe there is significant runway for future growth in the category as the mega trend around lower power quality continues to play out. Demand for portable generators also surged in the quarter as a result of the dramatic increase in power outage activity over the last four months with third quarter shipments increasing at a very strong year-over-year rate. These products not only provide an essential solution for any homeowners and emergencies, but they also often serve as an introduction for most first-time buyers to the backup power market helping to drive Generac brand awareness. In addition to the recent storm-driven benefit, we are leveraging our product breadth and our ability to react to sharp demand increases to further expand our relationships with the major retailers that serve as primary distribution channel partners for portable generators. Now moving to our Residential Energy Technology Products & Solutions. Our energy storage system sales benefited from initial shipments associated with the previously awarded Department of Energy Grand in Puerto Rico. This program is accelerating as we enter 2025 and provides favorable top line momentum, particularly with the upcoming commercial launch of our next-generation power cell energy storage system that we introduced at in September. PWRcell 2 it includes important upgrades over our previous generation of storage products with PWRcell 2 positioned as the market leader in storage capacity per cabinet, while also delivering improved continuous and peak power output. The AC coupled PWRcell 2 also brings additional flexibility, including an improved retrofit installation experience and seamless generator integration with both home standby and portable generators as well as a differentiated user interface through our ecobee platform. The introduction of the PWRcell 2 Series marks a key milestone for the company as we believe we are building a unique energy management ecosystem for the market, centered around the ecobee Smart Home Energy Hub and focused on both resiliency and energy savings. Additionally, as we accelerate our efforts in expanding and engaging our channel partners for these products over the coming quarters, we expect to further leverage our expertise in building and developing distribution, lead generation via direct-to-consumer marketing and our brand strength. In addition to growth in our clean energy storage solutions, our team at ecobee continues to execute very well, driving growth and significant gross margin expansion from the prior year, while also adding new products and partnerships. We believe ecobee's market share continues to grow as a result of these initiatives, building on the current installed base of more than 4 million connected homes. We see the intelligent HVAC control that ecobee provides within our energy management ecosystem as a meaningful differentiator, and we are working towards similar capabilities for EV charging management through our partnership with Wallbox. Switching gears now to our C&I product category. As previously mentioned, global C&I product sales declined 15% from the prior year. Shipments to our North American industrial distributor channel, again, grew at a robust rate in the third quarter, and quoting activity has remained resilient. Although our operational execution has allowed us to reduce lead times, and customer project time lines have extended more recently, and we will be monitoring these trends closely as we head into 2025. As expected, shipments to national telecom and rental equipment customers declined in the quarter from the prior year period. While we expect that our sales to the telecom market have bottomed, we believe demand for -- from our rental equipment customers will likely remain softer in the coming quarters. Despite the cyclical weakness we've experienced in 2024, we continue to view both the telecom and rental categories as long-term growth opportunities, given the mission-critical wireless networks and infrastructure-related projects that our products support. Shipments of our natural gas generators for use and beyond standby applications also declined during the quarter from a very strong prior year comparable period. End market activity remains subdued, but we are optimistic regarding the longer-term prospects for these applications and adjacent projects due to the supporting mega trends of lower power quality and higher power prices. We continue to develop a growing pipeline for our C&I battery energy storage systems or BES, as well as our multi-asset microgrid offerings, which often include traditional generator products as part of these solutions. In early August, we acquired Agito, a leading provider of microgrid controllers. This small but strategically important deal follows our recent acquisition of Sun Grid's C&I best product offering and brings us important technical capabilities that enable end users to coordinate, optimize and monitor multiple energy assets from a single interface. Agito also brings commercial synergies, given its strong reputation in the C&I microgrid space. By leveraging these capabilities, Generac was selected for negotiations by the Department of Energy to receive a grant of $50 million to deploy microgrid solutions across approximately 100 California water utility sites. The total investment from the DOE grant and water utilities, inclusive of all hardware components, installation costs and community benefits associated with the project is expected to be approximately $100 million. These microgrids will also form virtual power plants capable of delivering critical grid support during times of stress. We believe this award provides important validation of our strategic vision for energy technology within the C&I product category and has the potential to serve as a successful proof point for similar applications across the country. Internationally, total sales decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower intercompany shipments from our Mexican operations to the telecom market in the U.S. as well as a decline in portable generator and C&I product sales in Europe. Our international results continue to be impacted by varying market conditions around the globe as softness in Europe in the third quarter was partially offset by growth in other key regions, most notably Latin America. Adjusted EBITDA margins have been impacted by this decline in shipment volumes, but as we execute on our global growth initiatives, we expect to drive continued improved profitability over time in this important segment of our business. In closing this morning, our third quarter outperformance and increased 2024 outlook highlight our strong execution alongside the mega trends that support our long-term growth expectations. Significant margin expansion and robust free cash flow generation thus far in 2024, have helped to enable our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. I also want to take a moment to thank the teams here at Generac that have been executing our rapid response to the significant increase in power outage activity over the last several months. Our operations, supply chain and customer support teams have been working tirelessly in response to Hurricanes Beryl, Helen and Milton. I'm incredibly proud of our team's efforts, particularly those of our field service field service storm response teams that travel directly into the areas impacted by these events to provide vital boots on the ground support to customers and distribution partners. As power outages have steadily trended higher over the last 30 years, the need for continuous and reliable sources of power is growing due to the increasingly electrified and connected nature of our homes, businesses and our transportation. These electrification trends together with the adoption of artificial intelligence and the reindustrialization of North America are driving expectations for power demand or load growth far beyond what has been seen in the last two decades. At the same time, renewable intermittent generation sources are being prioritized. We expect that these secular trends will drive grid-related supply-demand imbalances ultimately resulting in lower power quality and higher power prices for all ratepayers. By building on our well-established resiliency value proposition with solutions that optimize for efficiency, consumption, cost and comfort, we are confident that Generac is uniquely positioned to help home and business owners overcome the challenges of the evolving electrical grid. I'll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on the third quarter results and our increased outlook for 2024. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at third quarter 2024 results in more detail. Net sales were $1.17 billion during the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $1.07 billion in the prior year third quarter. The combination of contributions from recent acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had a slight net positive impact on revenue during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the third quarter by product class. Residential product sales increased 28% to $723 million as compared to $565 million in the prior year. This robust growth was driven by a significant power outage -- the significant power outage activity during the quarter due to Hurricanes Beryl and Helene, resulting in a high 20% increase in shipments of home standby generators and very strong growth for portable generators domestically. In addition, sales of residential energy technology solutions were higher during the quarter as we experienced growth in both our clean energy and ecobee product offerings. Commercial and industrial product sales for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 15% to $328 million as compared to $385 million in the prior year quarter, including a slight positive impact from the combination of contributions from acquisitions and unfavorable foreign currency. The core sales decline was due to the expected weakness in domestic shipments for telecom, national equipment rental and beyond standby applications as well as softer market conditions in Europe. This was partially offset by a robust increase in C&I product shipments through our domestic industrial distributor channel and growth in certain other international markets. Net sales for other products and services increased slightly to $123 million as compared to $121 million in the prior year quarter as strength in domestic service parts, accessories and deferred warranty revenue was partially offset by lower industrial project services revenue. Gross profit margin was 40.2% compared to 35.1% in the prior year third quarter, primarily due to favorable sales mix, given stronger home standby shipments, lower input and logistics costs and improved production efficiencies within our home standby manufacturing facilities. Third quarter gross margins were the highest we've seen in any quarter since 2010 and also exceeded our prior expectations. Operating expenses increased $33 million or 12% as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The overall growth in operating expenses was primarily due to ongoing investment in resources to drive future growth additional marketing spend to create incremental awareness for our products and higher variable expenses and incentive compensation given higher shipment volumes and profitability. These increases were partially offset by a $22 million provision for certain legal matters that was recorded in the prior year, which did not repeat in the current year period. As a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $232 million or 19.8% of net sales in the third quarter as compared to $189 million or 17.6% of net sales in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margins came in ahead of our prior expectations during the quarter as a result of the gross margin outperformance. The significant increase in adjusted EBITDA showcases the earnings power of Generac as we return to strong overall net sales growth with a robust margin profile. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 14% to $1.02 billion in the quarter as compared to $894 million in the prior year quarter, including a slight benefit from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $212 million, representing a 20.7% margin as compared to $160 million in the prior year or 17.9% of total sales. International segment total sales, which includes intersegment sales, decreased 20% to $167 million in the quarter as compared to $208 million in the prior year quarter, including a slight unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interest was $20 million or 12.2% of total sales as compared to $28 million or 13.6% of total sales in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of '24 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $114 million as compared to $60 million for the third quarter of 2023. The current year third quarter GAAP net income includes a $5.2 million gain on the change in fair value of our investment in Wallbox equity securities and warrants, which was partially offset by a $4.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to our previously announced Term Loan B refinancing. GAAP income taxes during the current year third quarter were $33 million or an effective tax rate of 22.7% as compared to $19 million or an effective tax rate of 24.3% for the prior year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by certain unfavorable discrete tax items in the prior year period, which did not repeat in the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.89 in the third quarter of '24 compared to $0.97 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $136 million in the current year quarter or $2.25 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $102 million in the prior year or $1.64 per share. Cash flow from operations in the current year third quarter was $212 million as compared to $140 million in the prior year third quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $184 million as compared to $117 million in the same quarter last year. The improvement in free cash flow was primarily driven by higher operating earnings and a greater reduction in primary working capital in the current year quarter partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures relative to the prior year. Additionally, during the third quarter, we repurchased nearly 691,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $102 million. Over the last two calendar years, we've repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at an average cost of $125 per share. There's approximately $347 million remaining under the current repurchase authorization as of September 30. As previously announced, we also deployed capital during the third quarter with an additional $35 million investment in Wallbox and the small but strategic acquisition of Agito. In addition, we made a $30 million prepayment on our term loan B credit facility in connection with the refinancing that closed on July 3. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.5 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2.1 times on an as-reported basis, a continued reduction from 2.5 times at the end of 2023. With that, I will now provide further comments on our updated outlook for 2024. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are increasing our overall outlook for the full year 2024. Given the higher than previously expected power outage activity in the Southeast region of the U.S., specifically the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We now expect overall 2024 net sales growth to be approximately 5% to 9% as compared to the prior year. This is an increase from the previously expected range of 4% to 8%. Breaking this down by product class, relative to our prior expectations, residential products are expected to increase by approximately $100 million, primarily due to incremental home standby and portable generator sales resulting from the higher power outage activity. As a result, our overall residential product sales growth is now expected to be in the high teens range on a year-over-year basis compared to our prior expectations of mid-teens increase. However, softer-than-expected market conditions within certain domestic and European end markets for our C&I and other product categories are projected to partially offset the increased residential product sales outlook. We now expect the combination of C&I and other product sales to be approximately $50 million below our prior forecast, resulting in C&I product sales now projected to be down high single digits compared to the prior year for the full year 2024. The other sales category is anticipated to be nearly flat on a year-over-year basis for the full year 2024. Our gross margin expectations for the full year '24 have also increased relative to our previous guidance due to the third quarter outperformance and higher sales mix of home standby generator is now expected in the fourth quarter. We now project gross margins to improve by approximately 450 basis points over the full year 2023, resulting in implied fourth quarter gross margins that are similar to third quarter gross margin in the 40% range. As a result of the increased outlook for gross margins, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are now expected to be approximately 17.5% to 18.5% for the full year 2024 as compared to the previous guidance range of 17% to 18%. This implies fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20%. As is our normal practice, we're also providing updated guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2024. For the full year, our GAAP effective tax rate is lower than our prior outlook now expected to be approximately 24% to 25% compared to our previous guidance range of 25% to 26%. This is expected to result in a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 24% to 24.5% in the fourth quarter. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add back items should be reflected net of tax using the 24% to 25% expected effective tax rate. As a result of lower interest rate expectations, our gross interest expense is now expected to be approximately $91 million to $93 million as compared to prior guidance of $92 million to $94 million. This guidance assumes no additional term loan or revolver principal prepayments during the year. Stock compensation is now expected to be between $50 million to $52 million for the year as compared to prior guidance of $52 million to $54 million. As a result of our share repurchases that were completed in the third quarter of 2024, our full year weighted average diluted share count is now expected to decrease to approximately 60.5 million shares as compared to prior guidance of 60.5 million to 61 million shares. Our guidance for capital expenditures as a percent of sales remains consistent at approximately 3% of sales. Depreciation expense and GAAP intangible amortization expense also remained consistent with last quarter's guidance. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion for the full year to be well above 100% as we anticipate a further reduction in working capital in the fourth quarter. This would result in free cash flow of approximately $500 million for the full year 2024 giving us significant optionality to drive further shareholder value in the future. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tommy Moll of Stephens Inc. Your question please, Tommy.
Tommy Moll: Good morning. And thank you for takin my question. I want to start on home standby. So you guided the residential revenue of high teens year-over-year now. Within that, is it safe to assume that home standby would be a little bit above and what are you assuming for activations embedded in that full year guidance? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Tommy. So yes, home standby is going to be a little bit above that 15% range. In terms of activations, we're anticipating -- we returned to growth here in the third quarter with activations. We believe that's going to accelerate, as we said in the prepared remarks this morning throughout the fourth quarter as the market digests the increase in demand here from the recent events. So again, I don't think we've given specific guidance on activations for the full year, but it is expected to be -- and again, I would remind you, we had a really strong fourth quarter last year. So it's a pretty strong comp that we're up against there on activations, but we're pretty confident given all of the signs here. We are seeing activations here early in the fourth quarter kind of pacing to where we thought they'd be.
Tommy Moll: Thanks, Aaron. As a follow-up, we haven't talked too much today about the margin impact from the energy technology investments. But I know that the intention there is for that to fade over time. And while you're not going to guide us for 2025 today, anything you can do to help frame how that margin drag could fade next year based on what you're seeing would be helpful. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean, this year, it's going to be in that 350 to 400 basis point range. It's kind of been hanging in that level. It's -- obviously, it's a high level of investment for us. As we said in the prepared remarks, we are making progress at RE plus this year, which is the renewable energy show out in Anaheim, we introduced our PWRcell 2. We had really good receptivity there. I think the idea of building out this ecosystem with the ecobee Energy Hub as we refer to it. At the center of that was incredibly well received. We think it's a differentiator in terms of the ability to control one of the heaviest loads in the home in terms of HVAC and do that in concert with energy storage and build out that ecosystem. And then as we said, doing similar things with some of the other heavier loads that present like EV charging, we just believe that that's something that's going to be really, really important going forward. And we don't think that there's really anybody else that's going to be doing it similar to us. Now as we laid out in our Investor Day last year in 2023, we still think that by the end of 2026 that we're going to be closer to breakeven. That's that we believe is still within reach for that business. And so the drag on EBITDA, again, we're not going to be able to pin down specifically next year's impact. But obviously, it's going to abate from the 350 to 400 basis point drag run rate, if you will, today, to that kind of breakeven point, which, by the way, even if we hit breakeven with that business, still going to present a drag on EBITDA margins in '26 until we get significantly to the other side of that. But we are seeing progress. We're excited about the receptivity of those products. Now we've got to do the hard work of commercializing these new products that we're bringing to market. And that's, I think, something that, again, we haven't really had with the first-generation product that we've been selling. It's been more difficult for us to make headway -- and we -- I know the teams here, the commercial teams, in particular, and energy technology are really excited to have new products to sell as we get into 2025.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas of Canaccord Genuity. Your question please, George.
George Gianarikas : Hi. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question. I'd love if you can kind of dig in a little bit as to what's happening in your European business and when you expect those trends to potentially rebound? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, George. So Europe has been kind of -- we were seeing trends earlier this year around portable generators mainly. I mean that was our -- again, we had some pretty tough comps from the prior year on the back of the Ukraine-Russia war, there were energy security issues, concerns around energy security that really drove portable generator sales higher in 2023. As we rounded 2024, those concerns after kind of a mild-ish winter, somewhat abated and we were kind of seeing struggles there. That has now expanded to include kind of the broader C&I complex of products in Europe as well. It's not all bad news for our international segment. We are seeing pockets of, I would say, surprising strength in Latin America, in particular, we've got a new team managing that business down there. I think we've done a nice job. They've done a nice job really tackling the market and improving our position there. But broader Europe, Germany in particular, I mean, if we had to kind of pin it down to a particular country, not to call anyone out here, but Germany has really been a struggle. And it's an important market for our operations there. So I think it's something that I think everybody has seen the recent headlines. Even the automotive sector, in particular, in Germany is really struggling. Volkswagen announcing their first plant closures in Germany ever in something like 84 years or something like that, I think, was the headline. So I think that it's going to be a struggle in Europe, Mainland Europe for a bit until we see maybe the economic shift happened there. Hopefully, that happens sometime in 2025. I would tell you right now, we're probably going to see -- I would expect to see maybe a recovery in C&I domestically before we see a recovery in Europe. I just say I think that maybe is how the pacing will work. We're starting to see some green shoots domestically for telecom here in the U.S. I think rental is going to remain down. We were a little bit below our guide even for the third quarter in rental. The season hasn't been as strong. It wasn't a huge miss. But I think the rental companies are taking a little bit more of a wait-and-see approach. I don't know how much of that is based on the current election environment, just getting to the other side of that, whatever party ends up being in power here, but I think there is some trepidation around CapEx spending there. And so I think Europe is going to be tough, probably for all of next year, would be my guess -- tougher anyway, again, offset by some pockets of strength in Latin America and maybe some other areas of the world.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Baird. Please go ahead, Mike.
Mike Halloran : Good morning, guys. I wasn't sure if that was lending -- you needed to hear the validation for you guys. So there's probably a couple of years to this, but could you place the activity you're seeing today in historical context, what kind of uplift are you seeing? How does that compare to history? And I'm asking from kind of two perspectives. One, your penetration and awareness is much higher in these regions today than it was then maybe less of the penetration, but certainly the awareness. And so how is that manifesting when it comes to the activity levels that you're seeing -- but then secondarily, how is that awareness impacting non-impacted regions, if that makes sense. So both how are the regions tracking? How are the other regions tracking? Is there a spillover effect in place in some historical context as well, please?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, I think it's a great question, actually. And when you put it in perspective, there's a couple of things. I think so the states that were impacted here, and I think there's 6 or 7 states that bore the brunt of Helen and Milton those states actually oddly enough, are slightly below the national average of 6% pen rate for home standby. So when we just talking HSB for a second, while they're not materially below like maybe like California as per the -- as compared to the national average, they're still below. So in terms of the upside, I think there are -- the interesting thing is we have a good dealer representation in those markets because they are markets we've sold into in the past. Obviously, Texas has had a number of high-priority events. So barrel hits -- that said, we've added a lot of dealers in Texas. We said of the 400 dealers we've added over the last year, a good chunk of those are coming out of Texas. We would expect to see in the fourth quarter dealer counts improve probably coming out of Florida and the Carolinas. Those are going to grow. But I think just going back to the core of your question, putting it in perspective, so we've always said these events are -- can provide between $50 million to $100 million impact in the current year, depending on the timing of the event, right? And so the later timing of the event in the year, the less of that $50 million to $100 million you're going to be able to get. So if you add up all 3 events that would put your range somewhere between $150 million to $300 million upside. We said that the upside we're going to experience this year is around $200 million from these events, right? So I think we're kind of right where we think we should be with some of that probably spilling over into 2025. And we've got a lot of time between now and then before we give kind of proper formal guidance around that, we're going to watch a lot of things, but we're ramping our production. So what you're going to see in Q4 based on our guidance update is really based on what we can get out of the factories in Q4. It's a combination of our supply chain in our factories. I will say this from a historical perspective, we've added a lot of capacity, right? So when we brought online Trenton, South Carolina, which is a mirror image of our Whitewater, Wisconsin facility, that really effectively doubled our HSB capacity. So our ability to ramp more quickly, I think, is important, right? So lead times today for these products are around four to eight weeks, depending on the node. And that's probably as high as they'll probably get. As we ramp our production throughout the quarter here, we think we're going to catch that. And we think we'll bring that into a more normal looking place as we get into 2025. Now that's, of course, assuming there aren't any other major events that happen, right, between now and then the -- obviously, the extreme nature of these types of events and the weather and just the rapid intensification of these hurricanes and some of the things that we're seeing in terms of the extremities of air temperature and water temperature, I think is important. So I think putting it in perspective though, we're able to ramp quicker. I think that what we've seen out of these events kind of is right down the middle of the fairway and what we would have expected. We're encouraged by the fact that we do have good dealer representation in the markets, and I think our brand is well represented in these markets as well. And you asked one other part of that question, Mike, which was the spillover effect of the areas outside of the markets impacted by this. I think interestingly enough, if you just look at October here when we look at home consultations, we're seeing a nice lift outside of those six or seven states that were impacted by these events this year. So I would say it's more broadly impacting our demand, which is great. I think, in fact, outside of Canada, I think every other region in the U.S. was an easier comp, but Canada was a tougher comp from last year. So -- but every other region so far this quarter, we saw nice growth. And in fact, I would -- just 1 last point on this. I mean, October is not done yet. We still got today to go. But October is likely to be a record month for in-home consultations for us. And that is -- I think that's an important data point as we think about not only the impact of Q4 as we've laid out here this morning, but also the impact on the continued awareness of the category. And as we kind of build that new and higher baseline for the category as we go into 2025.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond : Hey. Good morning, guys. So maybe just back on clean energy. Can you just talk about what you think is really differentiated in the new product and just the initial feedback you're getting any kind of early distribution partner wins? And just an update on the inverter intro timing?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's great, Jeff. I appreciate that. So the new product, PWRcell 2, obviously, it's basically -- it's a ground-up redesign of the platform. So the acquired platform from Pika days when we acquired that back in 2019, I believe it was. We went through kind of our ups and downs of that platform, have been working very hard over the last 1.5 years with our teams. We've invested tremendously, as you can see, obviously, the 350 to 400 basis point drag that we talked about on EBITDA margins. It's a heavy lift here. But the differentiating factors of that platform. So our focus -- and this is really going back to the first-generation product, we really positioned ourselves from a storage standpoint of being focused on resiliency. The product, of course, can take care of the time shifting needs that you need when you've got solar attached to it and you're trying to store product from a savings standpoint. But what we really felt that people wanted, what homeowners want is if they have a battery, they want it to last some period of time if they do have an outage. And so the first generation product was the largest capacity battery in market. The second-generation product here will remain the largest capacity battery in product. But we've also done some other cool things to focus on some other important upgrades there around -- just around improved continuous and peak power output, which allows you to cover more of your house at once when there is an outage, so you're not limited to having to make choices about what you get -- what's backed up by the storage device and what's not. And that's kind of at the storage level, right? So that's that product, I'll call those the product enhancements. I think more broadly, though, Jeff, is really the expansion of this concept of an ecosystem, and you'll see some other companies going after this, but I think this was core to our thesis in acquiring ecobee is the technology that ecobee brings in not only the HMI, the human interface, the UX portion of the device, right? They've got a great kind of front end in terms of the user experience the app experience, the device experience, it's high end, it's premium. And it's a truly smart thermostat. There's a lot of capability within that device. We're going to leverage the capability within that device to control the entire ecosystem and create an experience for the end customer that really takes, I think, not only savings but takes resiliency to the next level, right? So the most prime example we can share with you there is if you take the example of you have an outage, a utility outage. And if you have the ecobee thermostat/Energy Hub at the center of your ecosystem, you have a PWRcell 2 device. You have a generator perhaps, you maybe have an EV charger from Wallbox. You have all of these devices that are now going to be integrated onto the platform, the ecobee Smart Hub is going to be making choices for you about how to preserve the maximum amount of duration for your battery. So it might if it's a cold day, it might turn down your thermostat a few degrees or if it's a hot day, it might turn up thermostat a few days, giving you a couple of precious more hours of backup -- and you don't even have to kind of be aware of that, it will obviously have work within parameters of comfort that you've set or that it knows. It's learned from your behaviors. But it also can make those choices. If you're not home, it can definitely adjust the thermostat to a greater degree, again, to preserve that duration. It can make sure that the EV charging system is not charging your vehicle during an outage, right? You don't want to take the precious energy that's stored in your power cell system, you don't want to use that to put that into your vehicle during an outage, you want to preserve that. So these different kind of scenarios that are going to play out and the complexities around those scenarios that will play out. And as the ecosystem grows with more content, I think it's going to become even more clearly evident how important that is to have a central brain. In effect, what we're creating here is a mini micro grid. It's a personal microgrid for your home, right, with a multitude of assets that you can tie into that micro grid but that micro grid can be optimized for resiliency, it can be optimized for cost. It can be optimized for conservation, for comfort, right? So all of those different settings can be prioritized and those prioritizations can change. So I think we demonstrated that at RE+ in a very visceral way in our booth, in our show booth. And I think that, that was, for me, it was an eye-opening experience, I went to the show in engaging with customers and distribution partners there, they really understood very quickly the value of that. And I think that, that is going to be for us. I think that's going to set us apart -- you couple that with our brand and then you put together with that our kind of our marketing capabilities here and our ability to build and develop distribution. And I really like how we're positioned as we go forward, timing on the products real quick. So PWRcell 2, we were going to be shipping product here. We wanted to be in market at the very end of the fourth quarter. That's probably shifted about six weeks into February a little bit. Four to six weeks. I think we're just putting the finishing touches on our customer field trials there and hope to be in market kind of in that early to mid-Q1, and then the micro is still slated for early second half of next year. So that product is pacing ahead as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab of William Blair. Your question please Brian.
Brian Drab : Hi. Thanks for takin my question. I'm just looking at the timing of the hurricanes you know, Helene and Melton. I mean, there's still obviously significant outages in several states, even in mid-October. And there's a cycle time to getting these home standbys installed, obviously, and getting to the dealers and all those conversations need to happen. I'm just trying to figure out why even half of the demand related to those recent hurricanes would be fulfilled in 2024. It seems like this is -- I mean, you've only had like a couple of weeks since these people even got their power back on. I don't know, it just feels like just the beginning of a wave of demand rather than you're kind of making it sound like, I think, like a lot of it will be satisfied in 2024?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, I think that's a great question, Brian. I think it's 1 that bears a little bit further explanation. I mean, clearly -- so at least here in 2024, our ability to fulfill that demand is going to be gated, as I said, by what we can do from a supply chain and operations standpoint. And that's with a pretty significant ramp. We actually started ramping after barrel in early July. Yes, that was early July. So we got the benefit of that. We kind of got ahead of it a little bit. In terms of prioritizing with our supply chain, both portables, kind of getting our portable generator inventories in a better place ahead of the season and then obviously, with the home standby ramp, we were starting to -- we were able to begin execution on that maybe a little earlier because of that early season event. I think that put us on alert that and obviously, all the predictions were for a pretty active season. And then nothing really happened after that until we got Helene in late September. So I think it was a matter of being able to get that ramp going and now we're going to continue in the back half of the year. The question of whether the demand -- I think the important thing to note here is, consistent with prior events, we've always seen a surge in demand followed by kind of a pullback to a new and higher baseline level, right? I think the question is the surge in demand, how long does it last? And what is the pullback -- when does the pullback happen and where does that new and higher baseline level kind of emerge. And those are kind of an answer yet at this point, and I think we're not prepared, at least on this call, to do that because to your point, to an effect, it is early, right? I mean, it is -- we're not even done with October, and we're still talking about how we've seen IHCs, this will be our strongest month ever with IHC power outages since we started tracking them the most outage hours that we've seen from an impact standpoint, certainly going back since 2010. So I think it is something that when we think about the future demand, we want to see how things play out here for the balance of the year. Again, it's an election cycle year. We've got an interest rate environment that's higher today than maybe historically, when we've been in the category, I don't know that we've had a number of -- I don't know that we've had very good proxy periods to kind of compare it to there. So in terms of the impact on kind of how people think about a project for their home, there's a lot of homeowners, I think that might tell you they feel a little bit stuck in their current home because of where their current mortgage rates are at. So as that shifts and it hasn't shifted materially yet, even with a 50 basis point decline from the Fed hasn't really read through completely to a decrease in 30-year mortgage rates. So at least not to that extent. So we're watching that and we'll see what -- where that goes as well because I think that's another kind of factor as we think about this. But look, these are -- it's an area of the country, the Southeast, that I think is understanding the importance of needing a resiliency plan. And I think our products are the right answer for that. It's just a question of timing, again, around kind of that demand peak, where it happens, when it happens, how far does it come off of that peak and where does that new and higher level of baseline demand emerge.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your question please, Jerry.
Jerry Revich : Yes, hi. Good morning, Aaron. Aaron, York, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the level of in-home consultations that you're seeing based on web traffic. It looks like you're setting records in terms of interest in your products. Is that translating into home consultations? And with the revised residential standby guidance, it looks like you're not counting on a sequential pickup in the standby business 4Q versus I'm wondering, is that right? And can you talk about that because normally, seasonally, you do see higher shipment rates 4Q versus 3Q?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Jerry. On the IHC, yes, I mean, again, October here, we're not completed yet. We got one more day, but we're going to be at a record level. And we think that, that -- when you look at 3Q, as we mentioned, that was...
York Ragen: How portable they're going to go down Q3 to Q4 and home Sam's going to go up as we ramp production course is sort of matched by the portable decline.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So home standby is going to increase and portable is obviously, unless we have so a lot of -- we sold a lot of portable generators. Frankly, even if we have another major event here anytime soon our inventory levels are quite low. So we're in the middle of replenishing those stock levels. So it's really a shift between higher home standby lower portables for Q4 when you're going trying to compare the Q3 to Q4 run rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kashy Harrison of Piper Sandler. Your line is open, Kashy.
Kashy Harrison : Good morning, guys. And thank you for taking my question. I'll keep in mind to the C&I side of the business. Can you help us think through whether the implied 4Q C&I numbers have essentially stabilized or whether based on what you're seeing on cycle times in the U.S. than Europe and rental and everything else, that there could be some more risk? I'm just trying to get a sense of if the business has in aggregate bottomed by your measures? Or if you think there could still be some softness as we think about the coming quarters qualitatively?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Kashy, thanks for that. I appreciate the question. So I think as we said on the last call, actually, we kind of viewed Q2, Q3 is the bottom for telecom. We don't see that pulling back. In fact, we're seeing some green shoots and Q4 would contemplate the guidance we gave this morning would contemplate that, that actually improved slightly Q3 and Q4. I think on the rental market side, as I said in a previous question, we actually saw that be a little weaker than we would have hoped in Q3. So normally, that's a little bit of more of a seasonal business for us. We see lighting towers from that season is when we kind of get to this time of year, that has not played out. Again, it's not materially off of our expectations, but it was disappointing to see kind of maybe further weakness than we expected there. But it's -- I think in terms of bottoming out, it feels like that is probably kind of maybe where we're at. I just -- the question -- the fundamental question on rental is kind of where does that go kind of next year, right? And I think our views on rental right now without additional kind of direct guidance from the major rental companies that we serve. We haven't been given any kind of guide yet on next year's CapEx spend in our categories. But we would believe at this point that's probably going to remain pretty muted throughout 2025. I think telecom, as we said, those green shoots, we're hoping to see continued improvement. I think when you think about our core industrial distributor channel, we've been working to catch our lead times. We've been executing quite well operationally, but we've been seeing book-to-bill rates that are under 1. And that -- so as we catch that backlog and we've reduced our lead times, that could be an area where we see that pull back a little bit. Now quotings remain resilient. So the challenge we're seeing is that the quote to order time line is pushing out. So we're seeing projects get delayed. And this is something that can happen in this part of the cycle, especially if you have high rates persisting. So perhaps if maybe the uncertainty around the election is taken away, and we see rates continue to come down as they are projected to come down into next year. It might be a very temporary thing that we see there. It might just be related more to us catching our backlog and bringing lead times down. I think for us, one of the other fundamental questions is Europe, although I think when we think about that, we have, again, Mainland Europe, I think that doesn't feel very good. But I see other markets outside of that, that we've been seeing pretty decent -- actually nice growth in Latin America, as I said, some in the Middle East. We've seen a little bit there. And we have some new products coming to market next year. We've got some new partnerships there in that business. So I would like to believe, at least kind of the early read here is, I think we've maybe hopefully found the bottom in terms of our European operations, our international operations. Even if Europe may soften further, I think that will be, at this point, at least fully offset or more than offset perhaps by some of the other regions of the world where we have operations, and we have opportunities.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro of Stifel. Your question please, Stephen.
Stephen Gengaro : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So a quick one for me. When we think about the margin progression that you've seen and relative maybe to the prior guidance, but even just relative throughout the year. Can you talk about or give us some sense for how much is mix and how much is sort of cost out and efficiency gains that you've been able to achieve?
York Ragen: Yes. Stephen, this is York. So gross margins improved roughly 5% year-over-year. We've been seeing that for quite some time now over a number of quarters. This particular quarter, I'd say about say, 40% to 50% of that 5% was mix related. So obviously, as home standby generators increase in mix, we're going to get a nice bump in margins. So that means around 50% to 60% was price cost. So we're still on a year-over-year basis, still seeing the benefits of lower input costs coming through the P&L as we turn through that higher cost of inventory or as we sell through that in the past, and now we're -- now that's not running through the P&L. And then logistics costs, we continue to do a good job in terms of bringing material to the plants and getting out to our customers. So we continue to run our factories more efficiently as -- in particular, the home standby volume picks up. So price cost has been favorable for a number of quarters, continues to be in Q3, like I said, around 50% to 60% of that year-over-year increases price cost. What's interesting is if you look from, say, like now look ahead from Q3 to Q4 now sequentially now, not talking year-over-year but sequentially. I'd probably say a lot of that price cost is now running through our P&L here in Q3. I mean we carded, what, 40% gross margins in Q3. That's the best we've seen since 2010. So we're feeling good in terms of where we're at from our gross margin profile and that we believe will continue into Q4. And so I'd say, sequentially, the price/cost scenario has played out, but year-over-year, we'll still see benefits.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your question please, Keith.
Keith Housum : Great thanks. Appreciate. Good morning, guys. In terms of like the power outages and the driving of demand, all focuses have been on HSB. But can you touch on, is there any opportunity for growth within C&I or the beyond standby batteries in terms of those guys benefiting from when you have these massive storms come through?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Keith, and I appreciate you bringing that up because I probably should have mentioned that when we're talking about C&I on one of the last questions. Absolutely. When we get outage events, I mean, longer-term trends, the outages drive awareness, whether you're a small business owner or whether you are a wireless telephone network operator that has thousands and thousands of sites, hundreds of thousands of sites, you realize very quickly if you haven't invested in a backup plan, you realize the impact that can have on your operations and on your revenue streams on your continuity of operations, maybe spoilage of inventory that can happen. And so we just -- we also know that historically, for us, and when we look at our business, that usually is more of a delayed reaction. And the point -- the reason for that really is that in the business world, those are business decisions. They're usually CapEx budgets. There are approval processes. It takes time to get those projects going. So we would expect, as historically would follow on is sometime late -- kind of in that 4-quarter cycle basis, you would start to see some demand start to pull through from those events directly related to those events in the affected areas and perhaps indirectly affected -- indirectly impacted areas outside of that, when you're talking about a national telecom operator who is now going to allocate more dollars in the budget process for hardening of networks, right? So they put more dollars aside for purchases of generators or storage devices. Those things definitely are things that we see historically. And that also, I think, could be an offset to any potential longer term weakness in kind of the core industrial C&I markets that we're currently seeing. We think those are fleeting. We've seen these cycles before, and I think you bring up a really good point. As soon as you get kind of an active period of events like this, that definitely gets people on notice and brings it more to the forefront from a business planning standpoint, from a disaster planning standpoint, continuity of operations ending plan regulatory standpoint, all of those things come to the front of the line.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Levy of Truist Securities. Your question please, Jordan.
Jordan Levy : Morning all. And thanks for all the detail. We've talked before about the percentage of the HSB category that finance or I think your program with Synchrony. I think you said it's around 20% of dealer network sales or so. I'm just curious how you think about the potential to ever kind of expand that financing optionality on HSB as more customers start to think through power quality and outage activity sort of issues?
York Ragen: Yes. No, this is York, Jordan. Definitely having financing is -- I mean, price in general is always a barrier to driving close rates higher financing as a way to sort of break-through that challenge that you might have in terms of closing a deal. I know for a fact in 2025, we're going to be doing some -- we're going to be ramping up that -- the financing initiatives throughout the dealer channel, and it's going to be a big focus throughout 2025, just like it has been in 2024 here. So yes, no, it's -- I agree -- we agree with you that, that will be an important aspect to trying to drive close rates higher.
Operator: I would now like to turn the conference back to Kris Rosemann for closing remarks. Sir?
Kris Rosemann: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings results with you in mid-February. Thank you again, and goodbye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2024 Generac Holdings Inc. Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Kris Rosemann. Please go ahead.
Kris Rosemann: Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Kris. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were ahead of previous expectations for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS driven by lower input costs and operating expenses relative to our prior forecast. We are raising our 2024 full-year outlook this morning as a result of the recent increase in power outage activity, including the impact of Hurricane Beryl. Year-over-year, overall net sales in the second quarter were nearly flat compared to the prior year at $998 million. Residential product sales increased 8% from the prior year due to strong growth in home standby generator shipments. Global C&I product sales decreased 10% from a strong prior-year second quarter as softness in the telecom and rental markets was partially offset by an increase in shipments to our industrial distributor customers. Additionally, gross and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded significantly from the second quarter of 2023 as a result of favorable sales mix and the realization of lower input costs. Home standby shipments were in line with our prior expectations during the quarter, increasing at a mid-teens rate from the softer prior-year period that included a meaningful headwind from excess field inventory levels. Power outage activity during the second quarter was above the long-term baseline average primarily due to strong storms in May that impacted multiple markets in Texas. Early in the third quarter, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in the Houston area, driving year-to-date power outage activity well above the long-term baseline average and increasing demand for home standby and portable generators. After a slow start to the year, home consultations in the second quarter increased modestly over the prior year and grew at a strong rate on a sequential basis. More importantly, home consultation activity increased significantly during the month of July due to Hurricane Beryl. Additionally, close rates have improved during the first-half of 2024 as we continue to execute initiatives to improve sales lead conversion, including data-driven lead optimization practices, sales tool enhancements, and improved lead nurturing practices. Although we expect close rates to improve over time, they have historically moderated immediately following a major outage event in the affected region. We remain focused on making further investments to bring new and broader demographic categories into the home standby generator market and increase engagement with our end customers, particularly in regions that have not experienced material outage activity in recent periods. We ended the second quarter with our residential dealer count at approximately 8,900, an increase of 200 dealers from the end of 2023. We also continue to strengthen our relationships with non-dealer contractors as we further grew our Aligned Contractor Program, an effort that helps us expand our installation bandwidth while allowing contractors to purchase product through their preferred channel. We view our dealer and aligned contractor networks as an important competitive advantage for our business. And we continue to invest heavily in these relationships with a focus on further developing tools and resources to optimize the selling, service, and installation capabilities of our distribution partners. Activations or installations of home standby generators were down modestly during the first-half of 2024, reflecting the lower power outage environment from late 2023 through the first quarter of 2024. However, activations have returned to strong year-over-year growth in the month of July, and we expect continued growth in installations as we move through the seasonally stronger second-half and impacted by the recent increase in outage activity. As the clear leader in residential backup power, we are uniquely positioned to respond to major outage events such as Hurricane Beryl. Our ability to leverage our strong financial position to invest inventory for storm response combined with our logistics capabilities allow us to rapidly deploy product into outage-impacted areas. Our industry-leading distribution network and our scalable call centers provide 24-7 consumer support and service in our customers' time of need. We are also increasing our advertising spend in the aftermath of the storm to leverage our expertise in marketing to drive awareness for our products and generate sales leads for our distribution partners, not only in the impacted region but also more broadly across the nation. Simultaneously, we are ramping up our efforts to increase sales and installation bandwidth by adding more dealers and aligned contractors to our distribution network. Finally, we are increasing our production rates for home standby generators to respond to increases in demand for these products as we have built our supply chain and operating footprint capacities to allow for the rapid expansion of output to respond quickly to market changes. As a result, we are raising our overall 2024 outlook due to anticipated higher demand for home standby and portable generators following the recent increase in power outage activity. The effect of Hurricane Beryl is also expected to drive higher levels of awareness for backup power longer-term as home and business owners seek protection from future power outages. With only approximately 6% penetration of the addressable market of homes in the U.S., we believe there are significant opportunities to further grow the residential standby generator market. Now moving to our residential energy technology products and solutions, the overall market for residential solar and storage continues to be negatively impacted from structural changes to California's net metering program as well as higher borrowing costs which will continue to weigh on 2024's results for these products. Although market conditions are challenging in the near-term, we recently announced the execution of the previously awarded grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to provide energy storage systems to Puerto Rico with funding from the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund. The grant provides for up to $200 million in project funding over a five-year term, which is an increase from the $100 million initially awarded when we announced our participation in the program in the fourth quarter of last year. The first shipments of energy storage systems for this program are expected to begin later this year, with the bulk of program installations occurring in 2025 and 2026. Ecobee continues to execute well, gaining market share and driving robust margin improvement over the prior year. Ecobee's connected homes count is now approaching four million, and services attach rates continue to increase with strong growth in both energy services and home monitoring services. Importantly, we are leveraging ecobee's expertise in developing hardware and software experiences that are intelligent and intuitive as their development teams are leading our efforts around building the common platform that will serve as the heart of the Generac residential energy ecosystem. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we also agreed to make an incremental $35 million minority investment in Wallbox, allowing for the expansion of our commercial agreement globally to include both residential and commercial EV charging solutions across our distribution networks. Additionally, we have aligned on a software development approach that will deepen the integration of Wallbox EV chargers with our dealer and customer platforms. We believe that the ability to manage EV charging as part of our residential and C&I energy technology ecosystems will become increasingly important as growing electric vehicle penetration and the resulting increased demand for electricity have a rising impact on home and business owners as well as grid operators around the world. As we continue to build out our energy technology solutions, we believe that the combination of our internal initiatives, strategic investments and core competencies will allow us to effectively compete in these large and growing markets. As we bring increasingly competitive solutions to market over the coming quarters, starting with our next-generation energy storage system later this year, we will accelerate our efforts in expanding and engaging our distribution network. This will allow us to gain market share by further leveraging our expertise in providing superior channel and customer support, as well as our proficiency in delivering qualified sales leads to distribution partners and our brand strength. We believe our unique and comprehensive approach to residential energy management will provide further differentiation as we develop the smart energy home of the future. Switching now to our C&I product category. As previously expected, global C&I product sales declined 10% from the prior year, driven by a decrease in shipments to both domestic telecom and rental customers. This decline was partially offset by continued growth with our North American industrial distributors, as shipments to this channel again grew at a robust rate in the second quarter and quoting activity remained resilient. We continue to expand our market share, primarily due to our ongoing focus on operational execution, leading to reduced product lead times and further optimization of our domestic distributor channel. This includes additional investment in certain territories where we believe we have a potential to improve our share regionally through M&A or further development of our independent distribution partners. As expected, shipments to National Telecom and rental equipment customers declined in the quarter from the strong prior year period, and we continue to believe these end markets will remain soft for the balance of the year. However, we see long-term growth opportunities in both markets despite the near term cyclical weakness. We believe the critical need for future infrastructure projects provide substantial runway for growth in the rental channel. In the market for backup power for telecom applications, our long-term growth expectations are supported by the secular trend of growing global tower and network hub counts and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications and services that require significantly greater power reliability. As previously announced in late June, we acquired the C&I Battery Energy Storage System product offering from SunGrid Solutions located in Cambridge, Canada. This small, but strategic acquisition brings us engineering and manufacturing expertise to better serve the growing market for behind the meter energy storage solutions for commercial and industrial applications, including where it is deployed as a critical component in multi-asset micro grids. We have an expanding pipeline of commercial projects in which we expect to provide stationary battery storage alongside our traditional generator product offerings. And additionally, we're seeing a number of projects in which EV charging equipment is also included. We believe our commercial agreement with Wallbox is important to helping expand our opportunity to win these and other similar projects. As we leverage our leading position in natural gas generators and our newly acquired capabilities in energy storage with the SunGrid acquisition, we believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver comprehensive solutions for the developing microgrid market, which is focused on providing C&I customers with important energy resiliency as well as lower overall energy costs. Internationally, total sales were lower year-over-year, primarily related to declines in intercompany shipments from our Mexican operations to the telecom market in the U.S. as well as lower shipments in Europe, most notably for portable generators. Increases in shipments to other key regions, such as Latin America and India, partially offset the softness. As previously discussed, our expanded agreement with Wallbox also includes incremental collaboration in international end markets. This is another example of our longer term international growth strategy, as we bring a broad portfolio of solutions to more markets around the world, building on the strong track record of growth and margin expansion in our international segment over the past several years. In closing, this morning, our second quarter margin outperformance and increased 2024 outlook highlight the fundamental momentum occurring within our business. Significant year-over-year margin expansion and robust free cash flow generation in the first-half of 2024 have supported our continued investments in accelerating our Powering a Smarter World Enterprise strategy, while also enhancing shareholder value through continued share repurchases. Once again, Hurricane Beryl highlighted the vulnerability of the electrical grid and the need for resiliency. Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane to form in the Atlantic on record, providing further evidence that the changing weather patterns continue to threaten the continuity of power that we are increasingly dependent on. Additionally, the rapid adoption of intermittent generation sources and growing demand from electrification trends, as well as the adoption of artificial intelligence are providing additional stresses on our nation's aging power grid. These secular trends will continue to manifest in lower power quality and higher power prices for all rate payers in the decades to come. By expanding on Generac's core resiliency value proposition and helping optimize for efficiency, consumption, cost, and comfort, we remain confident that our products and solutions are uniquely capable of helping home and business owners solve the challenges around resiliency and rising utility cost. I'll now turn the call to York to provide additional details on our second quarter results and our increased outlook for 2024. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at second quarter 2024 results in more detail, net sales were $998 million during the second quarter of 2024 as compared to $1 billion in the prior year second quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had a slight positive impact on revenue during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the second quarter by product class, residential product sales increased 8% to $538 million as compared to $499 million in the prior year. Growth in residential product sales was primarily driven by a mid-teens increase in shipments of home standby generators and strong growth for portable generators domestically. This was partially offset by a decrease in portable generator shipments in Europe given a strong prior year comparison, ongoing softness in the domestic clean energy market, and lower chore product sales. Commercial and industrial product sales for the second quarter of 2024 decreased 10% to $344 million as compared to $384 million in the prior year quarter. Foreign currency and acquisitions contributed approximately 1% growth in the quarter. The core sales decline was primarily due to the expected weakness in sales to our domestic telecom and national equipment rental customers. This was partially offset by a robust increase in C&I product shipments through our domestic industrial distributor channel and growth in certain other key international markets. Net sales for other products and services decreased slightly to $116 million as compared to $117 million in the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin was 37.6% compared to 32.8% in the prior year second quarter, primarily due to favorable sales mix given stronger home standby shipments and the realization of lower input cost including lower freight and steel cost as well as improved production efficiencies. Second quarter gross margins exceeded our expectations as we were able to deliver the implied gross margin ramp in the second-half of the year sooner than expected given improving input cost. Operating expenses increased $30 million or 12% as compared to the second quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to ongoing investment in resources to drive future growth across the business including salaries, benefits, stock compensations and bonus, and higher marketing and promotional spend to create incremental awareness for our products. As a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $165 million or 16.5% of net sales in the second quarter as compared to $137 million or 13.6% of net sales in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margins came in ahead of our expectations during the quarter as a result of the gross margin outperformance as well as lower operating expenses compared to prior forecast. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales including intersegment sales increased 1% to $827 million in the quarter as compared to $815 million in the prior year quarter. A strong growth in the residential product category was mostly offset by expected weakness in C&I produce shipments. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $140 million, representing a 16.9% margin as compared to $103 million in the prior year or 12.7% of total sales. This margin improvement was primarily driven by favorable sales mix and the realization of lower input cost, partially offset by higher operating expense investments to support future growth initiatives. International segment total sales including intersegment sales decreased 18% to $185 million in the quarter as compared to $224 million in the prior year quarter. The approximate 18% total sales decline for the segment was primarily driven by a decrease in intercompany shipments from our Mexican operations to the domestic telecom market as well as lower shipments in most European markets, most notably for portable generators. This softness was partially offset by increased sales in other key regions such as Latin America and India. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interest was $25 million, or 13.6% of total sales, as compared to $33 million, or 14.9% of total sales in the prior year. This margin decline was primarily due to reduced operating leverage on lower shipments during the quarter. Now, switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2024 on a consolidated basis, as disclosed in our earnings release, gap net income for the company in the quarter was $59 million as compared to $45 million for the second quarter of 2023. GAAP income taxes during the current year's second quarter were $20 million or an effective tax rate of 25% as compared to $16 million or an effective tax rate of 25.9% for the prior year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by certain unfavorable discrete tax items in the prior year period, which did not repeat in the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.97 in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $0.70 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $82 million in the current year quarter, or $1.35 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $68 million in the prior year, or $1.08 per share. Cash flow from operations in the current year's second quarter was $78 million, as compared to $83 million in the prior year's second quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $50 million, as compared to $54 million in the same quarter last year. This change in free cash flow was primarily driven by higher cash income tax payments in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher operating earnings. Additionally, during the second quarter, we repurchased 355,640 shares of our common stock for approximately $51 million. There is an approximately $449 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization as of June 30th. In early July, we amended and replaced our existing $530 million term loan B credit facility, which was set to mature in December 2026 with a new credit facility that has an aggregate principal amount of $500 million after we made a $30 million cash prepayment in connection with the term loan amendment. This new credit facility has a maturity date of July 3, 2031. The new credit facility maintains the existing low rate of SOFR plus 175 basis points while also eliminating a 10 basis point credit spread adjustment that was included in the previous term loan B credit facility. Quarterly principal payments equal to $1.25 million will begin in October 2024 with a lump sum due at maturity in July 2031. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.56 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2.25 times on an as-reported basis, a continued reduction from 2.5 times at the end of 2023. As we expect to generate strong free cash flow in the second-half of 2024, we will continue to execute a disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. With that, I will now provide further comments on our updated outlook for 2024. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are increasing our overall outlook for full-year 2024. Given the elevated demand for backup power in the state of Texas due to the recent power outages, including Hurricane Beryl that made landfall in early July, we now expect overall 2024 net sales growth to be approximately 4% to 8% as compared to the prior year. This is an increase from the previously expected range of 3% to 7%. Again, as a result of the recent outage activity in Texas, we are increasing our expectations for 2024 home standby generator sales growth to be in the high teens range, and portable generator sales are also now expected to be well above our prior forecast. Partially offsetting these strong trends in Texas, we are seeing continued softness in residential clean energy and chore markets, resulting in only a modest reduction in our outlook for those products. As a result, overall residential product sales for the full-year are now expected to grow at a mid-teens rate as compared to our prior forecast for low double-digit growth. Our full-year 2024 sales growth outlook for the remaining product categories is unchanged from our prior forecast. From a pacing perspective, we anticipate year-over-year net sales growth will accelerate as we move through the second-half of the year, with third quarter net sales growth in the high single-digit range and fourth quarter net sales growth in the low to mid-teens range. This guidance assumes power outage activity that is aligned with the longer-term baseline average for the remainder of the year and does not assume the benefit of an additional major power outage event for the rest of the year. Our gross margin expectations for the full-year 2024 have also increased relative to our previous guidance, given the second quarter outperformance and higher sales mix from home standby generator sales in the second-half of the year. We now expect gross margins to improve by approximately 350 to 400 basis points over the full-year 2023. This is an increase from the 300 to 350 basis point improvement previously expected. Gross margins are projected to grow sequentially through the remainder of the year due to continued favorable mix, price, and cost, with fourth quarter gross margins improving over third quarter gross margins by approximately 50 basis points. As a result of this increased outlook for gross margins, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interest are now expected to be approximately 17% to 18% for the full-year 2024. Additionally, we also expect adjusted EBITDA margins to grow sequentially through the remainder of the year, driven by the above-mentioned gross margin improvement, and additional operating leverage on higher shipments as we move throughout the second-half of the year. This will result in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins improving over third quarter adjusted EBITDA margins by approximately 200 basis points resulting in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20%. As is our normal practice we will also provide additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full-year 2024. For the full-year our GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 25% to 26%. This is expected to result in a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% for each of the remaining two quarters of the year. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add back items should be reflective net of tax using the 25% expected effective tax rate. Gross interest expense is now expected to be approximately $92 million to $94 million as compared to the prior guidance of $90 million to $93 million. This guidance assumes no additional term loan or revolver principal prepayments during the year. Stock compensation expense is now expected to be between $52 million to $54 million for the year as compared to prior guidance of $55 million to $60 million. We are also increasing our free cash flow conversion guidance for the full-year to be well above 100% as we anticipate an incremental benefit from working capital reduction in the second-half of the year. This compares to our prior guidance of approximately 100%. Our full-year weighted average diluted share count is now expected to decrease to approximately 60.5 to 61 million shares as compared to prior guidance of 61 million shares. This updated guidance reflects the share repurchases that were completed in the second quarter of this year. Our guidance for capital expenditures as a percentage of sales remains consistent at approximately 3% of sales. Depreciation expense and GAAP intangible amortization expense also remain consistent with last quarter's guidance. And finally, this 2024 Outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens, Inc. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Tommy Moll: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Tommy.
Tommy Moll: Aaron, I wanted to start on home standby. It sounds like the outlook for the year went from mid-teens to high-teens. It's a two-part question. First part is, can you characterize how much of that growth is just lapping over the destock versus incremental underlying demand? And then, second part on the demand, can you characterize activations versus shipments in Q2, and maybe even through July after the storm? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So, maybe, Tommy, I'll take the second part of that question first. Yes, on the first part of the question, obviously, we have been talking about a $300 million impact from the field inventory situation last year. And so, obviously, part of the increased guide here I would say this. The guidance we had originally proposed considered the destocking, so the increase in guidance from the mid-teens to the higher number would be really the delta that's storm related.
York Ragen: That's all incremental.
Aaron Jagdfeld: So that's all incremental. I'd have to do the math to give you a more precise answer than that. But that's how I would answer it, is that the original guidance did contemplate that. The destocking occurred in Q1 and we don't -- that hasn't been a problem as we'd expect it, here in Q2, and it won't be a problem in the balance of the year. As far as the activation and shipment trends from Q2, as we said, activations in the first-half of the year were modestly down. That really is related to the lower power outage activity that we saw last year. And in the beginning we kind of started off the year a little bit slow. Here in 2024, Q1's outage hours were below the baseline average, but they've obviously picked here in Q2. And we anticipate those activation rates to grow through the balance of the year here. And in fact, as we noted in the prepared remarks this morning, July, we're already seeing -- from a trend standpoint we're seeing that pick up. So, shipments were, I would say, ahead of activations if you're look just at Q2, but that's seasonally to be expected. That's how -- yes, and it was only slightly, it wasn't a big number. But that's how the business paces in terms of preparing for the season. We want our channel partners to have that product ready to go. But again as we've said previously as we exited Q1, we feel like those field inventory levels are at normal, right? So, this is all part of the normal seasonal trend at this point.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. Go ahead. Your line is open.
George Gianarikas: Hi, good morning everyone, and thank you for taking my questions.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, George.
George Gianarikas: I'd like to focus on what you've seen or what you say in July that led to the guidance increase. Clearly there has been an impact from the hurricane, but can you just isolate the pockets of increased interest and in home consultation and activations? Was it strictly in the areas that were impacted by the hurricane or were there reverberations throughout Texas where you saw increased activity and interest outside of those regions? And to the extent you could share this data, to the extent you have it, what are the high penetration rates -- the highest penetration rates that you're seeing in parts of Texas, and how much further can we go in penetration in your opinion over the long-term? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, thanks, George. So, what we saw in July, obviously, was that the Hurricane Beryl impact was significant. And in a market, in Houston, that had been also impacted earlier in May by -- I think some people referred to it as a derecho, kind of a straight-line wind event that created outages. And I think really the impact of Beryl even though it was a Cat 1 storm and not really that strong meteorologically, the way they're scored, the ground was very saturated and there was high enough winds that that led to just a lot of infrastructure damage, physical damage with trees and other things taking out components of the grid. And so, it took a long time to repair. And what we've -- in our experience with outages, it's really frankly more the length of the outage. So, the duration is -- it plays a huge role in getting people to a point of high interest in finding solutions, right? And so our increased guidance is really reflective of two things. One, we sold a lot of portable generators in July. As you would expect as one of the leaders in the industry, we carry a fair amount of inventory in preparation for these types of events, and that inventory was deployed very quickly down in that market. Maybe not as much as we would normally see strictly because that storm, you would normally have time ahead of the storm to prepare, this storm kind of caught people off guard. It was supposed to hit the Mexico-Texas border, and then it took a severe right-hand turn and went north kind of at the wrong time, and impacted, obviously, the Houston market instead. So, not a ton of time to prepare and get more inventory positioned ahead of the storm, but in the aftermath we certainly were able to deploy that. But then obviously the increase in IHCs, in-home consultations, has been dramatic in the month of July I would say. We have continued to see in our history here since we've been tracking IHCs, and remember that really goes back to kind of around the post-Sandy era, so in that 2012 to 2013 timeframe, so about a decade that we've been doing this. We continue to see with every hour of outage activity a higher level of intensity of the number of IHCs or sales leads we get per hour. And that definitely fit the bill in this storm. And some of that again is related to the fact that that market was also impacted earlier in the year by the previous event, so the combination of those things. And we have about 800 dealers in Texas, so we think we're in pretty good shape to respond to the event. We don't have 800 in Houston. We have a lot in Houston, but not 800, but 800 across the Texas market. And there is a bit of an echo effect that happens when you see an event like that hit a market, like Texas, you generally see an uplift in other markets with IHCs. I would say with this event, and that generally comes because of media coverage of an event. I do think that for whatever reason the media coverage of Hurricane Beryl was maybe a little more muted than you might expect on a national stage. Certainly, if something would have happened on the East Coast or the West Coast that tends to get the media's attention a little bit greater. Something happens down in Texas, maybe not as much. But nonetheless, I think the increase that we've seen in IHCs we believe underpins the increase that we've given in terms of the guidance. And today, Texas is still under-penetrated in our view, so we're roughly 6% penetrated nationally on the average. In the state, we're less than 5% penetrated today. So, we think there's room, and obviously it's a huge housing market. And a lot of people went through those multiple outages here, and we do think that pen rate is going to increase in the years ahead.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Michael Halloran with Baird. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Halloran: Hey, morning everyone.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Mike.
York Ragen: Morning.
Michael Halloran: So, a question then on the clean energy side of things and the margin trajectory for the common in the prepared remarks, that ecobee's margins started to tranche better, maybe what's the driver behind that? And when you think more broadly about the current headwind associated with all the investments and then the timing of the new product launched and when you could really start getting revenue associated with that, has the timeline changed at all from your perspective as far as that profitability improvement curve might look like in those businesses?
York Ragen: Hey, Mike, York here. I'll jump in on the gross margin commentary. Ecobee has -- the team up at ecobee has spent -- there's been a tremendous amount of focus on gross margin improvement really just working on the cost of the bill material of the TSTAT itself, and significant effort in terms of supply chain cost reductions, and whatnot. So, I would say the execution of those initiatives are reading through now. And there's a pretty significant impact in terms of the improvement of the gross margin. They were good before, and now they're even better.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. And I think some of that too is the fact that when we acquired ecobee at the depths of the pandemic, so I think the cost curves there were inflated, maybe even artificially surcharges --
York Ragen: Electronic --
Aaron Jagdfeld: Especially on our electronic components, and that has obviously relaxed as well. So, that's part of it. Not to discredit or take away anything from the teams in terms of their efforts, which have been great, but some of that is market forces. And then I think, Mike, to answer the question on timing, I would say this on timing. That nothing has really changed in the timing of our new product introductions, right? So, we're still targeting the end of this year for our next-generation storage device, first-half of next year for our microinverter products, those are all still intact. I think what -- and we may have mentioned this on the call, what may have changed is just the sour mood around solar plus storage, that market, right? The market trends there have been muted, have been relatively negative this year and have kind of persisted through this year with higher rate environment and still kind of absorbing the impact of net metering 3.0 in California. But that, I would say, for us, again, it's not much of an impact this year, but I think some of that might get offset if the market remains a little bit weak. We talked about this Department of Energy grant that we were awarded. That grant was -- we generally thought that, that would impact us to the tune of about $100 million when we announced it last -- late last year, and that was going to be over -- it's a five-year term. That was upsized significantly here through our discussions and negotiations with the DOE and the other partners on the island, and now we think that impact is $200 million, and the bulk of those installs are going to happen in 2025 and 2026. So, that's an element that we didn't have necessarily in our -- a project win of that magnitude. We didn't have that in our original kind of pacing, so I think that helps to offset any market weakness that may persist into 2025. So, I guess, a long-winded way, as I generally do, of saying, we're really not changing the timing on this. I think it's -- the puts and takes there might be a little bit different than what we had originally contemplated, but I think the timing is intact.
Operator: One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond: Hey. Two more questions. I guess one, input cost tailwinds, do you think they'll continue into the second-half? And then just -- I guess we're in a unique period where we've had kind of these elevated IHCs and maybe more tire kickers around grid instability, and I'm wondering with this storm activity, if maybe and this nurturing initiative, if maybe the uptake from some of those warm leads can drive some incremental uptake versus normal?
York Ragen: Yes. Yes. On the input cost side, looking like first-half to second-half, Jeff, if there's, let's say, a couple percent improvement from first-half to second-half on gross margins, I'd say -- I'd say the vast majority of that is just going to be with the higher mix of home standby come reading through in the second-half, well over 50% of that gross margin increase will be just that mix improvement, but we are expecting some further price cost improvements for first-half, second-half to continue to read through, but it will be smaller -- it will be a smaller piece of the puzzle.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. And then, Jeff, I think, with the IHCs and kind of the "tire kickers," we have seen an increase in, the -- I'll call it the broadening of the top end of our funnel. We've talked about our efforts in outreach to engage new demographics and trying to broaden the consumer appeal for these products more broadly, and that has produced, I think, the effect it's had is it's -- we've got a lot more people shopping the category. There's obviously the -- I would also talk about, the broader mentions of potential power outages from some of the structural things that are going on with the grid. We talk about the electrification trends. We talk about the decarbonization trends. We talk about power quality, being impacted negatively in the future here, today and in the future, and also power prices are expected to continue to rise, and that the media -- I think mainstream media has picked up these narratives, and, I think that also is leading to people coming into the funnel and exploring their options around resiliency and trying to manage their own power and independence and efficiency. That said, when you get an event like Beryl and you get the increased outage activity that we have, it's obviously an opportunity for us to engage clearly on the resiliency story with those people who may have received an IHC and for whatever reason didn't -- we didn't get to closure on a project. I think it's important to note, close rates have improved throughout this year, and they're up nicely from the end of last year, but what typically happens -- historically what we see is when you get a large-scale event like Beryl, you'll see a weakening in the close rate kind of temporarily in the affected markets because you get such an influx of leads. You get a lot of people into the funnel at once. Now, that could be somewhat offset by some of these warm leads being -- if we're able to nurture those to closure as a result of the event. So, I think that'll all kind of work out, in the future here as we look at what the close rate does, but we do expect the close rate to kind of step back here temporarily, but we have a lot more leads. So, and that's, again, a combination of all those elements is what goes into our calculus around raising guidance today. So, and once those leads are in our system, we can nurture them later too even if they don't get to closure today. We have, I think, much better nurturing techniques and capabilities today than we've ever had, and so the opportunity to work those leads in the future either on the back of future outage events or, certain promotions or new financing opportunities, things like that, we've been pretty bullish about the opportunities that as our growing house file, if you will, of sales leads, the ability to mine that file to the benefit of driving more sales.
Operator: One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Brian Drab: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Brian.
Brian Drab: I'd just like to -- good morning. I'd just like to see if I could ask you to put a finer point on the revenue -- excuse me, revenue guidance update. So, if we're increasing revenue growth by 1%, that's about $40 million, obviously, in incremental revenue. You had storm activity that we've talked about in May and then the Hurricane Beryl, and that's driven some portables. You gave us -- you said we're going from mid-teens to high teens and home standby, and that's $50 million, like 5-0, plus or minus 5 maybe, in that move from mid-teens to high teens. I'm just wondering if you could put a finer point on this so I can understand why we're not being conservative, especially given the outage hours related to this Hurricane Beryl were very close to the outage hours associated with the ice storm of '21, which at the time categorizes the top five all-time weather outage events.
York Ragen: Yes. Brian, this is York. I think your numbers are close in terms of -- directly close in terms of how you're quantifying the impact that we've included, at least in this -- in the implied guidance. You've got that home standby growth that you just referred to. You get a little bit of a portable improvement. You get a little small offsets with clean energy on some of the comments we made on that outlook. Chore products, some slight declines there that are offsetting, so when you put it all together, we've always said that the impact of a major power outage event would be -- in that year would be roughly somewhere between $50 million to $100 million. Like, we've said that for a number of years. So, I would say what we've included in our guidance, partly because it's early, we've included our guidance maybe towards the lower end of that $50 million to $100 million in terms of our impact from Hurricane Beryl. It's early. Well, the portable -- I think Aaron's comments about how the hurricane sort of took a sharp turn sort of unexpectedly in our -- we weren't able to deploy portables maybe before the storm. So, maybe the portable uptake wasn't as significant maybe in this storm as it would have been in maybe some other hurricanes where you can plan ahead a little bit better. That might be some of the impact that -- on the portable side. But I think on the home standby side, it's early. We've got a lot of IHCs have come in as a result of these. We'll see how the close rates play out on that, and we'll be able to update throughout the next quarter here.
Operator: Standby for the next question. Next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.
York Ragen: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if we could just talk about the gross margin performance. Last quarter we spoke about better material costs. In the first quarter, it looks like that continued versus planned. In the second -- and I'm wondering, as we think about the implied guidance in the back-half of the year, is there an opportunity for the normalizing material logistics costs to drive a tailwind relative to guidance given the continued strong performance each quarter so far?
York Ragen: Yes, Jerry. No. I mean, gross margins were up almost 5% year-over-year. We've been seeing that for a number of quarters here as price costs, improvements have been reading through. And then now we're starting to see as home standby field inventory becomes normalized and we're seeing that year-over-year growth in our home standby shipments, we're definitely getting the mixed improvement there. So, in the second quarter, I would say of that roughly 5% improvement in gross margins, I'd say maybe 3% of that 5% was mixed related. The other 2% was price cost. Again, we've been seeing that for a number of quarters. And as I mentioned, I think when Jeff Hammond asked the question, as we jump from first-half to second halves, we do expect sequential improvement. In gross margins, again, some further -- mostly due to the just continued mixed improvements with a higher mix of home standby in the second-half of the year relative to the first-half. But we do expect some price cost improvements. And as a result, you would continue to see year-over-year price cost improvements as a result of all that. So, at least in the second-half of the year, so yes, no, well, again, gross margins are getting healthy as the mix of home standby normalizes and price cost normalizes and improves.
Operator: Standby for our next question. The next question comes from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Kashy Harrison: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. So, just a few for me, how much does Texas contribute annually to revenue demand in a normal year on the revenues side? And then, on the C&I side, I was just curious if you've had any updates from your telecom rental customers on how they're thinking about the duration of the downturn. And then, also, I was wondering if you could just speak to the sustainability of some of the strength you're seeing in the industrial distribution business in light of, some of the weaker macro that we saw in 2Q. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Got it. Thanks, Kashy. So, yes, I mean, Texas is obviously it's a big market. We don't break out each kind of state that way, but we have grown, if you recall back with the Texas freeze, that event in February of 2021. We said our, penetration rates were sub 3% then. Today, they're sub 5%. So, in Texas, at 200 basis points roughly of penetration growth in Texas in a pretty brief period of time, about a little like about three years' worth of time. So, it's been an important part of growth here. And obviously, these events, both the derecho in May and then the Hurricane Beryl event are going to continue to drive that market forward. But again, still sub 6% at 5%, I mean, there's a lot of houses that said another way, as we like to tell our teams here, 95% of the homes in Texas don't have the product. So, and they are all kind of potential targets for a generator. And it's a huge market. And so, we're really bullish on that. In terms of the kind of the question on telecom specifically, we kind of think this is the bottom here for telecom for us, especially relative to the comparisons last year, the current pacing, though, the current run rate feels like it's at the bottom. In fact, the back-half contemplates a little bit of increase, especially as we get into Q4. So, kind of Q2, Q3 here is kind of the bottom for the telecom cycle, as we see it starting to maybe show some green shoots there. We're hopeful about 2025. But the reality of it is, we don't have any solid forecasts or information from our telecom partners at this point, that would say that '25 is going to be better than '24. They haven't shared anything with us yet. But once they get to that, that stage of planning for next year, hopefully we'll be able to relay some of that information as we as we get into the 2025 guidance next year. But it's an important market. We have an outsized share there. So, that's why it's kind of impacted us negatively this year with the pullback. But that's -- we're bullish about that long term, as I said before, tower counts, hub counts, all those important elements of the infrastructure for wireless communications, and then the critical nature of those comms, and the need for reliable power infrastructure, especially, again, when we have outage, large outage events like Beryl, it really does highlight the need for hardening of those networks. So, that we expect to be important long term. And then your last question on the industrial distributors. Yes, we've done a lot. The current -- and our team here, the leadership there, Eric Wilde and his team have done an awesome job, really working through our distributors here in the U.S., and putting the other plans to make the right investments in whether it be sales, whether it's service, whether it's our ability to support, where we're selling direct, either through telecom or other, other opportunities, we have to make sure we have that kind of coast to coast support. But also, we've done some acquisitions there, we've acquired a couple of distributors where we were underperforming in certain markets, and we felt that we could do better. And that actually has paid off quite well. In the markets where we've done acquisitions, we've seen our share improved dramatically. Again, we were underneath our share nationally in those markets. So, just getting to the share position would be an increase, but we've actually gone beyond that. So, we've seen some, some really nice results there, alongside kind of our organic efforts with development of the distribution partners. So, those are all paying off, we're gaining share. And we really like where we're going with that channel. It's helped, kind of be a bellwether here as we weather the downturn in telecom and rental in 2024 here, that channel has performed quite well. And we expect it to continue to remain strong here through the next several years.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Stephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning.
Stephen Gengaro: Just a quick one for me, you talked earlier about sort of the impact of storms kind of reverberating kind of across other markets. And I'm just curious, A, have you seen that at all in IHCs? And maybe even B, is there historical precedent where you've actually seen a meaningful uptick in adjacent markets or not? Or am I sort of reading a little too much into this?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Stephen. It's a great question. I can tell you that historically, whenever you get a widespread outage, it makes people think, right? So, as an example, in Texas, you get a hurricane hitting Texas early in the season, first cat five ever on record in the Atlantic that early. And people in Florida are watching. And so, Florida IHCs, there is a reverberation there that's positive, that gets people to action quicker. We advertise on a national basis so that advertising resonates better when in the background you have outages taking place. So, we have historical reference points for that. And we certainly have seen some of that here as well. Again, the only cautionary point I would put on that is that for whatever reason, the Hurricane Beryl Texas event was maybe less covered nationally. It was really quite a significant event relative to just the raw hours and the duration of the outages. And yet, nationally, the media just, I don't think covered it quite as well maybe as they might have if that had happened perhaps somewhere on the East Coast or somewhere on the West Coast. And that happens. But nonetheless, that's a reality of some of the way those cycles work. But we are seeing definitely, especially the Gulf Coast states, when you get into hurricane season and somebody sees, when people see a storm of that magnitude, something that gets to that magnitude that quickly this early in the season, and in particular where we've got a very strong season still predicted. So, I think that's another important element here is that that hasn't gone away, right? Nothing's changed there. Yes, it's gone quiet here for a little bit, but normally it would be in July and August or July in particular is usually a quiet month for events. But we'll see how it turns out the rest of the year.
Operator: One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Jordan Levy with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jordan Levy: Appreciate you all squeezing me in here. I just wanted to get your thoughts quickly on the on standby. I don't think I heard you brought it up unless I missed it. I know it's kind of a quiet period for that, but just any thoughts on any traction in that segment?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Jordan. We're still bullish on that segment. It's just gone. It's gone. And as you said, it's been a little bit quieter here. The higher rate environment has made some of those projects a little more difficult to pencil out. What's interesting is it kind of falls along the lines of a lot of the other, I'll call it, kind of clean energy related efforts, in terms of the impact of high rates, and that's something that's created a situation where the projects haven't gone away. They just haven't gotten a closure. So, I think, what's happening there is those projects are kind of idling in the background waiting for a more constructive rate environment. And then, we would expect that that's a segment that's still going to grow where a liter of natural gas gensets, which are used in those types of applications. I think one extension of that, that is becoming a little clearer, we're finding that the whole beyond standby category, which we had, I think, largely defined as just using a generator for purposes other than just emergency backup, using it to also supplement a grid that's under heavy stress. I think what we're finding is that maybe we have to expand our definition of that to include some of these microgrid projects as well, because in effect, what's happening is many of the microgrid projects have natural gas generators as an important component, but they also contain other pieces. They contain storage. So, the SunGrid acquisition that we announced this quarter, and that we talked a little bit about in the prepared remarks, gets us closer to another critical component of microgrids, which is the behind-the-meter storage element of that. And then, we also called out that we're seeing EV charging be part of these -- some of these projects as well. So, commercial-grade EV charging, so our partnership with Wallbox, I think, helps us be a little bit more of an important supplier to a microgrid project. And we continue to build out our competencies there in not only the assets, but the ecosystem, if you will, as we call it, similar to the residential ecosystem. We think there's an ecosystem developing on the C&I side. And we think that kind of that beyond standby moniker kind of would likely going to grow to include some of the activity we're seeing around these microgrid projects. So, still bullish on it, but I think in a challenging rate environment just I think it's softer than it will be longer term.
Operator: One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Donovan Schafer with Northland Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Donovan Schafer: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to see if we can get any more color on in the prepared remarks you said, on the C&I. I think it -- I believe it was on the C&I side, but some of the weakness there was being offset by strength in India. And that's always been a market that's kind of interesting to talk about. So, what have you been seeing more recently on the ground? Anything impacted by election politics or anything like that? And just generally any more color on the Indian market would be great. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, thanks, Donovan. And no, India is a -- it's a growing market for us. We through our Pramac subsidiary in Europe, we acquired an Indian manufacturer a number of years ago and expanded that relationship through our ownership of that in its entirety, built a new factory there for that market. And that our positioning there is different than other Indian genset manufacturers in that, and again, it's a little bit like a page out of the domestic playbook here. We're really focused on natural gas, and most traditional solutions for backup power in the C&I markets globally are diesel solutions. And we do offer a diesel product line, but where we're getting the most traction is actually with our gas products. So, those are products that are actually designed here in the U.S., built in India with our engines and our fuel systems and ignition systems, and then they're deployed in the Indian market. We're bullish on that because the Indian market is converting the natural gas. We see a lot of pipeline projects on the drawing board as part of the burgeoning infrastructure build out in India. I think if you just step back, India is poised very well to be the, I think, the chief beneficiary of some of the geopolitical tensions that have been rising between the U.S. and China. India is in a very good position to see the growth in their economy come at, probably at the detriment to China as a lot of manufacturers shift production away from China and move to places like India and other markets. And India, for all that it is -- there's still a lot of opportunity there. It hasn't grown as fast as China historically. A lot of that is just based on the infrastructure within the country is still not mature, has a ways to go, but there has been progress. I think the political environment in India has been more receptive to business here as of late, the last several years, which is also a positive. And again, I think we're bullish on India longer term. It's not a small business for us and you can just -- we put it altogether. But, it's a growing business, got nice growth rates. And again, we separate ourselves there by focusing on gas where other manufacturers are still focused on diesel.
Operator: Standdy for our next question. Next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Keith, go ahead. Your line is open.
Keith Housum: Great, thanks. I appreciate the opportunity. Just focusing more back on taxes just real quick, in terms of historically when major storms have gone through, how long has that tailwind been towards sales there? Has it been just a quarter or two, or has it been lasting longer?
York Ragen: Yes. Thanks, Keith. It usually goes two to four quarters. Of course, the bigger the event, sometimes you will get an echo that's even bigger than that. In fact, I would say Taxes freeze of 2021, that echo has only recently been quieter. And some of that is -- was exacerbated by the pandemic and just the impact that that created for people being concerned about outages. But something even like a Hurricane Sandy back in 2012 definitely went beyond the two to four quarters, remains to be seen whether this event will rise to that. I think we are kind of sizing it on the smaller end of a major event at this point. But again that may change our views and that may change as time grows. But I would say that at a minimum, this will take us through this year and into the first-half of next year.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Anniversary of --
York Ragen: Especially when you hit the anniversary of the event, right, like that's when media picks up. Hey, remember a year ago at start of hurricane season, remember we had Hurricane Beryl in July kind of early in the season. So, those things get picked up. Again, the media drives a lot of that kind of echo effect.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And then, to clarify like these events the way it works is that while you'll get a surge in demand and then that after go last for a while for number of quarters. Then, it levels off at a new and higher base line and where it was previously. So, that's why these major events and the broad awareness created by them, you tend to increase distribution that props up that are actively in market now ongoing -- on an ongoing basis to continue to satisfy demand. And you hold up that new prop up that's new in our baseline going forward.
Keith Housum: Great, thanks. I will leave it there.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Next question comes from Chip Moore with ROTH. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Chip Moore: Hey, thanks for taking up the question. Wondering if you would expand a bit just on how you are thinking about back-half of the year swing factors for that 4% to 8% revenue range? Obviously, it sounds like Beryl activations will play a large role. But just other key puts and takes, what are you baking in on consumer, any softening there on the low-end? Thanks.
York Ragen: No, I mean we're not necessarily seeing that in terms of --
Aaron Jagdfeld: Not anything beyond what we already --
York Ragen: Exactly. In terms of change from our prior guidance, for the most part, the guidance increase the impact of Beryl particularly in Texas. But maybe some around the edges broader awareness around the nation and -- but, we are not necessarily seeing a softening of the consumer that's offsetting that.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Beyond where we are at.
York Ragen: Beyond -- [multiple speakers]
Aaron Jagdfeld: Guidance did contemplated -- yes, we talked about that in terms of --
York Ragen: For instance, close rates are hanging in there. Now maybe with the large increase in IHCs from Texas maybe those won't all close at the same rate. So, maybe you will see a temporary moderation in close rates. But for the most part, close rates are hanging in there around the nation.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn it back to Kris Rosemann for closing remarks.
Kris Rosemann: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2024 earnings results with you in late October. Thank you again, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Generac Holdings First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.  
 And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Kris Rosemann, Senior Manager, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Kris Rosemann: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer.  
 We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. 
 In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings.  
 I will now turn the call over to Aaron. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Thanks, Kris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were ahead of our prior expectations due to higher-than-expected C&I shipments, favorable input costs and strong operational execution. We are reiterating our overall 2024 outlook this morning for net sales, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow conversion, which York will discuss more in detail later in the call. 
 Year-over-year, overall net sales increased slightly to $889 million. Residential product sales increased 2% as compared to the prior year quarter as strong growth in home standby generator shipments was partially offset by a decline in certain other residential product sales. 
 Global C&I product sales decreased 2% from a strong prior year period as a robust increase in shipments to our industrial distributor customers, mostly offset weakness in the domestic rental and telecom markets. Significant year-over-year margin expansion and disciplined working capital management helped drive a substantial improvement in free cash flow generation from the prior year, while we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives.  
 Home standby shipments were in line with our prior expectations during the quarter, increasing at a mid-teens rate from the softer prior year period that included a meaningful headwind from excess field inventory levels. As expected, shipments and activations were aligned exiting the first quarter, signaling that field inventory levels are reaching more normalized levels. The removal of the excess field inventory headwind is expected to support strong year-over-year growth in home standby generator sales in the coming quarters.  
 Power outage activity in the U.S. during the first quarter was approximately in line with the longer-term baseline average as higher outages in January were offset by lower outage activity in the months of February and March. Activations, which are a proxy for installs, declined modestly from the prior year period, reflecting the softer outage environment over the last several quarters and resulting weaker home consultation performance, specifically in the fourth quarter of 2023.  
 Home consultations did increase sequentially during the first quarter but declined on a year-over-year basis from a very strong prior year period. For historical perspective, home consultations in the first quarter were modestly higher than the first quarter of 2022 but were more than 3.5x higher than the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we experienced moderate sequential improvement in close rates during the first quarter as we continue to execute initiatives that we believe will drive further increases beyond this year, including data-driven lead optimization practices, sales tool enhancements and improved lead nurturing practices. 
 We are also making ongoing investments in engaging with our end customers and bringing awareness of the category to new and broader demographic categories to expand the overall sales funnel for home standby generators. We ended the first quarter with our residential dealer count at approximately 8,800, a net increase of 100 dealers during the period. We have also been experiencing good traction with nondealer contractors as we have seen steady increases in the number of installers in our Aligned Contractor Program, an effort that helps us better strengthen these relationships and improve our installation bandwidth while allowing contractors to purchase products through their preferred channel.  
 We will continue to invest in growing our network of installers including both dealers and nondealer installers as well as in the tools and teams -- as well as the tools and teams to support and optimize these distribution partners, which we view as a key competitive advantage for our business. Our teams have also continued to make incremental operational improvements within our home standby production facilities. These improvements contributed to the margin expansion that we experienced in recent quarters, and this momentum bodes well for future growth and profitability.  
 We believe we are emerging from the recent field inventory challenges with a continued focus on quality and execution as well as an improved competitive position. We will continue to leverage our unparalleled scale and strength in manufacturing, sourcing, marketing, distribution and our strong financial profile to drive growth in the home standby market in the years ahead as we grow the number of consumers engaging in the category, expand our industry-leading omnichannel distribution network, invest in customized sales processes and tools to drive close rates higher and expand the broadest product portfolio in the market.  
 While home standby shipments were in line with our prior expectations during the first quarter, however, our overall residential product sales were lower than expected due to continued softness in global portable generator shipments as well as weaker domestic energy storage in EV markets and continued post pandemic-related challenges with the market for chore products. We expect these specific softer end market conditions to impact our overall residential product category, sales growth for the full year 2024, but our expectations for home standby generator shipments are unchanged relative to our prior guidance.  
 Now moving to our Residential Energy Technology Products and Solutions, our Ecobee team continued to drive year-over-year sales growth in the first quarter despite a challenging retail environment as performance with professional contractors remain strong. Ecobee's number of connected homes and services attached rate also experienced positive momentum during the quarter. Importantly, Ecobee's gross margin improved meaningfully on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and improvement in electronic component supply chains relative to the first quarter of 2023.  
 Within our residential clean energy product suite, we continue to make progress on key product development objectives. And additionally, fleet health of our installed base has materially improved after substantially completing our warranty upgrade program in 2023 and with a continued laser focus on improving the quality of these products and solutions.  
 We are also moving forward in our partnerships with the Department of Energy as we work to bring clean power generation and resiliency to Puerto Rico via our residential energy storage systems and through our participation in the grid resilience and innovation partnership program in Massachusetts, which demonstrates our ability to integrate multiple technologies to support our homes energy needs while also providing additional value for grid operators.  
 Finally, we remain excited about our collaboration with Wallbox as we will begin shipments of the company's best-in-class EV charging solutions during the second quarter. We continue to expect that the investments we're making to develop residential energy technology solutions will generate attractive returns in the years to come. Our teams are focused on deep integration of the products and platforms we have acquired while tightening our focus on building high-quality solutions where we believe we can create the most value for the consumer.  
 With improved focus and execution and by leveraging our core competencies around sales and marketing, lead generation, distribution, customer support and global sourcing, we believe we can create competitive advantages that will become evident over time as we continue to develop the smart energy home of the future.  
 Switching gears, I now want to provide some commentary on our C&I products. Global C&I product sales declined 2% from the prior year, which was ahead of our prior expectations, driven by a decrease in sales to domestic telecom and rental customers, partially offset by continued growth in our North American industrial distributor channel and certain industrial and international markets.  
 As a result of the strong first quarter outperformance, our expectations for full year 2024 C&I product sales are now higher. Shipments of C&I generators to our North American distributor channel again grew significantly in the first quarter. Quoting activity remained resilient in the quarter, and we continue to drive market share gains within our core product lineup. In addition, our operational execution helped to reduce lead times during the quarter.  
 As expected, shipments to national telecom and rental customers declined in the quarter from the strong prior year period. Consistent with our prior expectations, we believe these end markets will remain soft in the coming quarters. However, despite the cyclical weakness in the rental channel, we continue to believe this end market has substantial runway for future growth given the critical need for future infrastructure projects that leverage our products.  
 Additionally, leveraging our 40 years of experience serving the telecom market, we are confident in our ability to capture the future growth potential around the secular trend of increasing global tower and network hub counts and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications and services that require significantly greater power reliability.  
 Shipments of natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional standby projects declined moderately during the quarter, as the higher interest rate environment impacted project ROIs and time lines. Longer term, we view these applications as an important opportunity for Generac, our end customers and grid operators as reliability concerns, energy prices, and market volatility, all trend higher. Additionally, we will continue to build a pipeline of multi-asset projects that utilize both our natural gas generators and our recently introduced C&I energy storage systems.  
 While we are in the early innings of the growth opportunity, we intend to leverage our leading position in natural gas generators to drive market share gains in behind-the-meter energy storage in the coming years as our C&I customers seek to utilize energy storage for short duration outages, variable rate arbitrage, and grid service opportunities, while also leveraging our traditional generator offerings for a complete resiliency solution.  
 We believe we are uniquely positioned to bring these solutions to market and continue to invest in the teams, technology and processes necessary to deliver comprehensive solutions for the C&I market focused on energy resilience and efficiency.  
 Internationally, total sales were lower year-over-year primarily related to declines in intercompany shipments from our Mexican operations to the telecom market in the U.S. as well as lower shipments in certain European markets, most notably for portable generators as energy security concerns eased relative to the first quarter of 2023. Strong growth in shipments to Latin American end markets partially offset this softness. Internationally, International adjusted EBITDA margins held at 15%, consistent with the prior year period as disciplined price cost actions were offset by lower operating leverage on decreased shipment volumes.  
 In closing this morning, we are encouraged by the ongoing improvement in operational execution reflected in our first quarter results as strong year-over-year performance in home standby generators and increased shipments of C&I products to our industrial distributor customers offset end market softness in other areas of our business. The return to our historically robust gross margin and cash flow generation profile, allows for additional capital allocation optionality and further strengthens our confidence in executing our powering a Smarter World Enterprise Strategy.  
 Additionally, the recent acceleration in data center construction activity, driven in large part by the emergence of artificial intelligence, has further increased the growing pressure on electricity supply/demand imbalances and underscores the relevance of the mega trends that underpin our enterprise strategy. Data centers will not only directly increase industry-wide demand for backup power, but have also served to raise public awareness of the looming electrical grid supply constraints.  
 Accelerating demand for artificial intelligence and the deployment of energy-intensive data centers join the growing trends of electrification and the reindustrialization of North America, which is driving power consumption forecasts meaningfully higher than previously forecasted. At the same time, grid operators continue to add intermittent power generation sources and retire baseload thermal generation, while also facing extensive siting and permitting challenges as well as critical equipment shortages.  
 After multiple decades of very little electrical -- growth in electrical demand, the aging power grid in the U.S. is clearly not prepared for the future trajectory of power consumption needed to satisfy these converging trends. And this is even before considering the long-term trend of increasingly frequent severe weather events that are creating additional stress on the nation's electrical grid.  
 Generac's backup power portfolio, in particular, is well positioned to provide home and business owners with the continuity and resilience they demand in an increasingly electrified world. In addition, our next-generation energy technology solutions across both residential and C&I product categories will further expand on our resiliency value proposition by helping optimize for efficiency, consumption, comfort and cost.  
 We believe our broad offering of products and solutions are uniquely capable in helping home and business owners solve the challenges resulting from this accelerating energy transition.  
 I'll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on our first quarter results and our updated outlook for 2024. York? 
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at first quarter 2024 results in more detail. Net sales increased to $889 million during the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $888 million in the prior year first quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 1% positive impact on revenue growth during the quarter.  
 Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the first quarter by product class. Residential product sales increased 2% to $429 million as compared to $419 million in the prior year. Growth in residential product sales was primarily driven by a mid-teens increase in shipments of home standby generators. This was partially offset by a large decrease in portable generator shipments in the U.S. and Europe given a strong prior year comparison, ongoing softness in the domestic solar plus storage market and lower chore product sales.  
 Commercial & Industrial product sales for the first quarter of 2024 decreased 2% to $354 million as compared to $363 million in the prior year quarter. Foreign currency and acquisitions contributed approximately 2% growth in the quarter. The core sales decline was due to the expected weakness in sales to our domestic telecom and national equipment rental customers. This performance was largely offset by a robust increase in C&I product shipments through our domestic industrial distributor channel, and growth in certain international markets, including Latin America.  
 Net sales for other products and services increased slightly to $106 million, including approximately 1% contribution from favorable foreign currency. Gross profit margin was 35.6% compared to 30.7% in the prior year first quarter due to a favorable sales mix, given stronger home standby shipments, improved production efficiencies, lower input costs and higher pricing as compared to the prior year. First quarter gross margins exceeded our prior expectations as a result of better-than-expected input cost realization and strong operational execution.  
 Operating expenses increased $21 million or 9% as compared to the first quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to ongoing investment in our teams to drive future growth and higher marketing spend to create incremental awareness for our products. More specifically, research and development expenses grew at a rate approximately double that of our overall operating expenses, highlighting our ongoing evolution to an energy technology solutions company. Operating expenses for the quarter were in line with our prior expectations as we execute strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth.  
 As a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $127 million or 14.3% of net sales in the first quarter as compared to $100 million or 11.3% of net sales in the prior year.  
 I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased slightly to $720 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $99 million, representing a 13.8% margin as compared to $68 million in the prior year or 9.4% of total sales. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 14% to $187 million in the quarter as compared to $216 million in the prior year quarter.  
 Foreign currency and acquisitions contributed approximately 4% sales growth in the quarter. The approximate 18% core total sales decline for the segment was primarily driven by declines in intercompany shipments from our Mexican operations to the domestic telecom market as well as lower shipments in certain European markets, most notably for portable generators. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $28 million or 15% of total sales, as compared to $32 million or 15% of total sales in the prior year.  
 Now switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of '24 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $26 million as compared to $12 million for the first quarter of 2023. The current year period includes a $6 million noncash expense that reflects the change in the fair value of our warrants and equity securities in Wallbox, a minority investment we made in Q4 of 2023. 
 GAAP income taxes during the current year first quarter were $12 million or an effective tax rate of 31.2% as compared to $8 million or an effective tax rate of 35.7% for the prior year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher pretax book income that reduced the impact of certain discrete tax items in the current year. 
 Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.39 in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $0.05 in the prior year. The current year period included a $2.7 million redemption value adjustment that impacted our earnings per share, while the prior year period included a $9 million redemption value adjustment.  
 Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $53 million in the current year quarter or $0.88 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $39 million in the prior year or $0.63 per share. Cash flow from operations in the quarter and the current year first quarter was a positive $112 million as compared to negative $19 million in the prior year first quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was positive $85 million as compared to negative $42 million in the same quarter last year.  
 The significant improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to higher operating earnings, a reduction in primary working capital in the current year quarter, and a large onetime cash tax payment in the prior year period, which did not repeat.  
 Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.56 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2.35x on an as-reported basis, a continued reduction from the 2.5x at the end of 2023. 
 With that, I will now provide further comments on our updated outlook for 2024. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are maintaining our overall outlook for net sales and adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year 2024. For our top line sales outlook, we still expect overall year-over-year growth to be approximately 3% to 7%, which includes a slight favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. However, we now expect a slightly lower mix of residential products and a slightly higher mix of C&I products compared to our previous expectations. 
 As Aaron previously mentioned, we are not changing our outlook for home standby generator shipments for the full year. As field inventory for home standby generators normalizes and we start shipping in line with the end market, we continue to expect a significant year-over-year increase in home standby generator shipments. However, other residential products are facing softer end market conditions than previously anticipated. As a result of lower expectations for global portable generator shipments, continued softness in domestic energy storage and EV markets and weakness in short product sales, we now expect the full year growth rate for residential product sales to be in the low double-digit range as compared to the mid-teens growth rate previously projected. 
 Offsetting this incremental softness in residential end markets, we now anticipate C&I product sales to be higher than previously expected resulting in a mid- to high single-digit rate decrease versus prior year as compared to our prior guidance for an approximate 10% decline. This improved outlook is primarily driven by the higher-than-expected shipments to our domestic industrial distributor customers in the first quarter. Specifically for the second quarter, we expect overall net sales to be nearly flat as compared to the prior year period, with growth rates anticipated to accelerate in the second half of the year. 
 Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the remainder of the year that is in line with the longer-term baseline average. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event which could add $50 million to $100 million in additional shipments during the year. 
 Our gross margin expectations for the full year 2024 are now modestly higher than previous guidance given the Q1 outperformance. We now expect gross margins to improve by approximately 300 to 350 basis points over the full year 2023, an increase from the 300 basis point improvement previously expected. Gross margins are projected to increase sequentially throughout the year with second half 2024 gross margins now growing by approximately 200 basis points over the first half 2024 gross margins, given favorable mix, price and cost impacts. 
 Adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are still expected to be approximately 16.5% to 17.5% for the full year. This guidance assumes that the better-than-expected gross margins previously discussed will be mostly offset by modestly higher-than-expected operating expenses to help support enterprise-wide strategic initiatives. As a result, we now expect second half adjusted EBITDA margins to be approximately 450 basis points higher than first half EBITDA margins, driven by the combination of gross margin expansion and operating leverage on higher sales volumes in the second half of the year. This compares to the previous expectation of nearly 600 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement from the first half to the second half of the year. 
 As is our normal practice, we will also -- we are also providing updated guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2024. For the full year, our GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 25% to 26% as compared to the 25.2% full year GAAP tax rate for 2023. This is expected to result in a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% in each of the remaining 3 quarters of the year. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add-back items should be reflected net of tax using our expected effective tax rate. 
 Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $90 million to $93 million as compared to prior guidance of approximately $85 million to $90 million due to an increase in interest rate expectations for the remainder of the year. This guidance assumes no additional term loan or revolver principal prepayments during the year. Our capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. 
 Our overall cash flow generation guidance remains unchanged. Operating and free cash flow generation is still expected to follow historical seasonality of being disproportionately weighted towards the second half of the year in 2024. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted net income to free cash flow conversion to be strong at approximately 100% as we continue to monetize working capital build of prior years. Depreciation expense, GAAP intangible amortization expense, stock compensation expense and diluted share count expectations also remain consistent with last quarter's guidance. 
 Finally, this 2024 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. 
 This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tommy Moll from Stephens Inc. 
Thomas Moll: Aaron, starting off on home standby, wanted to see if you could reconcile for us. I think I heard you say shipments are up mid-teens year-over-year, activations are down year-over-year. Can you just help us understand the two of those in context? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. So it's a great question, Tommy. I mean activations have been a little slower this year relative to -- if you look at the outage environment most recently in the last couple of quarters, that outage environment has been weaker than kind of the trend over the last, I would say, a couple of years. So Q1 was actually in line with the long-term average since we've been tracking outages. But again, you look kind of trend-wise, it was a quiet relatively quiet quarters. You get past January, things really slowed down in February and March. And then Q4, as we discussed previously, was a really light quarter relative to kind of historical trends. So... 
York Ragen: And Q1 over the last year... 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes, Q1 last year was -- '23 was really strong for Q1. So kind of a tough comp that way. So activations were a little bit down. But yes, shipments are up because, again, the field inventory headwind is largely gone now, right? So we exited the quarter and really kind of February, March run rates, activations and shipments were in line with each other. So we think that's a really good sign that we're kind of at a point of stasis with field inventories in terms of them returning to normal, which has been the primary headwind here. So as that abates, that helps us in terms of comping more strongly on shipments, but yet the activation has been a little bit softer as a result, I think, of the most recent outage periods. 
York Ragen: The field inventory drag was a bigger drag last year than it was this year's... 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Exactly. 
York Ragen: Quarter, and that allowed for the year-over-year increase in shipments. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Exactly. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas from Canaccord Genuity. 
George Gianarikas: I was wondering, you talked about the tangential impacts of the surge and data center power demand. I was wondering if you could discuss maybe a little bit more in detail your strategy there? And any incremental you've seen direct demand directly from the needs of AI data centers? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, George. So our product range is typically underneath the range of products that are being used for -- purely for backup for the data center market. And that's a market that, they use very large blocks of power, and that's dominated on a direct basis by the large diesel engine manufacturers that are out there. There's a handful of them in the world, and they sell all the major data centers on a direct basis. 
 So we don't have a product like that, and we don't have any plans to develop an engine range. Those are engines that get used in tug boats and mine haul trucks and trains and things like that. So much different applications than what you'd see just outside of power generation. 
 That said, we do serve some of the edge data centers where the power needs for backup are not as great. And we also have seen some opportunities come across relative to natural gas backup. So today, the backup generator market for data centers is almost entirely diesel, again, driven by these large diesel engine players. But we are seeing issues around siting and permitting with certain large concentrations of diesel engines. 
 So in Virginia, as an example. There's some high-profile areas where permitting has been challenging to obtain for the kinds of -- the raw numbers of diesel engines that have to be cited and permitted to operate for backup. So some of these data center EPCs and owners have turned to natural gas as a potential option. 
 Now the blocks of power are smaller because natural gas doesn't have the density in terms of energy, as you see in diesel fuel. But nonetheless, the emissions are quite a bit cleaner, the emissions profile of those products. So that could be a potential opportunity. We continue to grow our natural gas generator line in terms of total output for those products. So we think there could be opportunities, but we think they're primarily going to be smaller edge data centers. 
 Probably the bigger opportunity, George, is indirectly, right? The amount of data centers that are going to be coming online here between now and 2030, so call it, 5, 6 years. It's estimated that the amount of power that will be drawn from those data centers will triple from the current levels that we're at today. It's almost the equivalent like, if you step back, if we get to 2030, and if that happens, it's the equivalent of adding 40 million households to the grid. So we just process that for a second. I mean, in terms of just the raw number of -- the raw increase in demand that's going to come from these data centers in a very short period of time. 
 And for those of you who have been around the utility industry or even the energy industry for any length of time, you know that it's really challenging for grid operators and utilities to react quickly because there's a process involved, right, for, again, citing and permitting of new plants, the approval process through different regulatory bodies. And then, of course, what are you going to -- what is the generating capacity you're going to add? Most likely today, it's going to be intermittent, right? It's going to be solar or wind at a utility scale. 
 You can do that cost effectively to get to the nameplate rating of a thermal plant. But unfortunately, those are intermittent sources. So you need to have a different strategy with how you're going to operate on a 24/7 basis. So you either need to add storage of some sort, which is quite a bit more expensive, obviously, and that would obviously have to be passed along to rate payers or you've got to come up with a different approach, virtual power plants, other grid services type programs to help offload demand during peak times or to augment supply during those peak times with distributed assets that might be out there and available on the grid. 
 We're definitely seeing much greater interest with grid operators and utilities in these types of conversations and programs. But again, many times, they're bespoke. They're highly customized and there's complicated processes to get to get these programs up and running. And so it's just going to take time. And data centers and the data center operators are not going to wait. The opportunity with AI is just -- it's far too great, and it's coming at us very, very quickly. 
 So we think that structurally, what that's going to result in just on a net basis is reduced quality of power. And I just don't think that, we even have a remote inkling of what's going to happen over the next 5 to 10 years in terms of power quality. It's clear to me that what we're going to see here in the future is a critical degradation of power and shortages. These are not weather-driven outages, although those will happen because the grid is -- continue to be susceptible to weather. 
 But it's really the supply-demand imbalance that's going to continue to grow. As on the supply side, we're dealing with replacing traditional 24/7 thermal assets like coal and gas, with intermittent assets like wind and solar. And then on the demand side, we're racing to electrify everything, and we're adding all of this additional load profile from data centers. So it's just not a great setup for power quality in the years ahead. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. 
Michael Halloran: So just digging a little deeper on the C&I side of things. It sounds like a pretty similar outlook for the rental and telecom channels. Maybe talk to 2 things here. One, how you're thinking about the seasonality for the businesses in the areas where the outlook has improved? And then also the confidence in the sustainability of the run rate. And so more of the distribution side, some of the other areas? And any kind of evidence you would point to for the sustainability piece and why you think that might have some nice legs here relative to what you were thinking a couple of months back? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Mike. So our C&I business has continued to perform quite well in the face of -- as you noted and as we've been noting for quite some time now, in the slowdown, the cyclical slowdown that we're experiencing in the rental markets as well as the telecom markets, which, again, guidance for rental and telecom are largely unchanged for the year. Really, the change has come from our industrial distribution channel, which is, again, they're serving businesses. They're serving the infrastructure like wastewater treatment plants and school districts and other types of applications, a very wide range of applications, health care, manufacturing plants, even data centers, as I mentioned before, data and telco, outside of the strict telecom market that we talk about oftentimes on a direct basis. 
 But that industrial distributor channel for us has been a growing channel for really the greater part of the last decade. We've invested heavily in it. We've done some acquisitions along the way where we've been able to attack some of the markets where we felt we were underrepresented from a market share standpoint around the U.S. We've infilled that with owned distribution, if you will. And that has -- that playbook has worked out quite well for us. And we've been able to pick up share is really kind of flat out, the answer. 
 So it's coming in stronger. It's been very resilient, right? We haven't necessarily seen the breakdown there. I think that's representative of the broader power quality discussions that we've been having here and have had for some time, right? Whether you're talking about the supply demand imbalance that I just prattle on about or just the continued challenges with reliable supply and also just the deeper electrification within businesses, right? I mean businesses today without power, you just -- you can't operate. 
 And we used to point to certain markets or certain applications that were "critical" for backup power. I would say almost every business today would say they critically rely on a continuous source of power. So without that, whether it's inventory spoilage or whether that's an interruption of revenues, significant disruption to their businesses exist when you get these outages, and outages over time have been on the rise. And I think you're just seeing that manifest itself in a broader penetration rate for backup power in these buildings that represent the C&I market in North America. 
 And we've been very pleased with the resiliency there. And so that's largely offsetting the weakness -- the cyclical weakness that we were forecasting here for rental and telecom. And we're saying, hey, look, we like the trends for that industrial distributor channel continue to be pretty solid... 
York Ragen: Quoting is hanging in there... 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Quoting is hanging in there. The quote-to-sale conversion process has continued to hang in there. And we continue to invest in it. And I think all of those things when you line them up are really what are helping us offset the broader weakness in those other markets. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Jeffrey Hammond: So just back on residential One, maybe just speak to destocking and whether you think it's done, if not how much left? And then it just seems like IHC activation trends were kind of still pretty weak. And so just want to come back to like, I know it was kind of in line in the quarter, but what gives you confidence, an unchanged view and kind of the ramp into the second half outside of just seasonality? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. So yes, from a destocking perspective, again, we exited the quarter, February and March, activations and shipments were pretty much in line. So we felt like -- and again, based on all the data we have and based on the extended period here of destocking that we've been experiencing really since the third quarter of 2022, we feel like we're finally through that. And so that's in line with our prior expectations. And that largely is behind, I think, the -- again, as we -- as I mentioned previously, the ability to kind of post those mid-teens increases year-over-year in home standby shipments. So we don't have that field inventory headwind now that that's primarily gone. 
 In terms of the weaker trends recently here, activations in IHCs, maybe a little bit underneath what we were anticipating, but not dramatically off the pace. So we feel pretty good about seasonally -- frankly, January was a solid month with outages, February, March, not so good. In fact, they were -- February and March were really quiet. April, on the other hand, came back strong. And so you kind of get into the seasonal time frame here for these types of products, and we're seeing the kinds of upticks that you would expect to see in these key metrics that we track, both leading and lagging indicators. So we feel pretty good about that guide and hanging on to that guide for the year. 
 I think that, again, we've said this that the category itself is less sensitive to some of the interest rate movements and things that you might see in other typical, what you might call, consumer discretionary types of categories. Power outages create, I think, a different -- they elicit a different response, right? I mean it's just -- it's an emotional category a lot of times. Also the demographic that's traditionally buying these products. These are -- they skew older. It's older Americans with their homeowners, the aging in place trends that we've talked about previously are very much intact. 
 And I think that these are homeowners that are just less sensitive to movements in interest rates. It doesn't mean around the edges that we won't see decreases, market demand decreases. And I think that's largely played out here in the back half of last year. I mean interest rates have been high now for a while. It's not -- this isn't a new phenomenon. So I think whatever impact that higher interest rates may have had on the margins, on the edges of the market, we think that's largely baked in at this point. 
 I do think that, again, just thinking forward, to the balance of the year, I'll just also point out that the Colorado State University, hurricane forecast was, I think it was -- what was it? The most active, York, forecast ever? 
York Ragen: Ever. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: So I mean we don't... 
York Ragen: Preseason forecast. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Personally, we don't tend to put a lot of stock in those forecasts because they -- I have a hard time believing that if you can't tell me what the weather is going to be next Saturday, how can you tell me what it's going to be in September. But again, I think we're looking at longer-term trends around air temperatures, water temperatures, the relaxing of the El Nino events. I think those are things that are important to how forecasters think about the long-term, the bigger cycles around things like hurricanes. So that's coming as well. 
York Ragen: But our guidance assumes baseline outage activity, doesn't assume any majors. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. 
York Ragen: And I think it's important also to mention like the category is seasonal. So second half is always stronger than the first half. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Definitely. 
York Ragen: You would -- if you're assuming baseline level of outage activity, you would expect a nice sequential increase from first half to second half in that home standby business to support our guidance. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. 
Brian Drab: I was wondering if we could just focus in on energy technology for a minute. And I'm looking at the slide from the investor event last year and about 40% of the incremental revenue between 2023 and 2026 and the bridge here is from incremental revenue from energy technology, and C&I, and residential. Can you just give us an update on how you feel about capturing that $700 million incremental revenue? And what's the updated outlook, C&I and resi? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Brian. So I mean, obviously, we gave those guidance points last fall. And we're not in a position today to update the next couple of years. But I -- we can talk specifically to Energy Tech and how we're thinking about that. Obviously, the market for solar plus storage, the market for EV charging, the market for some of the products that are within that complex. I would say are weaker today. The near-term market dynamics are clearly more negative coming off of, the pull ahead from NEM 3.0 in California and then just higher interest rates. I think the impact of that's having on those markets and the demand for those products. So that's the negative news. 
 The good news is we're still out in the market with our new products. We're on target for our launch plans later this year. And I think we're optimistic that as we turn the corner into 2025, look, interest rates are not going to remain high forever. And so I think -- and the NEM 3.0 pull ahead, pull in, I think it's pretty well documented that, that seems like the market is finally kind of emptying itself of some of the inventory challenges that the OEMs that are providers to that market today have experienced here over the last several quarters. I think that's starting to abate. 
 I think it's perfect timing by the time we get into the market, I think the market is going to be where we need it to be so that we can start to see success. So I wouldn't say we're in a position today to think differently, other than near term, right? And so near term, this year, we're probably going to be a little bit on the low end of our range. Again, it's not a big part of our business today. So a small move, and that's part of the residential, the other residential products being softer that we talked about in our prepared remarks. Some of that is the solar plus storage and EV charging just being probably a little bit more muted here in terms of market demand in the short term. 
 But again, if you're talking about over the next -- through 2026, for the next 2 or 3 years, we're just -- we don't think that that's probably going to change dramatically because I think the market is going to come back by the time we're in a position to participate in that. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. 
Jerry Revich: Aaron, can you just expand on your comments around gross margins in the quarter? We were pleasantly surprised. It sounds like the cost came in better than you expected as well. So what's the magnitude of improvement that you're seeing from supply chain normalization and going back to normal efficiency levels, freight normalization? And to what extent can that continue? Can you flesh out that part of the gross margin performance in the quarter and opportunity from it? 
York Ragen: Yes. Absolutely, yes. No, we were pleased with the gross margin performance that did beat expectation. It was well over 1% increase there versus expectation. And the reality is we guided that input costs would improve throughout the year in 2024. The reality is we just saw the realization of that improvement sooner than we expected here in Q1. So that's great. So the fact that, that came in ahead of sooner than expected. So we got to beat in Q1. And then I guess what that does is just derisks that assumption in the second half, that gross margin improvement that we expect in -- from first half to second half, we're seeing it now. So it derisks that assumption. So that's what's going on behind the gross margin beat. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro from Stifel. 
Stephen Gengaro: So my question, I guess, it's two parts. And one is, has there been any change to the competitive landscape given that I think your biggest competitor has kind of been taken private? And then maybe if you can kind of blend into that answer, just sort of the margin mix question. I imagined the strength in home standby relative to other residential products is a margin positive for the balance of this year? And any way to sort of quantify or think about that? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean, definitely, that is the case, right? I mean the margin profile of the standby products for residential is greater than every product we offer here in the company, frankly. So it's a very strong margin product for us. And so the margin mix to that point would be favorable. 
York Ragen: I mean gross margins were up 5% year-over-year in Q1. I'd say half of that was a better mix as home standby grew mid-teens. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. So that's played out. In terms of the competitive landscape, yes, there have been -- there's a couple of kind of developments in the competitive landscape. As you mentioned, one of our competitors here was -- is in the process, I think, of being taken private. They haven't -- are being taken through private equity, and we're a private company already but being acquired by private equity as a carve-out of the bigger enterprise there. We don't believe that's closed yet or haven't been told it's been a closed transaction yet. But, I mean it's interesting to see how it plays out. I mean, take private like that with kind of the -- there's a debt load. 
 We went through that. We went from privately owned to private equity owned back in 2006 time frame, and it's different to operate a company with a high degree of leverage and a large amount of debt. So I think that, if I were in somebody's shoes there, that's something that is an adjustment period and takes time to kind of work through. It's also a complicated carve-out of a 150-plus year-old company. So that may be a complexity as well. 
 I don't know that it will impact the competitive landscape that much. I think where that company -- where they compete quite well with us is on the C&I side of the business. And they've got quite a nice C&I business, good competitor there. On the residential side, they're quite a bit smaller. They may see opportunities there. But I think this is a place where we've done well, I think, to use our scale to our advantage. And that's, I think, largely why, as we've said in our prepared remarks this morning, we actually think we've improved our share position here over the last several quarters. 
 So we continue to spend heavily on driving leads for the category, driving awareness for the category, investing in our distribution, investing in our sales processes and all of those things continue to provide nice returns for us in the way of continued gains in share and again, a market opportunity that still remains really, I think, pretty huge. I think we've been doing this with home standby for a long time, but penetration rates are still only, what, 6.5%? 
Kris Rosemann: 6.25%. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: 6.25% [ Kris ]. So I think there are -- for us, when you think of every 1% of penetration being kind of a $2.5 billion to $3 billion market opportunity, there's a ton of runway left here, and it's worth the -- it's worth being, I think, being a net investor here, if you will, in the category. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Donovan Schafer from Northland Capital Markets. 
Donovan Schafer: I want to dig in and kind of unpack in industrial distributor channel a little bit because that was a positive development this quarter offsetting some of the other C&I kind of subsectors or channels or however you want to call it. So -- and Aaron, you provided some good information about like this is something you guys have kind of been building for better part of the last decade. But it doesn't get a lot of discussion in terms of like the mechanics and the kind of, I don't know, origin story or whatever. And so it'd be good -- I want to try and get a handle on kind of significance in some things. 
 Like the first thing would just be, can you give us a general sense of like what portion of C&I revenue that can make up? And then what portion of that would be distributors that you actually own? And some of this is also getting at the issue of like -- is this a case where stuff could get shipped to distributors but doesn't necessarily have an end user and so you can have like a channel buildup here? Or do the dynamics not work like that? So any time something ships through a distributor and you recognize revenue, there's a project or an end user that's going to be taking delivery. Just how that works in its size and significance? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean that's a significant portion of our total domestic C&I sales. So again, it's -- I think when you kind of step back, it's close to 70% of the total for domestic C&I. So it's 70%, 75% of the total, with the balance being, again, the mobile products and telecom products, and again, those are down largely here. So as we documented, they go in cycles. We're a big player in those markets in rental and in telecom. But when those large customers are not spending CapEx there. They -- that disproportionately impacts us because we supply a lot of equipment into those areas. 
 So to have the industrial distribution channel grow as it has been, is a really important, I would call counterweight, if you will, to some of those larger customers or larger concentrations of product and customers in rental and telecom. You're right, we don't talk a lot about the industrial distributor business, mainly because we spend an inordinate amount of time talking about residential, our consumer power businesses and the residential standby and Energy Tech. 
 And -- but underneath the covers here, this has been, I think, a really nice success story. We've got a great team there that executes well. You may recall, Donovan, we announced that we're building a new factory here in Wisconsin, in Beaver Dam because we believe in the growth of those products and the importance of that to our business overall and it's an area where we needed some capacity. 
 We've been building bigger and bigger products. We also did a pretty massive investment in our R&D space here in Waukesha, Wisconsin. This is our technical headquarters, specifically go after larger opportunities in the C&I space and natural gas, in particular, and some of the things we've been talking about with natural gas beyond standby kind of market opportunities. 
 Even though that's cooled off here recently in the higher interest rate environment, we do think that, that's really important. And I would say this, one of the things that maybe the unsung hero of our success when the markets around telecom in particular, when they cycle on, one of the reasons that we've done well there is because we can provide kind of coast-to-coast coverage with our distribution to provide the kind of service and support that those large accounts demand for their fleets. And that's kind of a really important aspect of our industrial distributor channel. 
 Again, the sales don't flow through there, but the service and support is a part of what they provide for us. So the 2 are kind of interrelated in terms of telecom and the -- we call it our IDC channel, our Industrial Distributor Channel. The products that go through IDC are very bespoke, highly customized. No 2 buildings in terms of their electrical requirements are the same. So we produce -- it's basically a configure-to-order business with a long sales cycle, with quoting and then it turns into an order, and then you've got lead time for these products that can be anywhere from as short as 8 to 10 weeks and as long in some cases, is out to 52 weeks depending on the size of the products and the type of products. 
 So there's a lot of influencers in the process from specifying engineers to even the architects that work on these projects and certainly, the owner operators, the electrical contractors, the general contractors, everybody plays a role in selecting the solution that is needed for a particular application. So over the last decade, on top of building out that industrial distributor channel, the actual distributors themselves and strengthening that channel we've been focused on engaging with all of those decision-makers up and down the value chain there. 
 And I think that's really helped us quite a bit in terms of getting Generac specifically named in a specification. That's really important. If you're not specifically named, that becomes challenging for somebody to find your product or even your distribution on a particular bid project. So those are the things that I think, engaging with those specifying engineers in that community and spreading the word about, in particular, the importance and the advantages of natural gas over diesel, which -- we're the largest natural gas genset provider for backup power in the world. And we hold an advantage there over others that we like to talk to distribution about. 
 So I think that is part of -- again, part of this story overall is natural gas backup power is growing more quickly than diesel backup power, outside of the large data center market. Have to qualify that now, and that's not a part of the market we play in. So in the served market where we play, we're seeing gas growth rates exceeding diesel growth rates. And that's been the same for some time and we're a beneficiary of that, and so is our distribution. So you're seeing all of that play out in that -- in the strength that we're talking about here on the industrial distributor channel. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Kashy Harrison from Piper Sandler. 
Kashy Harrison: So Aaron, I think you indicated that HSB activations were down modestly year-over-year. Can you just help us quantify that? What does modestly mean? And then you also indicated HSB shipments and activations were aligned in February and March. And so I was just wondering if, York, you could just help us think through 2Q residential revenues. I'm just trying to understand how we get from being up 2% in 1Q to being up low double digits for the full year. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes, Kash. So the -- from an activation standpoint, I mean, modestly, it's kind of at mid-single-digit range, which is, again, not too far off of our expectations in terms of year-over-year. We just -- we kind of expected it to be a little bit softer coming out of the -- we had IHCs in Q4 were lower as a result of the weaker power outage environment, frankly, Q3, we really didn't have much of a season last year in terms of the outage environment. So kind of the back half of last year maybe wasn't -- didn't play out as strongly as it might have historically. And as a result, it just -- you see that play out in fewer installs here year-over-year in the quarter. 
 But again, not dramatically so, which I think is good. And I think when you look historically, the category is still up, it's up dramatically from where it was kind of, you go to 2019 ranges, those levels of activations and we're up significantly from that area. So the category is quite a bit bigger today than it was then. But I think just a little bit off near term here from the weaker power outage environment in the last couple of quarters. 
York Ragen: Yes. And then your comment about like as residential paces from Q1 to Q2, we did -- in Q1, we still did undership the market. We are still bringing field inventory down and again, by the tail end of the quarter, as we get into Q2, we feel like we're back to normal for the most part. So we still did undership the market. If you recall, we undershipped 2023 by around $300 million. I guess, I would say, 1/4 of that probably a little less than 1/4 of that was what we undershipped the market in Q1 here. So we got back to normal. 
 So you won't have that in Q2, that undershipping. And then just the seasonality of the business picks up from Q1 to Q2 in that category. So that's again, that's -- you got to look back at what historical seasonality looks like in that, again, supports the guide for residential products in the future. 
Operator: One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Jon Windham from UBS. 
Jonathan Windham: I'll keep it quick as we're running a bit long. Just any sort of comments around you mentioned some weakness in the non HSB residential market. But one of the really strong markets right now is storage deployments. Residential storage deployments are up 200% year-on-year in California. Just some comments about the competitive landscape and your ability to compete in that market. I appreciate all the insights to that. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks. Yes. So storage attach rates are up dramatically. Solar plus storage install rates, as we understand them are -- certainly, new solar projects are down significantly. 50%, 60% year-over-year in California. And so you are seeing greater attachment rates because of the NEM 3.0 position. And that's where storage I think you're seeing just the absolute numbers are probably up because of that higher attach rate. California for us, that's a market largely dominated by Tesla. It's not a market that we've historically been strong in. So we're just -- we're really not participating dramatically in that. 
 I will say, I mean, our storage business is up year-over-year. So it's not double. It's not 200%. But that's an area that we are seeing some growth off of a pretty hard bottom as we've described over the last several years. But actually, as we also called out, I think the bigger challenge in the other residential products, actually, it's portable generators. We haven't talked a ton about that. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that both domestically because of the softer outage environment here over the last several quarters. 
 And then internationally, international portable gen sales were down hard Q1 year-over-year. There was a lot of power security concerns in the year ago quarter in Europe, largely related to the Russia-Ukraine war. And that's abated somewhat. And so we've seen the portable gen demand come off hard in the international markets for us, which is specifically kind of the European markets. 
 And then our chore business, which we don't talk about a ton, but that suffered from -- that's really suffered last year. The longer-term trends there coming out of the pandemic, there's a lot of kind of buy ahead on equipment, both at the end market level as well as the distribution level. And you can see all the public comps out there that are involved in this space on the residential chore product space. And it's been a pretty brutal market over the last -- really the last 1.5 years. And we were hoping that, if we got a little bit of a spring weather here, that was kind of built into the forecast, that, that would be helpful. 
 But what we found is distribution partners, they didn't sell through their snow season. It was a weak snow season, which with high snow inventories, they were reticent to invest in spring chore products. So that's been delayed a bit. Now thankfully, weather is picking up here, trends more near term or a little more positive with chore products, but it's still been -- it's been a rough go. So it's really chore and then those energy tech markets that have been softer and then the portable generator pullback that we talked about, which were kind of headwinds for us in the quarter. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jordan Levy from Truist. 
Jordan Levy: Appreciate all the comments on gross margins here. And I just wanted to see on the cost side, if you could give us some more specifics around what the input cost reductions were that you're realizing in the first quarter? And as a quick second part of that question, just curious on the sensitivity of costs overall to copper prices, specifically given what that commodity has done over the last month or 1.5 months? 
York Ragen: Yes. No, I think it's a number of things in terms of -- well, steel is probably our largest input and we've really -- those steel costs, I guess, over the longer term have come down. And as we've been turning through our higher cost inventory, we're just seeing those lower steel costs come through, again, maybe a little bit faster than we originally anticipated. So steel is an important factor. Obviously, logistics, freight costs, while those came down throughout last year and again, we're starting to turn through that inventory and the realization of those lower freight costs, we're starting to see, that's part of the improvement, just better plant efficiencies. I think that's better plant absorption. We're seeing that as well in terms of strong execution there. 
 So I would say those are probably the biggest factors on sort of how we were able to realize the better gross margin faster than we originally anticipated. In copper, I guess, copper, it does have an impact, but I would say it's lesser so than.. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: And there's lags. I mean... 
York Ragen: If you add to the steel side, yes. So copper has gone up. But that, I would say, is in terms of lower impact relative to steel. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Vikram Bagri from Citi. 
Vikram Bagri: I wanted to ask about R&D expense, which increased noticeably in the quarter. I was wondering if you can share where your R&D dollars are being spent; in your previous question -- answer to your previous question, you had mentioned that there are no plans of launching products that directly target the data center market. 
 So I imagine R&D is being largely focused on energy technology. If you can share the progress of next-gen MLPE storage products, is the target to compete in that market at a lower price point with lower failure rates or an ease of installation or there are new features or USPs, we should keep in mind that give you an edge against the competition in that market? 
 And then lastly, you had mentioned OpEx will be roughly 23% of sales last quarter, but wasn't mentioned today, I wanted to make sure the guidance has not changed, given the R&D spending update and on your comments on lead generation spending this quarter? 
York Ragen: Yes. This is -- on the last part on the OpEx guidance, I did -- in our prepared comments, we did mention that the outperformance in Q1 on the gross margin would get roughly offset by a little bit higher OpEx, again, as we continue to invest in those strategic initiatives. It's early. So we basically held the EBITDA margin guide where we had it from last quarter with the offset -- the gross margin outperformance slightly offset by the OpEx side. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. And then on the -- Vikram, on the R&D side, yes, we're spending very heavily largely a lot of those R&D dollars. I mean it's across the board on all of our products, but obviously, the energy tech products. We are knee-deep in our next-generation storage devices, in the residential side that we'll be bringing to market here later this year. And then, of course, our rooftop solar products, power generation products, inverter products that we continue to invest in. We have our next generation, those products coming to market in early '25. 
 So there's a tremendous amount of effort right now. We've been building teams. You may have seen our announcement. We opened a tech center in Reno, Nevada. We've been filling that with people. We've got tech offices in Portland, Maine. We've got tech offices in Vancouver. We've got tech offices in Bend, Oregon, in L.A., in Denver. And so we've really cast a pretty wide net here as we build out, the talent level needed to compete with obviously some very formidable companies there that supply not only storage but also on the inverter side. 
 So from a USP standpoint, again, we'll talk more about these product launches as we get closer, but we believe we've got some novel approaches to certain elements of the tech -- but we also think that there's the integration of all of these products together more seamlessly. Today, if you want to put together a solar system with a storage device, with an EV charger, with thermostatic controls, with even a generator for longer-term backup, load management, all of these different devices, that's 3, 4, 5 different apps you've got in your hand. 
 We're working on a project that is unifying all of these technologies on a single platform, really utilizing the Ecobee experience. It was the central part of our strategy in the Ecobee acquisition. The ML and AI that they deploy today in the thermostatic controls environment and the really high-quality user experience that they bring together. We want to bring that to all these products. And we think that will be unique to the marketplace. 
 When you look across the market today, we don't think anybody has the breadth of offering that we have and putting it all together on a single platform to help homeowners in particular, to help them control not only resiliency, which is central to our approach here, but also comfort and cost, which are as electrical rates, utility rates continue to drive upward. Cost is going to be, I think, one of the things that is going to creep up on rate payers in a way you're already seeing evidence of it in certain markets like California. 
 And it's going to drive homeowners to investigate other solutions, distributed solutions, solutions that help them give them more information and more control over the power that they generate, the self-generation that they store, that they export back to the grid and the resiliency that they absolutely demand in their own homes. So I think that over time, this will become more evident as these products get into the market. But I think and with our brand and our distribution and our sales and marketing competencies, I think you're going to see that we believe we'll have success there in the long term. 
Operator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Kris Rosemann for any further remarks. 
Kris Rosemann: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2024 earnings results with you in late July. Thank you again, and goodbye. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-14 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Generac Holdings Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Kris Rosemann, Senior Manager, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kris Rosemann: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable US GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Kris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Happy Valentine's Day. I think I can say that. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued improvement in operating performance as shipments of home standby generators returned to strong year-over-year growth in the quarter, despite a softer-than-expected power outage environment. We also experienced significant margin expansion in the quarter, driven by favorable mix and price cost tailwinds on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. In addition, we generated record free cash flow in the quarter on the continued reduction of our inventory levels. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 1% to $1.06 billion, and core sales were approximately flat during the quarter. Residential product sales increased 1% from the prior year as growth in home standby generator shipments offset lower portable generator sales in the quarter. C&I product sales were approximately in line with the strong prior year fourth quarter, as softness in the domestic telecom and rental channels was offset by continued strength in broader C&I end markets. Before discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail, I want to provide some highlights for the full year 2023. Global C&I product sales in 2023 reached an all-time record of approximately $1.5 billion, our third consecutive year of strong double-digit growth in the category, resulting in a nearly 30% sales, compounded annual sales growth rate over those three years. This included record full year performance in our International segment for both net sales and adjusted EBITDA. The strength in our C&I products has helped to offset the headwinds in our residential product categories related to elevated levels of home standby generator field inventory in 2023 and a strong comparable period that included the benefit of excess backlog reduction. Although our shipments to the market were impacted by these factors during the year, home consultations or sales leads increased for the full year despite not having the benefit of a major outage event during 2023. Additionally, our return to improving margin performance in the second half of the year, together with the continued reduction in our inventory levels, helped drive cash flow from operations to an all-time record for full year 2023. This robust cash flow generation provided additional flexibility with respect to our capital deployment as we completed $252 million of share repurchases, while also continuing to invest in advancing our products and solutions road maps during the year. We continue to make significant investments in our engineering and manufacturing capabilities in 2023, as we opened an engineering center of excellence in Reno, Nevada, and broke ground on a new manufacturing facility in Wisconsin to increase capacity for C&I stationary products. We also continue to launch compelling new products during the year, including the introduction of stationary C&I energy storage solutions for the domestic market to help decentralize, digitize and decarbonize the future electrical grid with advanced microgrid applications. In addition, the ecobee team launched a smart doorbell camera product line, helping to drive engagement to their platform. We also made important progress towards our vision of building a common platform and user interface for our suite of residential solutions through the integration of our home standby generators and propane tank monitoring devices using ecobee as the central hub to manage our products and solutions. Additionally, we introduced our new -- it's a power move advertising campaign to help drive incremental consumer awareness of the home standby generator category to a broader demographic range. We made further strategic investments in 2023 that help to accelerate our powering of Smarter World Enterprise Strategy, as we acquired REFU Storage Systems, a provider of stationary C&I energy storage solutions for European markets and made a minority investment in Wallbox, a leading provider of EV charging solutions for both residential and commercial applications. Our investment in Wallbox is expected to result in global commercial collaboration as well as the addition of a Generac seed on the Wallbox Board of Directors. We're excited to partner with an innovative technology leader in the EV charging industry and look forward to integrating Wallbox's solutions with our broader energy technology portfolio to further expand the value proposition of the energy ecosystem that we are building for homes and businesses. Importantly, throughout 2023, the megatrends that we believe will drive our longer-term growth were on full display as increasingly severe weather, coupled with the continued evolution of the energy grid in the U.S. further demonstrated the important role that our products and solutions can provide to the market. Although, the U.S. did not experience any major power outage events during 2023 and despite the fourth quarter being the lowest fourth quarter for outage hours since 2015, there were numerous smaller scale severe weather events that did occur throughout the year across a number of regions in North America, which drove monthly power outage activity above the long-term average baseline. In addition to the increasingly frequent and higher magnitude weather-related power disruptions, legislative and regulatory reactions to climate change are also impacting the power grid as well. On the supply side, utility scale, solar and wind power are being incentivized relative to traditional base-load thermal sources, but they are intermittent in nature and continue to face growing siting and permitting challenges. At the same time, demand is increasing as electrification trends are accelerating around heating, cooking and transportation and power-hungry data center and telecom infrastructure continues to rapidly build out. These changes are creating significant challenges as utilities and grid operators are struggling to reliably match supply and demand, particularly during periods of extreme heat during the summer and cold during the winter. In its 2023 long-term reliability assessment, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, continued to warn of the elevated risk of resource shortfalls across the majority of the U.S. and Canada. As key forecasts around supply availability and future electricity peak demand are creating a higher risk of imbalance, leading to potential outages more so than any time in recent history. As a result of these factors, we expect there will continue to be significant opportunities for our portfolio of power resiliency and energy efficiency solutions well into the future. Specifically for the home standby generator category, we believe a massive penetration opportunity still remains. As only 6.25% of the addressable market of single-family unattached homes greater than $150,000 in value in the U.S. had a home standby generator installed at the end of 2023. Furthermore, every 1% of incremental penetration is worth approximately $3 billion of market value. And with a market share greater than 70%, we believe Generac is incredibly well positioned to continue to lead the commercialization of this important product category. These same mega trends create significant opportunities for our global C&I products and solutions as businesses are also concerned about navigating power reliability issues and volatile energy prices. Near-term, we are focused on further executing on our strategic vision, which we believe puts Generac in a unique position to help home and business owners solve for the energy-related challenges that lie ahead. Now, discussing our results in more detail. Fourth quarter home standby shipments increased approximately 10% from the prior year despite continued field inventory de-stocking and a softer-than-expected power outage activity, which also weighed on home consultations during the quarter. However, in early 2024, severe winter storms pushed outage activity to record levels for the month of January. Power conservation notices sent to homeowners in select markets, driven by unseasonably cold temperatures and the related spike in power demand also contributed to consumer awareness of the vulnerability of the electrical grid. As a result of these factors, home consultations in January of this year were an all-time record for the month. Our residential dealer count ended the fourth quarter at approximately 8,700 in line with the prior year count. Dealer productivity trends further improved in the quarter, and we continued to execute on our initiatives to train non-dealer contractors, helping to increase overall installation capacity. Notably, close rates improved moderately during the fourth quarter, helping to offset the impact of lower power outage activity and softer home consultations. More importantly, activations, which are a proxy for installations, were at an all-time quarterly record in the fourth quarter, increasing slightly from the previous record of the fourth quarter of 2022, providing further support for our belief that the home standby category is holding a new and higher level baseline level of demand. The record activations in the fourth quarter helped to further reduce the number of home standby generators in our distribution channels as we continue to under ship end market demand in the quarter. As certain regions and channels of the home standby market have returned to normal ordering patterns, the gap between shipments and activations further narrowed as we exited 2023, and we continue to expect overall shipments and activations to align later in the first quarter of this year. For 2024, we expect home standby sales to increase at a rate approximately in line with the mid-teens residential sales growth guidance disclosed in our press release this morning. Additionally, we expect home standby generator sales to increase on a year-over-year basis in each quarter throughout the year, assuming that power outage activity is in line with the historical baseline average. In addition to home standby generator shipments returning to growth, Sales of our residential energy Technology Products and Solutions also increased during the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year, led by continued growth at Ecobee as our team there continued to gain share in the smart thermostat market by driving momentum with professional contractors and further expanding their presence with key retail partners. The fourth quarter launch of Ecobee smart doorbell camera was well received by consumers and industry experts and continued to showcase their expertise in delivering consistently positive customer experiences. Ecobee finished 2023 with more than 3.5 million connected homes, giving us a large installed base of satisfied customers that we can cross-sell our products and service capabilities to as we work towards rolling out our residential energy technology ecosystem. We experienced another important event during the fourth quarter as we were awarded grants from the Department of Energy to utilize our residential energy technology solutions for resiliency focused programs in Puerto Rico and Massachusetts over the next several years. The program in Puerto Rico is expected to utilize our energy storage systems to provide clean energy independence for residents. The program in Massachusetts is expected to include our energy storage systems, Ecobee Smart Thermostats and grid services capabilities, demonstrating our ability to integrate multiple technologies to support our home's energy needs while also providing additional value for grid operators by aggregating and managing these distributed energy resources in a virtual power plant setting. As previously mentioned, we made an important minority investment in Wallbox during the fourth quarter, which provides for a future seat on the Wallbox Board of Directors and creates the opportunity for global commercial collaboration across our residential and C&I distribution networks. The partnership also brings future access to industry-leading bidirectional charging development, which we believe will play an increasingly critical role in our emerging residential energy technology ecosystem as the penetration of electric vehicles increases in the future. For 2024, we expect gross sales for residential energy technology products and services, including energy storage, energy management devices and services, connectivity and home EV charging solutions to be in a range of $325 million to $350 million, a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 25%. We continue to make meaningful investments in building out our residential energy ecosystem, including our next-generation energy storage system, which is expected to be commercially available later in the second half of this year. I would now like to provide some commentary on our commercial and industrial products. Global C&I product sales were approximately flat on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and increased 19% for the full year 2023, to approximately $1.5 billion. Domestic C&I product sales declined modestly during the fourth quarter as softness in shipments to the telecom and rental channels offset continued strength in sales to our industrial distributors and other direct customers for beyond standby applications. Shipments of C&I generators through our North American distributor channel again grew at a robust rate in the fourth quarter. Although order patterns in the second half of the year were impacted by extended product time lines, quoting activity remained resilient despite being off the peak levels experienced earlier in 2023. Shipments of natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional standby projects increased at a very strong rate during the fourth quarter. As the leading provider of natural gas generators, we continue to pioneer new market opportunities for beyond standby generator applications and other energy technology solutions in C&I end markets. We are working to facilitate the development of our increasingly comprehensive products and solutions in multi-asset applications, such as pairing our smart grid ready natural gas generators with our emerging C&I storage, connectivity, advanced controls and grid services platforms. While we believe this is an important long-term growth opportunity, today's higher interest rates are putting pressure on project time lines. And as a result, we expect shipments of products for beyond standby related applications to be negatively impacted in 2024. Sales to our national and independent rental equipment customers in the fourth quarter declined from the prior year as order patterns remained weaker than the stronger prior year comparisons. Despite the normal cyclical softness in this vertical that is impacting our overall 2024 expectations, we continue to believe that this end market has substantial runway for growth given the critical need for future infrastructure related projects that leverage our products sold into the rental equipment channels. As expected, shipments to national telecom customers declined again during the quarter, particularly when compared to the very strong prior year fourth quarter level as these customers further reduced capital expenditures. Given our current visibility, we expect shipments to telecom national accounts will remain soft in the coming quarters, weighing on our overall 2024 outlook. However, we have experienced these CapEx spending cycles over the 40 years we have been serving this market, and we believe the near-term cyclicality will not change the longer-term secular trend of increasing global tower and network hub counts and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications and related services that are requiring significantly greater power reliability. Internationally, total sales were pressured by lower inter-segment sales, primarily related to declines in inter-company shipments from our Mexican operations to the domestic telecom market, as well as lower shipments of portable generators in Europe, as energy security concerns resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war continue to abate. Helping to offset this weakness, international net sales in other emerging markets such as India, the Middle East and East Asia grew at a strong rate during the quarter. International growth remains an important strategic focus for us moving forward with significant opportunities and continued geographic expansion and further penetration of underserved markets as we implement the generic playbook across a growing global footprint. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we expect global C&I product sales to decline by approximately 10% for full year 2024, as weakness in shipments to certain direct telecom, rental and beyond standby customers is expected to more than offset growth in other regions and channels. In closing this morning, we believe our fourth quarter results reflect a return to positive momentum in our overall business as our residential product sales began to grow again, which should help to offset cyclical softness in certain C&I customers and end markets. We believe we are nearing the end of the excess field inventory overhang for home standby generators and expect to realize strong year-over-year growth in shipments of these products in 2024. This momentum gives us confidence in continuing to focus on building out our longer-term vision for both residential and C&I energy technology ecosystems. Our record cash flow performance in the fourth quarter is continued evidence of the earnings power of our business and gives us flexibility to prioritize further organic investments, execute on strategic acquisitions and opportunistically return capital to shareholders. Most importantly of all, the mega trends that support our longer-term opportunities remain firmly intact and our conviction in our powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy is as strong as ever. I'll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter 2023 results in more detail. Net sales increased 1% to $1.06 billion during the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $1.05 billion in the prior year fourth quarter. The combination of favorable contributions from acquisitions and foreign currency had an approximate 1% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Net sales for the full year 2023 decreased 12% to approximately $4.02 billion. The combination of favorable contributions from acquisitions and foreign currency had an approximate 2% impact on revenue during the full year. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class. Residential product sales increased 1% to $580 million as compared to $575 million in the prior year. Growth in residential product sales was driven by a strong 10% increase in shipments of home standby generators and a more modest increase in energy technology products led by Ecobee. This was partially offset by lower portable generator shipments in the US and Europe, given a tough prior year comparison. Commercial and industrial product sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased slightly to $363 million as compared to $361 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from foreign currency and the refuse storage acquisition contributed approximately 3% growth during the quarter. This core sales decline is due to weakness in sales to our domestic telecom and national equipment rental customers, partially offset by an increase in C&I product shipments to industrial distributors and direct customers for beyond standby applications, in addition to strengthening international sales into emerging markets. Net sales for the other products and services increased approximately 6% to $120 million as compared to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Core sales growth of 5% was primarily due to growth in our domestic C&I service offerings from our owned industrial distributors, aftermarket service parts, connectivity subscription revenue and ecobee services. Gross profit margin was 36.5% compared to 32.7% in the prior year fourth quarter as a result of favorable sales mix, production efficiencies and lower raw material and logistics costs as supply chain challenges abated relative to the prior year. Operating expenses increased $2 million or 1% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by higher employee and marketing costs. The current year and prior year quarters also include approximately $11 million and $10 million, respectively, of onetime items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operations. See the reconciliation schedules in our earnings release for more information on these items. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $213 million or 20% of net sales in the fourth quarter as compared to $174 million or 16.6% of net sales in the prior year. For the full year 2023, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interest was $638 million or 15.9% of net sales as compared to $825 million or 18.1% in the prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 1% to $891 million in the quarter as compared to $881 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $192 million, representing 21.6% of total sales as compared to $144 million in the prior year or 16.4%. For the full year 2023, domestic segment total sales decreased 15% over the prior year to $3.32 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 15.8% compared to 18.2% in the prior year full year. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 13% to $190 million in the quarter as compared to $219 million in the prior year quarter, including an approximate 7% sales growth contribution from foreign currency and acquisitions, resulting in approximately 20% core total sales decline. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests was $20.4 million or 10.7% of total sales as compared to $29.5 million or 13.5% in the prior year quarter. For the full year of 2023, International segment total sales increased 6% over the prior year to $838 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests were 13.7% of total sales during 2023 as compared to 13.8% in the prior year full year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 on a consolidated basis, as disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $97 million as compared to $71 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The current year net income includes approximately $5 million of additional interest expense compared to the prior year due to higher borrowings and interest rates. GAAP income taxes for the current year fourth quarter were $30 million or an effective tax rate of 23.7% as compared to $13.6 million or an effective tax rate of 15.5% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily driven by discrete tax benefits in the prior year quarter that did not repeat in the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.57 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $0.83 in the prior year. The strong year-over-year increase in net earnings per share relative to growth in net income was primarily driven by an unfavorable $18.4 million redeemable non-controlling interest redemption value adjustment that was recorded in the prior year period, as well as a lower share count in the current year period. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $126 million in the current year quarter or $2.07 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $113 million in the prior year or $1.78 per share. Cash flow from operations was $317 million as compared to $101 million in the prior year fourth quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was an all-time quarterly record of $266 million as compared to $80 million in the same quarter last year. The significant improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to a $144 million reduction in inventory during the quarter and higher operating earnings. This was partially offset by higher capital expenditures during the current year quarter. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.58 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter of 2.5 times on an as-reported basis. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately $151 million. As disclosed in our press release this morning, the company's Board of Directors has approved a new stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock over a 24-month period, replacing the remaining balance on the previous program. For the full year, cash flow from operations was an all-time record of $522 million as compared to $59 million in the prior year. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $396 million as compared to minus $24 million in 2022. We strategically deployed approximately $153 million of capital in 2023, with the acquisition of refuse storage systems, the purchase of the remaining 20% minority ownership interest in Pramac and the minority investment in Wallbox. In addition, capital expenditures totaled $129 million to support additional capacity for future organic growth. We also opportunistically repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $252 million during the second half of the year. Moving forward, we will continue to operate within our disciplined and balanced capital allocation framework as we accelerate our powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy and execute other shareholder value-enhancing opportunities. With that, I will now provide further comments on our new outlook for 2024. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we're initiating 2024 net sales guidance that anticipates a return to growth for the full year period. This increase is expected to be led by higher home standby generator sales as shipments are projected to be more closely aligned with activations during 2024. We also expect our residential energy technology sales to grow as we expand distribution and launch our next-generation energy storage system later in 2024, and we continue to drive strong growth with our Ecobee products and solutions. Overall, we expect residential product sales to grow in the mid-teens range for 2024. However, in our C&I product category, cyclical pressures for certain telecom, rental and beyond standby customers, are expected to be more than offset or expected to more than offset continued growth in broader C&I end markets around the world. As a result, we are projecting global C&I sales to decline by approximately 10% in 2024 compared to the prior year. As a result of these factors, we expect consolidated net sales for the full year to increase between 3% to 7% as compared to the prior year, which includes a slight favorable benefit from foreign currency. Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the year in line with the longer term baseline average. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year, such as a Category 3 or higher landed hurricane or major winter storm, which we believe could add $50 million to $100 million of sales. As a result of this top line outlook, we expect sales to be in line with normal historical seasonality, resulting in overall net sales in the first half being approximately 45% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 55% weighted. Specifically for the first quarter, we expect overall net sales to be nearly flat from the prior year first quarter, with solid growth in residential product sales offset by a decline in C&I product shipments. With Q1 2024 being the seasonal low point of the year, we expect sales for each product class to increase sequentially throughout the year. Looking at our gross margin expectations for the full year 2024, we expect the realization of lower input costs and favorable mix impact from higher home standby sales volumes to drive continued year-over-year improvement throughout the year. As a result, we expect gross margins to increase by approximately 300 basis points for the full year as compared to 2023. From a seasonality perspective, we expect gross margins to increase by approximately 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter to approximately 34% to 34.5% due to favorable sales mix impact from higher home standby shipments and realization of lower input costs. These factors are also expected to result in sequential gross margin improvement into the second half of the year with second half gross margins projected in the 38% range. With respect to operating expenses, we continue to invest heavily in the resources needed to position our business for longer term growth in new and existing markets, maintaining a heavy focus on supporting innovation, and executing our strategic initiatives across the enterprise. As a result of these investments, we expect operating expenses as a percentage of sales to be approximately 23% for the full year 2024. We expect to leverage these costs as we sequentially grow from first half to second half, helping to improve our EBITDA margins throughout the year. As a result of our gross margin and operating expense expectations, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are expected to be approximately 16.5% to 17.5% for the full year, compared to 15.9% in 2023. From a seasonality perspective, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to improve significantly as we move throughout the year. Specifically, regarding the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be the lowest for the year in the mid-12% range, and then improved sequentially throughout the year, returning to approximately 20% in the fourth quarter. As a result, second half adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be nearly 600 basis points higher than the first half margins. Additionally, as Aaron discussed, we continue to make significant investments in our residential energy technology products and solutions to capitalize on the opportunities presented by these robust long-term growth markets. As a result, we currently expect residential energy technology to dilute our EBITDA margins by approximately 350 basis points to 400 basis points for the full year 2024, similar to the level of dilution experienced in 2023. As is our normal practice, we're also providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2024. Importantly, we arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add back items should be reflected net of tax using our expected effective tax rate. For 2024, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 25% to 26%, as compared to 25.2% full year GAAP tax rate for 2023. We expect interest expense to be approximately $85 million to $90 million, assuming no additional term loan or revolver principal prepayments during the year, and assuming sulfur rates declined throughout 2024 in line with market expectations. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. At the high end of our historical range, as we add incremental C&I manufacturing capacity and execute other projects to support future growth expectations. Depreciation expense is forecast to be approximately $70 million to $73 million in 2024, given our assumed CapEx guidance. GAAP intangible amortization expenses in 2024 is expected to be approximately $95 million to $100 million during the year. Stock compensation expense is expected to be between $55 million to $60 million for the year. Operating and free cash flow generation is expected to be disproportionately weighted toward the second half of the year in 2024, similar to 2023. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion from adjusted net income to be strong at approximately 100% as we continue to monetize working capital builds of prior years. Our full year weighted average diluted share count is expected to decrease to approximately 61 million shares, as compared to 62.1 million shares in 2023, which reflects the share repurchases that were completed in the latter half of 2023. Finally, this 2024 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.
George Gianarikas: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, George.
George Gianarikas: Would you just maybe focus on the HSB and the residential growth assumed for 2024 and mid-teens. Can you just help us understand what the underlying activation growth is that buttresses that guidance for the year? Thank you. 
York Ragen: Yes. George, I mean, we're not expecting a decline. I mean, obviously, in the current environment with a softer consumer tied to big-ticket discretionary. We didn't want to take an aggressive assumption on the activation rate assumptions. Obviously, what we said in the prepared remarks, home standby, we expect to grow somewhere in that mid-teens range year-over-year, similar to the overall residential category that we guided that way. Again, a lot of that is the fact that the destock of field inventory in 2023, while some of that is going to continue here in Q1, that will abate here in Q2 and for the rest of the year. So, a good chunk of that year-over-year growth is the fact that we don't have that that overhang on the field inventory but we aren't assuming that the home standby market is declining, some modest growth.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's kind of holding that new and higher baseline assumption that we talked about. In the absence of kind of power outage activity being above the baseline, we guide with it in line. So, I think in the prepared remarks, we even said we don't include any assumptions for major outages, and that could include -- that could drive additional opportunities, both with home standby and portable generators actually. But the assumption, I think York is right, with in kind of big ticket discretionary items in environment where rates remain somewhat elevated here, we think that consumer demand could remain kind of flattish and kind of at that baseline level.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Halloran with Baird. Your line is open.
Michael Halloran: Hey good morning everyone.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hi Mike.
Michael Halloran: Could you talk about the energy tech side of things, obviously, the 25% growth? Maybe a little better understanding what you could be versus the other products. But more importantly, maybe talk about the expectations for how you're expecting the new product launches? And I don't know if rebranding is the right word, but certainly, the newer pieces that you're going to be bringing to market. How do you expect that to start impacting the revenue line? Obviously, you heard York's comment on the margin impact year-over-year, the dilution there, but more just kind of a revenue thought process and how you're thinking about the cadencing of that being launched into the market.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks Mike. I mean a lot of the new products that we talked about. I mean we're in development right now and have been for the better part of 2023, actually, because we're going to make sure we get it right, and these are the products that are going to be at the top of the market, if not market leading, both for the energy storage products, which our next-generation energy storage devices, which should hit the market here later this year kind of as we exit Q3 and get into Q4. So, we really only have a very modest amount of topline allocated to that launch. We think it will get more traction. We have a lot of work to do, obviously, you call it rebranding, building out the distribution, regaining the confidence of the market with those installers in particular. We've been doing a lot of work there, and I think we're making headway, but we need to get the new products in the market. And so, there's not a ton of growth on that side. Ecobee, we do see continued growth there. They continue to take share. That has been just a fantastic asset for us, not only in just its growth curve, but also just the technology and the competencies that they bring to us relative to what we're trying to achieve with the user experience, right? So, we want everything we're calling it kind of single pane of glass is kind of our reference to it. But putting everything on the same platform, we've got -- we've acquired and/or have a lot of technologies organically that we've got products and solutions around, but bringing it all together to work seamlessly and synchronously, that is a lot of work. And so behind the scenes, as we introduce each new product, so this next-generation storage device, when we get to the micro inverter products, which will hit the market early next year in 2025, those products will all be -- they will all operate within the single pane of glass platform. You've seen some evidence how we've started to weave pieces together already this year. We've got home standby generators now visible. If a homeowner has an Ecobee thermostat, you can see the status of your home standby generator. If that generator happens to be running on propane, you can see the status of your propane fuel level, if you have a tank utility monitoring device. So all of these pieces are starting to get woven together and integrated. We're going to do the same with the Wallbox products as those roll into the market. So again, building all that out, I think Ecobee has been just a tremendous -- they have a great team, very adept at what they do. And on top of the top-notch products that they're in market with, with the smart thermostats and their doorbell camera, they're able to help kind of integrate this ecosystem and really bring it to life.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
David Tarantino: This is David Tarantino on for Jeff.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Dave.
David Tarantino: Could you maybe give us a little bit more color on where you see the home standby channel inventories versus the normal levels? It sounds like there's some lingering destocking into the first quarter. So maybe how much do we have left? And maybe on that, could you give us an update on the $300 million tailwind from the absence of destocking? Do we get all of that this upcoming year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Dave. So as we said, kind of in line with our expectations, we were getting very close to kind of wiping out that field inventory. We'll call it an abnormal excess field inventory. Look, this has been a painful process over the last six quarters. We overproduced ahead of the market demand, got ahead of ourselves, and we just -- we've been working that down. We were very close to -- we saw kind of normal order pattern starting to return in Q3 even and into Q4 for sure. And then we believe that most of that is going to be gone as we exit Q1. You're always going to have pockets markets, channels, customers that have field inventory levels that are probably higher than normal. That has always existed. If you don't get an event in a market or you've got maybe a channel that's underperforming to other channels. I mean, you can have that happen, and that's just normal cadence. So I would say that the big excess field inventory level, that thing we've been talking about here for 6 quarters non-stop. We believe, is going to be largely gone by the end of Q1.
York Ragen: We definitely saw it come down in Q4, and we're watching to come down here to date in Q1, and we're seeing it be in a good spot by the end of the quarter. And then I think your second part was about the $300 million, effectively undershipping the market in 2023. That was the estimate we gave at our Investor Day. That number is actually holding as we finish the year. So that's what we undershipped the market in 2023 for home standby. Now obviously, we won't get all that back in 2024 as a tailwind, given that Q1, we're still working things down here. But you'll get a chunk of that as a tailwind to growth. And again, we talked about that, I think, on the first question.
Operator: Our next question – next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian Drab: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could…
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Drab: Good morning. Can you give any more color or quantification around what's happening with the IHCs year-over-year sequentially?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, sure, Brian. So a couple of things. We saw IHCs actually soften in Q4, and that really largely aligns with the power outage environment was well-below the baseline average. So in fact, it was the lowest Q4. I think in our prepared remarks, we said since 2015. So pretty low environment for outages. And that fit with a good chunk of the second half, right? We didn't see a lot of activity, certainly no major activity in throughout the year last year. But in spite of that, IHCs were up on the year, total count so in spite of the softness in the fourth quarter. And probably more importantly, January, we got off to a pretty hot start. There was quite a bit of weather localized, quite a bit of outage activity. And then more importantly, I think one thing that we are starting to see, which is really interesting in the category, normally, the category has traded on outage activity. But what we're also seeing is evidence now in markets where outages haven't taken place but where media reports and other information is flowing into the market around potential outages, right? So these notifications of power shortfalls that some utilities had to send out in January, because of the extreme cold weather that actually drove IHC activity. Without actually having -- it didn't really result in a trendous amount of outage activity, but it drove IHC activity. So it's kind of -- I don't want to say there's a disconnect now, but looking purely at outage activity is probably not the only way to look at IHC, which are -- that's our proxy for sales leads. I would just -- one other kernel to this. We also continue to see a modest improvement in close rates in the fourth quarter for IHC. So we've talked about this recovery story on close rates. We kind of had assumed that close rates were going to flatten out after Q2 last year. And we saw that initially, but then we've actually started to see some of those close rates improve. And that's encouraging because I think it speaks to the continued not only interest in the product, but obviously, the conversion of prospects into buyers. So I think those are encouraging signs. There are green shoots, if you will, and lead us to have, I think, gives us anyway confidence in certainly gives us confidence in the guide that we gave this morning around the consumer power products.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks guys. Grant me a clarification before my question. Did you say 45%, 55% first half, second half split for sales?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, that's correct.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. Great. For curious what you have baked in for close rates following up on that topic. And last quarter, you mentioned October saw a nice bump. Did October account for all of the 4Q improvement? Or was each month at October better than the quarters that preceded it? I mean, each month in the fourth quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. I don't have the pacing each month for the quarter, to be honest. I just all add -- you're correct, we did say on the Q3 call that October, we saw some improvement. It was -- it's pretty -- it was modest, but we like that it was improving, not going the other way. For the quarter, it was up again modestly. So I think you can assume that it was -- it didn't drop off because that would have set us negative for the quarter. So again, I don't have the pacing, apologize for each month of the quarter. But the assumption to your question, the assumption for 2024, we are assuming close rates kind of continue on that modest improvement pace. We've got a long way to go to get back to the kind of pre-pandemic or that kind of pandemic-induced high, if you will. We kind of hit that. I think the peak, Chris, was, we say, Q3 of 2020 is where we kind of peaked out. And then we saw things really fall off as our lead times extended and now we've been in that recovery mode. The good news is, we're seeing that recovery. I do think kind of pursuant to my answer to the previous question, about -- or the additional color from the previous question about we've got more people coming into the sales funnel that maybe aren't experiencing outages, but they're concerned about outages and they're hearing more about it. Either because of media reports or other things or maybe notifications from their local utility that they could be at risk of an outage with cold temperatures if there -- if they don't immediately turn off or reduce their power consumption. Those are scary things. When you're a homeowner and you get that text message, and it's zero degrees outside, you need to reduce your energy consumption immediately or you could be facing blackouts. I mean that's -- those things send people on a hunt for solutions. And that's when we see and we are seeing evidence that people are coming into the sales funnel. I will say that, it's going to be a longer conversion cycle for those homeowners if they haven't experienced an outage. So we're aware of that. And we think that, that could lead to some -- could take a little bit longer than for close rates to really truly recover to that level as a result of just more people coming into the sales funnel and investigating the category. We don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. We just think that it means that it's even more important that our nurturing efforts and our efforts to continue to engage homeowners who have interest in the product category that we remain very diligent in our efforts there. So again, close rates, the assumption, kind of a modest improvement over the course of 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Arne, can you just talk about the margin outlook. So you had 20% margins in the fourth quarter. And seasonally, that's a 19% annual equivalent rate and we're looking at guidance of 17%. So what's the 200 basis point margin degradation beyond normal seasonality that you folks are guiding to R&D or other areas? Can you just expand on the drivers compared to the -- ?
York Ragen: Yeah, in the prepared -- I did talk about our operating expense investments. So we are expecting those as a percentage of sales to go up as we as we add the resources necessary to continue to drive our growth. At our Investor Day, last September, we talked about a lot of significant long-term growth opportunities. We want to add those resources here in 2024 to go after those opportunities. So that -- you had that before the revenue is incurred, and that's really across all of our business, not just -- it's -- it's our consumer power business, our industrial business, our Energy Technologies products. And you need to add those costs before the revenue and that will increase our OpEx as a percentage of sales, we believe in 2024 relative to 2023. And maybe that's probably the -- just to square that up with maybe the math that you're looking at.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I think, Jerry, just -- just one last comment on that. We have been investing heavily for the future here. We think those investments are both necessary and I think improve our odds of being successful as the market continues to change. There is just a ream of evidence around the fact that the grid is changing. I talked about it in my prepared remarks. We talked to a lot of utility and grid operators. They are -- there is a significant challenge ahead, as we continue to retire traditional thermal assets on the supply side in favor of renewables, which is -- I think we all agree, we want to decarbonize the grid as much as we can. The challenge, of course, is those renewables are intermittent in nature. And storage costs are still high. And large-format utility storage is difficult to balance out with the cost of building those renewable plants. You couple that with this -- what we're now seeing, which is an increase on the demand side, which we haven't seen in decades. The demand side has been relatively muted. Retail electric sales have been relatively muted over the last couple of decades as maybe some of the growth has been offset, some of the either population growth or just growth in some of the power usage devices has been offset by efficiency gains, but that's changing. And we're seeing the electrification trends again, around cooking around cleaning around heating and cooling, certainly around transportation, super early innings there. But it's creating these incredible opportunities for mismatch of supply and demand. And in particular, as more severe weather and volatile weather patterns pick up, that is putting dramatic stress on the grid. And so I don't -- again, we couldn't be in a better place at a better time with the products and solutions that we've assembled here. We have a lot of work to do, obviously, to deploy those to great effect, to build out these ecosystems for homeowners and business owners. We're working very hard on that. And the work is the investment level we're talking about here, and that is what York was referring to, certainly in the -- throughout the year, 350 to 400 basis points dilution to EBITDA margin.
York Ragen: For Energy Technologies.
Aaron Jagdfeld: For Energy Technologies.
York Ragen: Having said all that, we start expecting to increase our EBITDA margins from 2023 to 2024.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Good point.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is open.
Stephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning gentlemen.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning.
Stephen Gengaro: So two things for me. The first -- and I'm not sure if you're able to comment, but when you talk about that margin drag from the new energy technology side, and you sort of painted this picture at your Analyst Day, but should we expect that to start to dissipate in 2025?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, absolutely. And then the idea, as we laid out -- and we're still on our path here. But the idea, as we laid out in September at the Investor Day is that we would be at breakeven. We would start to achieve breakeven levels in that business in 2026. So you will start to see an abatement of that dilution impact. It's just not going to happen this year. So it really starts in 2025 and it accelerates.
York Ragen: 2026 is what we would.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Cut in half by 2026, right? Exactly.
Operator: One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Mark Strouse: Yes. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking our questions. I wanted to start with the gross margin guide for 2024, 37%. That would be the highest since 2020. I assume a good part of that is driven by mix. Can you talk about your expectations for pricing that are embedded in that? And then just a quick clarification question, if I could. Residential revenue in 4Q grew 1%. I think you said that home standby grew maybe upwards of 10% and the Energy Tech business grew as well. If that's true, what was the offset to get to 1% growth?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So, let me unpack that. So it was mostly portable gens in Q4, again, with a really soft power outage environment and no major events.
York Ragen: And a tough comp last year.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And a tough comp last year.
York Ragen: Here and in Europe.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Correct. Yes. And the European side of that as well, to York's point, the Russia-Ukraine war, they just they haven't really -- some of the energy concerns, security concerns haven't come to a pass there. And as a result, we saw -- we've seen portable gens really come off and also tour products were soft. We said -- we called this out throughout the year last year, we had a tough year with our tour products business. So, that was also soft. But that was offset by 10% growth in HSP and some growth also in the clean energy business. On the margin question, I'll just -- I'll touch on the price piece of that real quick, and then York can kind of round out the discussion. But it's small. I mean we got a little bit of price in there this year, just to cover some of the additional costs that we've seen around the investments that we've had to make as we scale the business, but they were quite modest, I would say, in terms of price. There's no big price. So the rest of it--
York Ragen: I'd say half of that gross margin increase that you referred to is, in fact, mix, obviously, as resi and home standby grow faster than our C&I business, that will be a tailwind to gross margin growth. The other half is really cost continuing to abate the realization of the cost that we're experiencing were, I'd say, in the beginning of 2023, we were still feeling the supply chain pressures that spilled over from 2022 into 2023, those are largely -- we won't see that in 2024 here. Logistics costs, I think we were as those costs build over from 2022 into our inventory as we sell through that inventory, that headwind that won't be a headwind. As we ramp up our production in our plants, we'll have obviously favorable overhead absorption, lower warehousing and storage costs as we bring our inventory levels down, that's sort of behind the scenes, there's a lot of -- we don't need as much warehousing space to store the inventory anymore. So, that builder costs will come down. Just general plant efficiencies. And then we always have our profitability enhancement program that is -- it's sort of part of our DNA now that we cascade cost reduction initiatives across the company throughout the company. And we have goals for those initiatives and projects that we believe we'll realize in the second half of the year. So, the cost side of it is an important side of it as well in terms of the gross margin improvement.
Operator: Our next question comes from Donovan Schafer with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Donovan Schafer: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I want to ask for some of the softness on the C&I side of the business. In the release, you mentioned it also applies -- of course, there's telecom and the rental accounts is kind of what comes first in the order of significance, it seems like. But the beyond has become increasingly interesting. And I believe in chance at rock has been an important part of that. I believe it goes into that bucket. Correct me if I'm wrong on that. And so I'm curious if you can comment on what you're seeing in the beyond standby and kind of the weakness there? If it is tied to enchanted rock kind of when that agreement ends? I believe it was either expiring this in 2023 or 2024. If you expect that to be renewed, and if you can comment at all on potential for data center demand being helpful. I know you have -- I believe you have the largest natural gas generator for data center back up. So any color on those would be appreciated. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Donovan. So yes, I think it would be good to maybe spend a few minutes on the C&I side. We -- that business has been on an absolute tear over the last three years, CAGR close to 30%. It's a $1.5 billion asset for us today globally. It is a truly global business. And in fact, we have a lot of long-term conviction there. As evidenced by we broke ground on a new plant here in Wisconsin just here in the fourth quarter because we see the long-term need for additional capacity as the market grows. Specifically, we have always seen certain cycles in the C&I markets. We've been serving the -- I'll start with telecom kind of work my way through the walk here on kind of the three different areas we called out specifically in the prepared remarks. But I'll start with telecom. It's been an important vertical for us. Historically, around 10% of C&I. We had a really strong year -- a really strong year in 2022, with telecom, we started to see that soften up in the back half of this year. We called that earlier this year. So it kind of fell in line with what we saw. But I think we were more hopeful that it would rebound more quickly here in 2024, and right now, all evidence based on kind of -- you can look at any of the transcripts for many of the major wireless carriers. We're a Tier 1 supplier to all of them. They've all kind of cut their CapEx guide year-over-year by roughly 10%, call it. So I think that's kind of a proxy for what we're seeing to some degree in telecom. But we've seen this movie before. We've been serving that market for 40 years. And they tend to cycle on and off of CapEx. Some of it is the pacing of the build-out of the network. Some of it is they're balancing other capital priorities, sometimes M&A, sometimes other things. So we've seen that before. That will come back, absolutely. And we feel like that's just a cycle we're going to get through here in 2024. The other one is the rental accounts, the national rental accounts in particular. Again, we're a major supplier to all of them. And you've seen a couple of the rental customers come out, rental accounts come out and say that their CapEx is going to be lower year-over-year. So we're kind of -- we're kind of working off of that, those types of guidances. And in particular, there's been a pretty heavy refleeting cycle over the last few years in the categories that we supply, in particular, in Power & Light. So where you've got temporary power or temporary lighting, those are the products we manufacture and put into those channels. They've gone through a heavy refi leading cycle. And now they've got to wait for the utilization rates to kind of get to where they need them to be before they start kind of purchasing new equipment. So again, we've seen that cycle about three times in our ownership and our participation in that market over the last decade plus years. So that's just cycle. And then the last one is beyond standby. That is an area that's been very interesting. It's grown very quickly. We have customers like in channel rock [ph] in there. They're not the only ones. We've got others that we sell a lot of these generators and in particular, on the gas side, where we would sell a typical gas generator for emergency backup, customers are finding that there's additional utility and value that they can deploy that generator in perhaps a grid support type program, right? So time of use program or some other kind of demand response type program, and they can help monetize the asset in a way that they couldn't before. They had to think of it purely as a kind of a -- it was really a disaster response type purchase before, kind of an insurance policy. And so not something that would necessarily create a return year after year, right? I mean it obviously would give you a return, if you experience an outage, that's infrequent use. This is a way now to -- as natural gas prices have stayed low, electricity prices continue to rise, that has been a very interesting growth opportunity. I still relatively small in the context of everything we do, but it's been growing very quickly, and we've called it out over the last couple of years. Underpinned by Generac as an important customer there. But also data centers, these are smaller gas gens, so they're used more in edge data centers, not necessarily hyperscale. Hyperscale data centers are still going to be using very large diesel gens that are manufactured by our competitors. We're not in that business today. So we're really serving more of the edge data center markets or those data center operators that want to use those assets in a monetized fashion. You wouldn't be able to do that economically with diesel. You can do it economically with gas, but it takes a lot more gens to get to the same level of protection, because the density, the power density of each generator for gas is lower than it is for diesel. That's just a -- that's a physics thing. You can't get around that. But that's -- it's still a great market opportunity. We just -- what we called out this morning in the prepared remarks there, is with a higher interest rate environment, we're just seeing those projects get pushed out the time lines, right? So we think it's temporary. We think it will return when interest rates kind of return to a more normal level. Do we know when that is? No. I think you listened to economists and we see a lot of them and hear a lot of them, it's anywhere between zero rate cuts and 12 this year. I don't know. Take your -- pick your number, but we're watching that. We're seeing kind of what goes on in that environment, but we do think that as rates come down, that obviously changes, I think, the -- not only the economics around those projects, but shouldn't bring some of those projects that have been delayed back into the mix.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Kashy Harrison: Hi. Good morning, all, and thanks for taking the question. So maybe just sticking with C&I since we're talking about it. Aaron, as you pointed out, you guys have been serving telecom for, I think, you said 40 years and rental companies for a really long time. So how long does it typically take for the spending to recover on average? Is this something where it drops and stays down for a year, two years, three years? Just maybe help us think about that. And then similarly, following up on this topic of interest rates, can you walk us through the level of rates that drove weakness in that segment? Was it when we got the 5% on the benchmark. Was it another level -- just trying to think -- and just trying to think through if we get to 3%, is that when the segment is back? Is it 4% is at 2%? Just some thought around the level of rates and how it impacts the beyond standby business. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Kash. So with respect to the telecon rental cycles, just kind of how we've seen that historically, they play out in like four to six quarters generally is kind of how it plays out. There can be unique situation we had, as an example, when consolidation has happened historically in the telecom industry, an acquisition of Sprint by T-Mobile, that kind of thing or merger, those types of situations. Those can be more unique. Those -- whenever there's major acquisitions, that usually creates a pause in CapEx as the carriers do their integration activities, and they try and rationalize what they've acquired in terms of the assets and the networks and how they want to deploy that going forward from a strategy standpoint. But typically, four to six quarters. And similarly, on the rental side, those refleeting cycles can be a year or two, depending on the category, depending on the customer, depending on the market. Sometimes they're influenced in oil and gas, as oil and gas prices go up, that can mean better utilization of the equipment in certain regions, where they're used in those applications. And so the timing can vary, but I would say pretty reliably. Historically, we've seen four to six quarters. The beyond standby -- sorry.
York Ragen: I'm going to say because we sell direct, you tend to see it quickly too. Like do they turn it, they can turn it off fast or if they can turn it on fast. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Really good point. Yes, we tend to see them while their capital spending, their purchase orders can be, as York said, it can be pretty abrupt both on and off. So we watch that very closely. One of the reasons, we're expanding capacity in C&I, the range of product, we're aimed at actually is what we would refer to as our midrange product, which really goes after that telecom market and some of that temporary power market for the rental markets as well. It's kind of the mid-range products. And that's where we see -- we are absolutely the strongest manufacturer there in North America in terms of our share and our aggressive stance with these customers. We have an outsized share with these segments, which is maybe why we're getting hurt a little bit more than perhaps some of our competitors in some of the -- in C&I in 2024. Some of our competitors are a little more focused on the hyperscale data centers. As I said before, we don't have products there. So I think some of the way we're looking at the markets in 2024, maybe differ from some of our competitors as a result. To answer your question on kind of what interest rate level kind of impacts the beyond standby market, we kind of saw projects starting to kind of elongate in the cycle. It's new to us. So we haven't been through a rate a higher rate environment there with that product category, so it's new. So we've got a lot of learning cycles there. We're trying to get under our belt. So I can't give you an exact rate, because the one thing we do know is that every project pencils out differently in every market. It really depends on the local utility costs in the market. It depends on the use case of the products in a particular market, the end customer, the project size, there are just a ton of factors. So I would tell you that I don't know that there's like a specific interest rate level where we could say, we called it being cooling off and vice versa, a specific interest rate level where we would say, if we get to 3.5% that it will turn back on. I think a lot of that's just going to depend on economics improving in particular markets, and there's just a ton of factors that go into each one.
Operator: One moment for our question. Our next question comes from Joseph Osha with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Joseph Osha: Thanks for taking my question. I have two product questions for you. The first one relates to some of the DC generators that you were talking about as products to be coupled with storage. I'm curious if we can get an update there. And second, in terms of the storage strategy, given the time line you're talking about in the micros, I know you still have the pipe architecture out there. What can you tell us in particular about how you -- what your outlook is for AC couple storage and whether we might see you selling storage alongside other people's inverters at some point during 2024 as we wait for the updated silicon product to come? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Good questions, all of those. I think -- so on the DC generator question, that was a very small product that we launched a couple of years ago. We didn't see a ton of receptivity to it. It really was aimed at people who truly wanted to be unplugged from the grid, be isolated, independent from the grid. And it's a small host of customers. What we actually think is probably a better opportunity going forward is to take our existing AC product, AC generator products in an AC-coupled environment and allow the generator to act as a as a battery charger through an AC coupling as opposed to a DC. So, it's just -- it's a little bit -- it's not quite as efficient, but it allows us to leverage the AC generator platform, which in terms of our cost structure, is, frankly, just -- it's just better because we just -- we have scale there, we can offer better value to customers, even though we might be taking away a little bit of value in terms of the AC generators are a little bit louder. They maybe use a little -- consume a little more fuel, but not materially. So, that kind of direction we're headed strategically there is kind of moving away from the DC generator product to the AC generators, but it's a really small part of our product line. The broader question, and you're asking kind of an AC coupling, we have AC coupling capabilities today with the Pika system. We can take the battery as a stand-alone with the Pika inverter, we can AC couple it to competitors' inverters. That's not the most efficient architecture, so as we introduce new products later this year, the next-generation storage products, we're going to improve the capability for AC coupling and make that a more, I'll call it, a better experience, a more sophisticated experience, a lower cost experience going forward. And then of course, that sets us up nicely as we go forward with the microinverter products into 2025. And we're going to continue to offer the Pika products. I mean there are -- if you're doing a clean sheet implementation, we still believe that DC coupling is the most efficient -- round trip efficient way to do that. And so we think there's a place in the architecture for that system, at least for now. But as we roll micro-inverters out and as we continue to build out our strategy and have success, I think the market will tell us directionally where we need to go. I think you, in particular, pointed out trying to support both architectures going forward is a heavy load to do, and we would probably tend to agree with you on that. But again, we've got a long way to go before we're kind of proficient in the AC coupled solutions with the micro inverter solutions. There's some very capable products in market today, and it's taken us a long time to get to market because we are going to have a product that we're proud to put our name on, and that will stand the test of time from a reliability standpoint for our customers. And we're working through that. It's part of the big investment that we've been talking about, this 350 to 400 basis point drag. It's a piece of that on EBITDA margins, but we're committed to it. We think that there's a huge opportunity for us to be successful in that going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Levy with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: [indiscernible] on for Jordan. Thanks for taking my question. As it relates to the dealer count, I think you closed the year with 8,700 and we have talked about the desire to bring that number closer to 10,000 over the coming years. So, can you maybe talk to the work you're doing there and some of the sticking points that makes it more challenging to bring that number up? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, absolutely. Great question. And we've had some eye-popping increases over the last couple of years in dealer counts. 2023 was a more muted year, right? We kind of flatlined in 2023. Part of that is, I think, the large increase that we saw a little over 2,000 dealers being added in the years leading up to 23%, you've got, I think, as you would imagine, you've got a process there that we -- our dealer count, by the way, is on a net basis, right? So -- and we basically -- we don't count a dealer for the purposes of that account if they haven't bought anything from us in a 12-month period. So we're maybe a little bit hard on ourselves in the way we think about dealer counts and the way we talk about it. If you were to actually look at the total number of dealers in our network, it's more than 8,700. But the 10,000 is a target on a net basis and we are still targeting that. The headwinds to that this year, in particular, where I think just the kind of rollover of some of the ads that we had, we still had a lot of really nice gross adds to the dealer count. So we're bringing new dealers in -- but we -- as we call them, we call them dark doors. When a dealer hasn't bought from us in 12 months, we put them in that dark door category, and that is an offset to any gross adds that we have. So it's kind of churn, if you will. There's a churn that happens there. We had more churn in 2023, churn of a lot of those dealers that were added over the last couple of years. That also happens when you have kind of softer power outage environments, which certainly, as we talked about Q4 being a softer environment, that's a headwind to adding dealers, it's tough to get people interested in the category if the demand isn't there necessarily, right? So we saw in-home consultations drop-off in Q4. So those things present headwinds. I think longer-term, as we've looked at this, we built this from basically zero, 20 years ago to 8,700 today to get to that 10,000, we're deploying an army of people that are going out there and engaging with primarily electrical contractors, but we've started to open the aperture on that to also include HVAC contractors. One interesting trend that I think many people have probably noted is you're seeing kind of a consolidation of kind of home services businesses. So electrical contractors getting into the HVAC business or vice versa or into plumbing or into home automation. Kind of this broadening of the suite of services that a contracting business will offer. It's giving us a nice opportunity to get introduced to new kind of cohorts in the contracting business. And then on top of that, I would tell you that bringing Ecobee into the fold, they have upwards of 14,000 HVAC contracting relationships just with the 3.5 million homes that they put devices into and that is kind of a really important kind of feeding ground for us in terms of a bench, if you want to think of it that way, where we can add and bring new dealers in to sell to. So working all of those pads, I'm very confident we're going to get to 10,000 as the category continues to expand in the years ahead. So we haven't kind of put a pin on the date that's going to happen, but it's definitely going to happen as the category continues to grow.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chip Moore with ROTH MKM. Your line is open.
Chip Moore: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to visibility for C&I with some of that cyclical deterioration you've seen since the Investor Day. Aaron, is there maybe a potential for infrastructure investments to kick in here at some point and start to help drive growth there? And then any implications for those three-year growth targets you've laid out? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, it's a great question. I think in terms of infrastructure, obviously, anything that moves the needle there will certainly help shorten the cycle, kind of off cycle for the rental equipment for sure. The telecom cycle, I think, is going to play out. Some of that is it's kind of the installation bandwidth that those network kind of operators have to build out, like the speed at which they can build out their networks. There is some -- we ran into some headwinds there with some specific customers just being able to kind of keep pace with installations according to their schedules that they had originally set for themselves. We were giving them product according to the schedules. You could probably say, okay, maybe there's some field inventory there as a result. We're not really calling it that way because it's not really a business we talk about inventory being carried for, but that's somewhat the issue there with maybe one or two of those customers, but I think that cycle -- I don't know if there's much we can do or that we would see to point to kind of that cycle accelerating. I think it's just going to have to play out the way that it plays out. But I think, again, the C&I cycles we've seen this movie before. So it doesn't really worry us. The visibility question is a good one. We -- unfortunately, because these are big customers that kind of in our world, they wheel big pencils, right? They've got -- that's probably a dated term now, but they can write big, big people. They can write big POs or they can stop writing big POs and we get forecasts from them and we listen to the same things that others listen to in terms of their CapEx guidance because that obviously is the best proxy that we can use and we have as much dialogue with them as we can about what are their build-out plans for networks and what are their build-out plans for fleet when it comes to the rental customers. And we know, we have some visibility in the pipeline for beyond standby projects as we're quoting them. But unfortunately, visibility, it's probably the weakest area of visibility for us in terms of our C&I business. When you look at the strength we called out in C&I which is offsetting some of this weakness and won't offset all of it, obviously, because we're saying C&I is going to be down for the year 10%. But offsetting that, our -- we call it our IDC, our independent distribution network is we continue to see growth there. In fact, in some of the distribution partners, we actually have acquired a number of them over the last several years. And that's given us really clear insight and really good visibility actually into some local markets. And that is much more of a quotation business. And so we have, I think, much better visibility in that part of the business on C&I, but not as much, unfortunately, in some of these national account customers that can be I think, a lot more volatile in their order patterns.
York Ragen: And there are some pockets around the globe that we're seeing growth as well the offset some of that softness. But I think the last part of your question was, how do we feel about C&I in the LRP that we -- the long-range plan that we rolled out during Investor Day. And I think -- in talking to the team that runs that business, it's -- I think because they these select certain customers that we're referring to in telecom rental beyond standby maybe they turned things off a little bit harder than we were expecting when we were walking through the Investor Day materials, but we think they think we think that they can turn them back on just as fast. So...
Aaron Jagdfeld: They have put a cycle in the LRP exactly.
York Ragen: But maybe it just was a little bit harder down in '24 than maybe the rig thought. But they think they're going to be turning things back on in line with the LRP in '25, '26, call it.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Keith Housum: Good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me in here. Just one question in terms of the interest rates. This time, focus more on the HSPs. Can you guys remind me in terms of how critical is the interest rate environment to, I guess, the growth or decline of HSPs in any given quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Keith. And sorry to get you in here at the end. I made you wait, 1.5 hours. But yes, the interest rate, actually, we've said this a couple of times, I think as we talk through this, I don't know if we've talked about it publicly as much, but it's not a high -- the home standby category, in particular, is not a highly interest rate-sensitive category specifically. Now obviously, the impacts, the higher rates have on the macroeconomic environment be the job security issues for people or kind of other challenges with maybe around the way they feel about the way people feel about spending money on large ticket purchases that does have an impact kind of on the margins, but...
York Ragen: It's not a highly financed.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's not a highly financed purchase, oddly enough. Now that said, we do have a third-party financing program through Synchrony, which has been a great program. It grew like almost 50% last year. So we are seeing more evidence of people using finance. But then when you peel the onion back, the number one thing that we see people using is the 18-month same as cash. So -- we don't think that -- we think that that's not necessarily evidence they're just deferring their payment
York Ragen: So the cost was…
Aaron Jagdfeld: That doesn't cost me I think they're going to use somebody else's money for that 1.5 years. So I don't think that all indications are that -- and you look at the kind of demographic that we sell into primarily there. And these are people that are -- there are older Americans who -- they have got their home paid for in a lot of cases, they're probably retired in cases. So for them, it's more about the -- protecting their home, protecting their safety protecting their families. And I think that it's -- frankly, it's more about that than it is maybe about where interest rates are at any point in time.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Kris Rosemann for closing remarks.
Kris Rosemann: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2024 earnings results with you in early May. Thank you again, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2023 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kris Rosemann, Senior Manager, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kris Rosemann: Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today’s call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Kris. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect improving operating performance led primarily by continued strength in C&I product shipments and sequential growth in home standby generator shipments. Year-over-year, overall net sales decreased 2% to $1.07 billion with core sales declining 4% during the quarter. Residential product sales decreased 15% as compared to the prior year, representing a significant improvement in sales decline from the prior two quarters as field inventory levels of home standby generators continued to decline during the quarter and portable generator sales decreased from a strong prior year comparison that included the impact of Hurricane Ian. Global C&I product sales increased approximately 24% to an all-time quarterly record with growth across nearly all regions. We returned to year-over-year margin expansion for gross and adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter, driven by lower input costs and continued production efficiencies. In addition, we generated significant free cash flow during the quarter, allowing us to complete approximately $100 million of share repurchases. Third quarter home standby shipments grew at a strong sequential rate, but declined on a year-over-year basis as we continued our efforts to reduce field inventory levels. Power outage activity in the U.S. was well above the long-term baseline average during the quarter despite not having the benefit of a major outage event, which we had experienced in the third quarter of each of the 3 previous years. Against a strong comparable period, the higher outage activity combined with well-publicized grid stability issues drove home consultations in the quarter meaningfully higher from the prior year and marked the second highest quarter on record behind only the third quarter of 2021, which included the impact of Hurricane Ida and was only months after the Texas deep-freeze major event in February of 2021. Our residential dealer count was approximately 8,700 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 200 from the prior year and over 2,000 from pre-COVID levels. Additionally, we continue to make good progress in training non-dealer contractors as our initiatives to grow installation capacity maintained positive momentum in the third quarter. Activations which are a proxy for installations improved at a solid sequential rate in the quarter, but declined from a strong comparable period in 2022 that marked an all-time high for a third quarter. Activations in the month of October continued this strong sequential improvement, providing further confidence that the home standby market has formed and is holding a new and higher baseline level of demand. The number of home standby generators in our distribution channels declined further in the quarter as we continue to make progress in reducing field inventories. As previously disclosed, certain regions and channels are at healthier levels of field inventory than others and field inventory levels of certain models are declining more quickly than others. Although we continue to undership end market demand during the third quarter, the gap between shipments and activations narrowed meaningfully as compared to the first half of the year. These factors, together with the continued strength in leading indicators of demand during the third quarter support our projection for home standby generator sales, returning to growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 while still working to reduce field inventory to more sustainable levels. In addition to the positive near-term momentum that is building within the home standby market, we remain confident in the long-term outlook we shared at our recent Investor Day in September. The megatrends that are driving awareness for backup power remain as compelling as ever. As electrification trends drive demand forward and the adoption of intermittent renewable power generation accelerates, we expect that consumers will become even more reliant on an electrical grid that is increasingly susceptible to power outages caused by the combined threats of more severe and volatile weather and deteriorating supply-demand dynamics. We believe home standby generators will remain the most effective and economical solution for whole home resiliency for many years to come as homeowners look for peace of mind to address the impact of increasingly frequent and longer duration power outages. In addition to the stronger-than-expected home standby shipments, our Residential Energy Technology Products and Solutions returned to year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter as continued strength in Ecobee sales more than offset weakness in shipments of our power cell energy storage systems as broader market conditions for residential solar and energy storage deteriorated further in the quarter. As a result of these softer end market conditions, we now expect full year 2023 gross sales for residential energy technology to be approximately 10% below our prior guidance of $300 million. Ecobee continues to take market share with strategic retail partners in the smart thermostat market and the team successfully launched our new smart doorbell camera in the month of October. In addition to providing increased levels of homeowner engagement with our home energy management platform, the smart doorbell camera showcases Ecobee’s ability to drive innovation and differentiated product development. Ecobee’s strong product development capabilities, combined with their focus on creating an exceptional user experience are central to the continued build-out of our home energy ecosystem. Also during the third quarter, we announced the opening of a new engineering center of excellence in Reno, Nevada. This facility will house the development and testing of batteries, switches, power electronics and other clean energy solutions as we continue to invest in the R&D infrastructure and world-class talent that is required to develop and test the innovative residential energy technology solutions we are bringing to the market in the years ahead. Additionally, our grid services team was awarded a $50 million grant from the Department of Energy in the month of October as part of the grid resilience and innovation partnerships program to pursue a project demonstrating the efficient building electrification can be achieved while minimizing system overload, reliability issues and the need for infrastructure upgrades. We’re proud to receive this validation of our vision to utilize multiple energy technologies to support homeowners while providing valuable products and services that benefit both the grid and homeowners. I now want to provide commentary on our C&I products, which continue to outperform our expectations in the quarter. Domestic C&I product sales grew at a robust rate compared to the prior year as strength in shipments to customers for beyond standby applications and industrial distributors more than offset weaknesses in the telecom channel during the quarter. Shipments of natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects again grew at an exceptional rate during the third quarter. We believe we are in the very early innings of this compelling new market opportunity as ongoing grid stability concerns and volatile energy markets drive interest in these solutions. These emerging applications are just one of the many ways that we’re leveraging our position as the leading provider of natural gas generators to support increased adoption of energy technology solutions in C&I end markets. We also continue to build an increasingly comprehensive solution set to enable the deployment of our products in multi-asset applications, such as pairing our smart grid ready generators with our emerging C&I storage, connectivity, advanced controls and grid services platforms. Shipments of C&I generators through our North American distributor channel also grew again at a strong rate. Quoting activity remained resilient in the quarter, growing on a year-over-year basis and supporting our expectations for continued growth in this important channel that serves a wide range of end markets. As previously disclosed, order patterns from rental companies have moderated after several quarters of exceptional performance. And third quarter sales to our national and independent rental equipment customers were approximately flat from the prior year. Despite the expected near-term softness, we continue to expect that this historically cyclical end market has a substantially long-term runway for growth given the critical need for future infrastructure-related projects that leverage our products sold to this channel. As expected, sales to national telecom customers declined during the third quarter as compared to a strong prior year comparison. While we continue to expect shipment and order trends for these products to be softer in the coming quarters, we believe investment in telecom infrastructure remains a secular trend as global tower and network hub counts further expand and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications requires backup power for resiliency. While we are seeing near-term softness in the telecom and rental channels as previously expected, the longer term growth opportunity for backup power and energy technology solutions in C&I end markets remain significant. To help serve the expected future demand growth, we recently announced an expansion project in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, which is scheduled to be complete in early 2025, and will expand our manufacturing capabilities and capacity for a range of C&I stationary products for the North American market. Total sales for our International segment increased 14% year-over-year during the third quarter with the combined impact of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency effects contributing approximately 11% sales growth. Core total sales growth was driven by strength in important long-term growth markets such as India, Latin America, Australia and the Middle East, partially offset by lower portable generator sales in Europe as energy security concerns in the region have moderated from peak levels seen in prior quarters. International growth remains an important strategic focus as we replicate the Generac playbook in a growing number of regions around the world. Geographic expansion, together with the increasing breadth of our product portfolio of backup power and energy technology solutions is expected to drive continued growth in the segment. Power resiliency concerns related to increasingly severe and volatile weather and rising supply/demand imbalances are not unique to North America. And as the global energy transition accelerates amid rising geopolitical tensions, we will continue to support businesses and homeowners in solving for their energy resiliency needs. In closing this morning, our third quarter results and reiteration of our full year 2023 overall net sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance reflect improving operating performance and the hard work and strong execution by our teams. We believe we are moving closer to more sustainable levels of field inventory for home standby generators as we experienced positive momentum in key fundamental metrics during the third quarter, supporting our expectation for a return to year-over-year sales growth for these products in the fourth quarter and 2024. These sales growth expectations, together with the return to margin expansion and robust free cash flow generation, validate our commitment to a long-term focus on executing our powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy. We will continue to invest for future growth and position Generac growing residential and C&I energy ecosystems to drive value for homes and businesses around the world as detailed at our Investor Day in September. The megatrends that support the longer term demand for growth profile for backup power and energy technology solutions remain firmly intact, and we maintain our conviction that Generac is uniquely positioned to lead the evolution to a more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy future. I’ll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on our third quarter results and our remaining outlook for the year. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at our third quarter 2023 results in more detail, overall net sales decreased 2% to $1.07 billion during the third quarter of 2023 as compared to $1.09 billion in the prior year third quarter. The combination of contributions from recent acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 2% net favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the third quarter by product class, residential product sales declined 15% to $565 million as compared to $664 million in the prior year. As Aaron discussed in detail, lower shipments of home standby and portable generators drove this decline in residential product sales. To a lesser extent, shore and clean energy products also contributed to the year-over-year decline, partially offset by growth in Ecobee Smart Thermostat sales. Commercial and industrial product sales for the third quarter of 2023 increased 24% to $385 million as compared to $311 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from recent acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 5% revenue growth in the quarter. This strong core sales growth was driven by an increase in domestic shipments to industrial distributors and direct customers for beyond standby applications as well as a more modest growth in international shipments of C&I products. As expected, shipments to our telecom customers were down sharply compared to prior year. Net sales for other products and services increased 7% to $121 million as compared to $113 million in the third quarter of 2022. Core sales growth of 6% was primarily due to growth in sales of parts and accessories, company-owned industrial distributor project and service revenue and energy technology grid services revenue. Gross profit margin was 35.1% compared to 33.2% in the prior year third quarter as a result of lower raw material and logistics costs, production efficiencies and marginally higher pricing compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by the impact of unfavorable sales mix, primarily driven by lower home standby shipments in the current year quarter. Operating expenses decreased $3 million or 1% as compared to the third quarter of 2022. As highlighted in our reconciliation schedules in the earnings release, the current year quarter included a $22 million provision for legal charges related to certain Ecobee patent litigation matters. The prior year includes $55 million of charges comprised of $18 million of bad debt expense related to a clean energy product customer that filed for bankruptcy and a $37 million charge for clean energy product warranty-related matters. Excluding these items in the current and prior year, operating expenses increased by $31 million or 14%, primarily driven by increased employee and marketing costs in the current year period and a favorable contingent consideration adjustment in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $189 million or 17.6% of net sales in the third quarter as compared to $184 million or 16.9% of net sales in the prior year. This improved EBITDA percent was primarily driven by higher gross margins as compared to the prior year, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as we continue to invest for future growth. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 6% to $894 million in the quarter as compared to $947 million in the prior year, with minimal favorable impact from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $160 million, representing 17.9% of total sales as compared to $160 million in the prior year or 16.9% of total sales. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 14% to $208 million in the quarter as compared to $183 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 3% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interest was $28 million or 13.6% of net sales as compared to $24 million or 13.2% of net sales in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2023 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $60 million as compared to $58 million in the third quarter of 2022. In addition to the items just discussed, the current year net income includes approximately $9 million of additional interest expense compared to the prior year due to higher borrowings and interest rates. GAAP income taxes during the current year third quarter were $19 million or an effective tax rate of 24.3% as compared to $12 million or an effective tax rate of 16.1% for the prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the prior year quarter, including certain favorable discrete tax items and a larger benefit from equity compensation as compared to the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.97 in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $0.83 in the prior year. The strong year-over-year increase in GAAP earnings per share relative to growth in GAAP net income was primarily driven by a lower share count in the current year period, coupled with the redeemable non-controlling interest redemption value adjustment that was recorded in the prior year period. See our earnings per share footnote for further information on our EPS calculations. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $102 million in the current year quarter or $1.64 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $112 million in the prior year or $1.75 per share. Cash flow from operations was $140 million as compared to minus $56 million in the prior year third quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $117 million as compared to minus $73 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in free cash flow was primarily due to a significant use of cash for working capital in the prior year period that did not repeat in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher interest payments and capital expenditures. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.58 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2.6x on an as-reported basis. Additionally, during the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 876,000 shares of our common stock for $100 million. There is approximately $178 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of the third quarter. With that, I will now provide further comments on our remaining outlook for 2023. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are maintaining our overall net sales outlook for the full year 2023. We continue to expect overall net sales for the full year to decline between minus 10% to minus 12% as compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 2% net favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. Looking at the product class mix, given the outperformance of C&I products and softness in shore and clean energy products during the third quarter, we now expect the mix of C&I product shipments for the full year to be approximately 100 basis points higher relative to our previous guidance, with the offset in residential product shipment mix. Our gross margin expectations for the full year 2023 are also unchanged as we still anticipate approximately 100 basis points of gross margin improvement over 2022 levels, driven primarily by favorable price cost benefits, partially offset by the unfavorable mix impact resulting from lower home standby generator sales for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are still expected to be approximately 15.5% to 16.5% for the full year, implying that fourth quarter 2023 EBITDA margins would be over 20%, a significant improvement over prior year fourth quarter. We expect to generate strong operating free cash flow in the fourth quarter, resulting in an adjusted net income to free cash flow conversion at well over 100% for the full year as inventory levels are projected to further moderate. This return to robust free cash flow generation allows for continued capital allocation optionality as we move through the remainder of the year. We are also providing updated guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted EPS and free cash flow for the full year 2023. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, add-back items should be reflected net of tax using the expected effective tax rate. For 2023, our GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 25%. Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $95 million compared to the prior guidance of approximately $92 million due to higher projected interest rates and borrowings. Our capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. Depreciation expense is still forecast to be approximately $62 million in 2023. GAAP intangible amortization expense is now expected to be approximately $104 million during the year as compared to the previous guidance of $102 million. Stock compensation expense is still expected to be between $40 million to $43 million for the year. Given the share repurchases executed during the third quarter of 2023, our full year weighted average diluted share count is now expected to decrease to approximately 62.3 million shares. And finally, this 2023 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we’d like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.
Tommy Moll: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Tom.
Tommy Moll: Aaron, maybe no big surprise here, I wanted to start on your comments regarding the home standby field inventory. I think I heard you say that units were lower quarter-over-quarter. And so my related question was, can you give us an update on the times normal? I think last quarter, it was 1.2 to 1.3. Where do we sit today? And what additional commentary, can you give us, in particular, on the wholesale and retail channels? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Tom. Yes, we did say this morning that inventories continue – field inventories continue to come down. And the way we phrased it, they are reaching a more sustainable level because we’re definitely seeing areas as we noted, I think, not only at our Investor Day, but maybe even on the last call, where we have certain regions and certain models, certain channels like our dealer channel, in particular, that are or feeling like we’re kind of abnormal. And they are back to the whole question of what is normal, right? I mean we picked a pre-COVID kind of average to say what that is. And so we continue to work towards that and making good progress. We’re still undershipping the market in terms of overall end market demand. So – but it’s narrowing up. It’s not nearly what it was earlier this year. We were severely under shipping the market earlier this year. That’s why the results were what they were. And as we get closer to kind of that, I would call it, in-line shipping to market end market demand, you’re seeing the impact of that on the results, both in the gross margin level as well as EBITDA margins. We’re able to really focus on improving the efficiency in our factories because we’re taking up our production rates to get closer to that end market demand. The really good news is we continue to see end market demand remain quite strong for home standby. And that’s in spite of having it’s really kind of a light season relative to the third quarter here. outages in total were above average, the long-term average. And of course, there were a lot of well-publicized articles around potential outages with some of the demand – supply-demand challenges that remain out there. But we feel really good about where the category is at. And we feel like as we’ve been saying all along, as we finish up the year here and we get into 2024, we’re going to be much, much closer to normal at all channels. And so the other part of your question on wholesale and retail, as we’ve said in the past, if you look at all kind of the three major channels as we think about them dealer, wholesale and retail, dealer feels like it’s closer to normal. Wholesale would be next in line and then retail would be a little bit further out, but they are all approaching a more normal level.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Baird. Your line is now open.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Mike. We need to come back to Mike.
York Ragen: Yes. Might have to come back to Mike.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Jeff, are you there?
York Ragen: We try the next one.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We try the next one.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, we can hear you, Chris. Loud and clear.
Christopher Glynn: Right. So I was just curious about dealer and close rate productivity. I know you’re doing a lot with dealers. You had a bit of an explosion during the pandemic, a little bit of a lack of training that you’re catching up on. So just curious how that productivity selling commercial is playing out and what percent of HSB sales go through the dealer channel, where I think you said the inventories are now about normal in fact.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Chris. So the majority of the sales, as we say, more than 50% go through that dealer channel. It’s a really important channel for us. Our wholesale and retail channels are important channels as well, but the dealer channel with 8,700 dealers is clearly a critical area of focus for us. And of course, the bandwidth in that dealer channel around sales and installation and service as the market grows, we’ve got over 3 million units in the field. That’s a really important area. As far as close rates, and that is the channel that we can measure close rates on because we have our PowerPlay sales system is offered through that channel. So it’s a way for them to quote and sell product. And so we get really good visibility into close rates by dealer, by product, by region. And as we said on the last call, close rates have kind of flattened out, and that’s how they have kind of played out similar to that. Actually, I mean, we’ve seen some near-term improvement here, but we’re not ready to call it a new trend up, but the month of October has been relatively good. It’s – you have to think of it in the context, this is a look back, right? So when we talk about close rates, we have a window of time, we look back because it takes time for quotes to mature to a point of – for us to make a call on whether it’s closed as a sale or not. But we are seeing some green shoots there, but we – we’re not ready to quite call it a trend yet. So we’ve still kind of forecasted things here as being somewhat flat. The consumer, obviously, as everybody is well aware, there is some uncertainty out there looming around the consumer in certain big ticket discretionary purchase categories. But as we’ve said, in our category, in particular, outages tend to help us overcome any general macro weakness in the consumer. And that has been the historical case for us. And I think that might be why we saw what we saw in the third quarter is outages were above the long-term average. And so we’ve seen the consumer perform quite well in our category of products. But we’re keeping a very close eye on it. We want to see how things play out here for the balance of the year and into 2024. But we’re encouraged by sales leads for sure. I mean October was another strong – the third quarter was another strong quarter for us, second best quarter ever for us in terms of just sales leads. And so that’s been really encouraging to see in terms of just the interest – the overall interest and awareness in the category.
Christopher Glynn: Close rates maintaining.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Michael Halloran with Baird. Your line is now open.
Aaron Jagdfeld: I have to come back to Mike again.
York Ragen: Yes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, hope for two.
Operator: Alright. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Epic fail going here on the Q&A.
Operator: Alright. Next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Mark Strouse: Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you hear me?
Aaron Jagdfeld: We can hear you, Mark. Thankfully.
Mark Strouse: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. York, you touched on this a bit, but I’m curious on the gross margin upside that was a bit higher than what you were guiding on the last call. Can you just quantify how much of that was driven by mix? I mean it’s encouraging to see that higher despite the higher mix of C&I. But is there something about kind of the mix within the mix versus just kind of something more structural with your cost savings or pricing initiatives?
York Ragen: Yes. No, I mean I think in terms of year-over-year improvement, there price cost has been very nice tailwind really all throughout the year. And I guess the beginning part of the year, we were having, I guess, pretty, pretty significant mix headwinds at the beginning – in the first part of the year that was offsetting that. I think what we’re seeing now in the third quarter is those mix headwinds now are starting to subside as we’re starting to get closer to comping prior year. So the positive price cost that we’ve been recognizing – the vast majority of the gross margin increase is price cost with only a modest I’d say slight impact on mix year-over-year. So I think we’re pleased to see some of those mix headwinds start to subside. And then when you flash forward to Q4 then, we will obviously expect gross margins to continue to improve as we sequentially increase those home standby shipments then we will get mix positive there, and we will see significant year-over-year improvements in gross margin at that point because then you’ll get the benefit of price cost and favorable mix. So we’re pleased with the trajectory of where margins are headed and just like we had guided earlier in the year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is now open. Brian, you line is now open.
Brian Drab: Can you hear me?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, got it, Brian.
Brian Drab: Okay. Well, it’s not on our end, I guess, because you couldn’t hear me at first. Okay. So I have a bunch of questions. Just, I guess, California. I’m curious, we haven’t been talking as much about California lately, but what are you seeing in terms of the longer-term opportunity there? I didn’t feel like the utilities were shutting down power as much lately. What’s the penetration rate penetration level in California today? And what’s the latest thinking on – there is a lot of rumblings around natural gas bands in different cities and counties and how has that affected demand?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Brian, California was always a small-ish market for us in terms of home standby. It grew during the well-publicized power safety shutoff events of a couple of years ago. But the penetration rate is around 2% now, so still quite underpenetrated relative to the – I think, the full average was somewhere like 5.75% across the U.S. So, slightly below that for California, a little less than 2%. So it still represents an area of potential growth. I think those gas bands are pretty localized. And in fact, some of them have actually been overturned in courts of law. So I don’t know where that’s going to ultimately go. We need natural gas as a bridge fuel to get to the other side of the full transition to renewables, gas is going to play. And that gas is a great way to get there in terms of just the cleanliness of that fuel source and the plentiful nature of it to help us to make the transition, the energy transition. So I think it would be very shortsighted to band that gas, but that’s – I know that, that varies location to location. So but still opportunities there. You’re right, though, I would say, in recent quarters, for sure, you haven’t seen the high-profile nature of power safety shutoffs as you maybe saw them a few years ago. We did see some outage activity coming out of the kind of spring storms, winter storms of last year and IHCs were pretty robust in California. So we continue to see growth there. And again, it was a lot less than 1% before, so it’s less than 2% now, so still growing and represents obviously a huge market just in terms of the opportunity in terms of the number of homes in that state.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
George Gianarikas: Hey, guys. Can you hear me?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, we can, George. I guess, George Gianarikas is always powered on, so – good to hear you, George.
George Gianarikas: Quick question on clean energy. Curious as to whether the upheaval in the market there with some of your competitors either accelerates or maybe delay some of the strategy points you talked about at your Analyst Day. Do you see more of an opportunity here near-term? Or does this give you kind of comfort that you have your products coming out in the second half of next year? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, George. It is interesting. I mean, with the – and we said it this morning in the prepared remarks, we’re seeing softness in that solar plus storage, the residential solar plus storage market. Actually, ecobees continue to just – they are posting record quarter after record quarter here, which is pretty amazing. I think new products coming out and they are killing it actually. We’re doing really well with that business, and there is a lot of great things around that. But when it comes to the storage side of the market, which we’re still bullish on long-term, given the structural nature of the grid transition and the policy tailwinds that should be there, we feel like the current environment, while negative, is kind of a, I think, more temporary than permanent. And so – but the good news for us is we have a lot of new product coming next year. So I don’t feel like we’re missing out on maybe what’s going on in the market today by having – our product offering is fine today, but our next-generation product offering is going to – is really going to be – I think set us apart from the competition. I think it’s going to establish us as the leader, we think we can be in that marketplace going forward or a leader. I think we all know we struggled with our – the acquired products initially. And I think we’ve worked very hard and will be working very hard over the next 12 months to bring the new products we have to market. We’ve got a huge team working on that. It’s why the level of investment, as we said at our Investor Day, is so heavy. And we do believe in it long-term. So I don’t think to answer your question directly, I don’t think it changes the trajectory necessarily of anything we’re doing there. But I think it probably does soften maybe the fear of missing out, if you will, the FOMO around maybe not having leading products there today. And we just getting a pause in the market here maybe is just the timing is just good for us. But we expect to be in the market in a big way later next year with our new products, and we’re pretty excited about where we’re going with that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next one comes from the line Donovan Schafer with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Donovan Schafer: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to follow-up on the – on close rates. So one of the things that came across talking to some dealers is with the kind of revamped the marketing campaign you guys launched or talked about at Investor Day and how you’re trying to increase product category awareness among the next generation people, maybe in the 30s to 40s, kind of in the middle of family formation right now. The dealers were saying they are getting more IHCs that they used to – like they used to get IHC before COVID, they get an IHC that go out there, and it was almost always someone 60-year-old or who has retired. It was really easy to schedule because the person didn’t have a day job and this retired individual would have tons of peers who have backup generators. So there was almost no education curve or anything like that. So I’m just curious if you think this increasing amount of IHCs coming from people in their 30s and 40s, where they have to actually schedule around work hours and other considerations and where they maybe don’t know the product category as well. Is that – do you think that, that’s a material factor in close rates still being a bit below where they were historically? And if so, does that mean it could be a longer process to get back to kind of historical highs? Just anything you can – any color you can provide on that would be great.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It’s a great line of questioning, Donovan, and an area that I would say that in the last 12 months, we have been focusing a lot more closely on the IHCs that are coming through. And that really goes hand-in-hand with the pull down in the close rates we saw happened during COVID. We – initially, our explanation around that was all around the long lead times of the product. And I do think that, that had a material effect on – coming off of the high point for close rates where we were to where we dropped down to in – during COVID. There was no doubt in our mind based on the information and feedback that we had that close rates were being impacted negatively by the long lead times for the products. Now, as the lead times have recovered and close rates have recovered, but not to the level that – not nearly to the level they were at, that’s where you start to look at other factors. And so I think you are on to something there, and we have started as I have said over the last 12 months and really dig into this with more vigor. And I think what we found – one of the things that we are concluding is that the category itself. The buyers of the category largely remain fairly concentrated in the demographic that you highlighted, over age 60, people who want to stay in their homes as long as possible. Power outages are more than just an inconvenience as you age in your home. And I think that, that had largely driven the category in the early days. But as the category expands and we reach different levels of penetration, we are now reaching different demographics that are interested in resiliency as much or more perhaps than some of the traditional demographics. We all live in a very digital age today. And I think, again, maybe owing to the pandemic, people are – the way the nature of work, the way we live today is different, right. I mean we are all working in a more hybrid nature. I would wager a bet that some of the folks in the Q&A queue here today, that we can hear anyway, are working from home rather than sitting in an office somewhere. And you can’t do that if – or you can’t do it well if you are in the dark. So, power outages have a bigger impact today on people and on your livelihood and maybe on your children’s ability to be educated. All the things that we have taken for granted for many, many years, we are doing those things from home today. And we are doing it at a time when the grid has become ever more fraught with the challenges in terms of uptime. And we see it. There is some very high-profile examples, but day-in and day-out. There is tens of thousands of people every day in this country that suffer outages. And actually, those numbers are bigger and the outages are lasting longer. And so as we reach deeper across in terms of penetration rate, we are seeing different demographics, but your point is well taken. The learning curve or the education curve that process, the sales process is longer for different demographics that we have – there is more salesmanship, if you will, that has to be done to educate those consumers on the product category and the options that are available. And sometimes, financing is a bigger consideration for younger demographics, right. Older demographics tend to have maybe more readily available funding that they can pay for a project like this, whereas younger demographics may have to arrange for that in a different way, so – and that can elongate the sales process. So, we do think that, that is part of what’s going on today. As we dig and continue to dig deeper, we – Amanda Teder, our Executive VP of Marketing that spoke at the Investor Day is incredibly focused on that. She comes from a consumer product marketing background and understanding very deeply who the potential buyers are and the buyers are of our products is central to not only the messaging around marketing, but just this process of selling and also the process of nurturing, right. We talked about how we nurture sales leads. We have had to adapt our nurturing processes to adjust for some of the newer demographics we are seeing. So, anyway, lot of cool things coming there. We are putting a lot of science behind it. And I feel like we have got an appropriate level of calorie burn against it, but it’s – I think it’s – these are good problems to have. I think longer term, I think we are going to figure them out and it’s going to potentially continue to widen out the category as we grow and the penetration rate grows.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Jon Windham with UBS. Your line is now open.
Jon Windham: Perfect. Thanks. Congrats on a good result. I wanted to dive back into ecobee a little bit. Obviously, it’s a product that’s having quite some success. I am just curious if you could talk through how far along you are in pulling the levers to incentivize installers to sell the value proposition of that product? Is there still more things you can do to incentivize installers there, or do you feel that’s pretty rolled out already? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks Jon. Yes, ecobee has been having a lot of success here recently. I think a lot of that was – I don’t want to be overly basic about the explanation here, but obviously, energy costs continue to rise. And as energy costs go up, I think homeowners are – I think they are in search of ways to save money. And there is a very strong payback on an ecobee smart thermostat. You can save upwards of 40% of your energy costs annually by using a smart thermostat. And this is not a product that you basically just set a regular schedule for that you can remotely check the temperature on. I mean that’s – those are basic features. There are companies out there that are offering those features and calling themselves smart thermostats. Those are not smart thermostats. The ecobee thermostat is different in that. It actually learns your patterns in terms of when you are home, when you are not. There are sensors in the home that give it context around occupancy, and it can adjust for different variables, both heating and cooling, pre-heating, pre-cooling. There are some really cool things that it does. And it looks at energy costs in your market to make some of the decisions it’s making on your behalf or with your input. And so these are, I think really strong and important considerations for why we think the smart thermostat category, in particular, is growing and why ecobee’s solution is the best offering in that category. And that’s something that when you think about, to your question about installers, I mean I think installers they do – they try to offer, I think the value prop or to extend the value prop in their sales process. But I think it really comes down to the homeowner requesting that, right. And I think what installers appreciate mostly is the ease of installation and the level of technical support that they get from ecobee. The level of support from ecobee, whether you are a homeowner or whether you are a contractor installing the product is phenomenal. And that’s what wins the day with an installer. It can win the day with a homeowner as well, but I think for installation, from an installer standpoint, time is money. So, if you’re dealing with a product that doesn’t have great support and you have challenges with that, and you are not able to get answers to the questions you need in a timely fashion, you are wasting time, you are wasting money. If you have an ecobee thermostat and you have a problem or you have a technical question, you can get a response very quickly and a high-quality response at that and so they get incredibly high marks for technical support. I think that’s why installers largely are choosing the product over other options in the marketplace.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We will follow-up with you, Jeff.
Kris Rosemann: Sorry about that.
Operator: Moving on to the next question, your next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Stephen Gengaro: Alright. Thanks. Good morning.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning.
Stephen Gengaro: I tell you my generator has been a lot more reliable than some of these questions so far. So, I was just curious, you talked about underselling demand still so far as you work through the inventory channels. As we think about the dynamics, I know it’s early to tell, but as we think about dynamics into next year, do you think you get back to kind of a more normalized annual growth rate in ‘24?
Kris Rosemann: Yes. I mean obviously, you won’t have the headwinds that we have had with bringing field inventory down. We have been under-shipping that. It will be more normalized. And so just – I mean just in terms of raw shipments, we should see growth that way in that home standby business. Your question maybe is more like will activations grow, installations grow, which is our proxy for I guess sales in terms of the end market that way. We obviously are – we are evaluating market conditions, IHCs. Again, second best on record, so that obviously is a leading indicator, so we got…
Aaron Jagdfeld: But let’s be clear, I mean over the category’s history, over the last 20 years, it’s grown 15% on a compounded basis. So, it just hasn’t been in a straight line. And this time around, it definitely wasn’t in a straight line because of the field inventory challenge that we have had as a persistent headwind this year. It’s getting better, but it’s really lasted the full year. So, I mean I am confident longer term, the category is going to continue to grow. It is still by far the most cost-effective way to deal with the power outage. And outages are – you look at the long-term baseline average. And these are numbers that are readily available from third-party collectors government data, FERC and NERC and others who focus on reliability, the statistics don’t lie. I mean power outages are on the rise, and they are lasting longer. We hear it from customers who are frustrated. There is another outage in Michigan today. Michigan has just been hammered by outages, and that’s one of the reasons why it’s a really good market for us penetration-wise. I mean pen rates in Michigan are over 15%, which is 15% of all single-family homes over $150,000 in value have a home standby generator install, which is when you think about that for a second, you put that in context, and I think it tells you where the pen rate can go, right. I mean pen rate nationally is 5.75%. And we are at states like Michigan, which is a major state, it’s at 15%. So – and every 1% of pen rate is the $3 billion market opportunity. So, you start adding that up and the numbers get really big, really fast. And we are at 75% share there, maybe even a little better than that. And that’s something that I think from a focal area is obviously something we put a lot of effort against as we look forward. But in terms of just whether that’s going to happen next year or not in terms of normalized growth rate, there is a lot of factors that go into that. But longer term, it’s definitely a category that is going to continue to grow.
Kris Rosemann: Yes. We typically short-term guide without any major events. And as you know, those happen. So, that’s always a catalyst for growth over the longer term. So, that – those are obviously the drivers. And then all the megatrends around that we are talked about for a while that are driving the demand for the category higher, those are still intact.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Jordan Levy with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi all. Henry on for Jordan here. I was just wondering if you could dig a bit deeper into some of the different dynamics you are seeing between the U.S. and the international C&I segments in the business. And now some of the segments you are looking for 2024. Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So, it’s great question. Thanks. In the U.S., we have outsized market verticals, I would say, in telecom and the national rental channels as well, which I will roll up in that C&I. So, in the U.S., as we have said, national accounts, the national rental accounts have, last couple of quarters have cooled off. They were heavy buyers of equipment last year and even earlier this year, that’s cooled off as I think there is some broader slowdowns in just some of the C&I markets overall. I think owing to some of the higher interest rate environment that we are in today, new construction. If you look at the Architectural Billings Index, last month being or like a couple of weeks ago being quite a bit softer. I think you are starting to see that and feel that. Certainly, we are in the rental markets, as we said. And then the other large vertical for us is telecom which has also slowed down considerably here. The CapEx spend for the large telcos, I think has been reined in a bit just as they wait to see what the end markets look like for the wireless consumer. And I think you are going to see that on a long-term basis, both of those verticals are going to be growing long-term. They just in the short-term here pulled back. So, that’s a dynamic that differs from, I would say, the rest of the world. We do sell into telecom and we sell equipment rental companies as well. But in terms of just their outsized nature of the size of those verticals here in the U.S., they are bigger. Outside of – when you get outside the U.S., I would say one of the areas that – for C&I that we have seen great interest for our backup power has been in Europe with, I think some of the war with Russia, Ukraine and just the concerns around energy security in the C&I space that impacts businesses. It may have had concerned about power interruptions last winter. That’s abated a bit, I think in recent quarters, but we are heading into winter and that’s something that could pick back up, but we are watching that. But I would say that’s a unique consideration when you get outside the U.S. And then there are some markets that are – when we called them out this morning in the call in our prepared remarks, but there is a couple of markets that are growing in their importance. India being one of those where we are a leader in natural gas gen sets. We have a factory there and a business there. In India that’s been doing quite well. We continue to see demand in the Middle East for our products, which are – there is quite a bit of, I think around higher energy prices, I think the Middle East has continued to move forward in terms of their economies, and that’s reflected in our order rates from that part of the world. And so those – I think there are some specific areas, Australia is another area of market that we continue to see nice improvements in our growth rates. So, I think that kind of just some of the dynamics to give you a little flavor of that. I think the business outside the U.S. for us is highly concentrated in Europe, though. We don’t have as much exposure to Africa. We have some limited exposure to Asia. South America is a nice market for us and a growing market as well, but it’s relatively small relative to the size of Europe. But I think that’s probably the most color unless, York, I am missing anything there?
York Ragen: I think the IDCs have been hanging in domestic.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Our industrial distributors have been doing quite well here in the U.S. and gaining market share there.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with North Coast Research. Your line is now open. Keith, your line is now open. Moving on, next question is from Chip Moore with ROTH MKM. Your line is now open.
Chip Moore: Hey everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you hear me?
Kris Rosemann: Yes.
Chip Moore: Fantastic. I wanted to follow-up on some of the green shoots you talked about for consults and close rates as it relates to the current housing market. Just – I guess I am curious if you would expect to see any impacts from a slowdown there in the higher rate environment, or just maybe a situation where people might decide to stay in their houses longer and pull the trigger? Just curious what you are seeing there.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks Jeff. Yes, the – obviously, there is puts and takes, I think with that, with housing. First of all, it’s really less than 20% of our sales going to new housing. So, I would say with housing starts at those slow and as they slow, not as big of an impact on us. Most of what we do is to – is retrofitting existing housing with products. And then that gets to kind of the question of, for most people, how long do you stay in your house. And if housing turnover slows down because of the higher rate environment, does that mean that people are going to start to look at projects in their house and think about that, or is there some dampening of the enthusiasm around that even because of the higher cost of money for borrowing against your house or just the concerns, overall economic concerns that consumers might have. Those things have to play out yet. I would say that again, kind of consistent with our previous remarks on this, is that when outages happen, the one thing we do know is that homeowners generally have a list in their head of like things they want to do to their house. And a generator is probably on that list somewhere for most people, depending on how many outages they have had and how long outages have lasted. But when they get an outage, that category of product tends to move up on their list. And outages tend to trump some of the other macro things that you might see around housing or the consumer as the economy cycles. And we have seen this time and time again in our history in the business is if we get the outages, people will reprioritize their spending. Maybe they won’t hold off on that kitchen remodel or putting in a pool or doing a bath remodel or taken a family vacation even in some cases, they reallocate their consumer dollars, they are spending to other categories that they deem more important. And so as outages – and again, this is the underpinning all of this is you have to have a belief that power outages are going to be on the rise, and they are going to last longer. They are going to be happening more frequently and they are going to last longer. The data bears that out, everything else that we have been talking about here would indicate that, that is going to be the case for the next several decades, just as the grid goes through a transition. And as that happens, I think that even though we may run into some economic cycles here that could put pressure on the consumer. I think as long as the outages happen, we feel pretty good about where we are going to be.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Kris Rosemann.
Kris Rosemann: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings results with you in mid-February. Thank you again and goodbye.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2023 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Harris, SVP, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Mike Harris: Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today’s call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter net sales were in line with our prior expectations as stronger-than-expected C&I product shipments offset residential products, which were lower than expected as a result of a softer consumer spending environment that impacted shipments of home standby generators and shore products. This had an unfavorable mix effect on gross margins, resulting in slightly lower adjusted EBITDA margins than previously expected. Year-over-year, overall net sales decreased 23% to $1 billion, and core sales declined 26% during the quarter. Residential product sales decreased 44% as compared to a strong prior year quarter that benefited from significant excess backlog reduction for home standby generators. The current year quarter continued to be impacted by elevated levels of field inventory for home standby generators as well as a decline in clean energy product shipments year-over-year. Global C&I product sales increased approximately 24% to an all-time quarterly record with broad-based growth across nearly all regions and channels. Adjusted EBITDA margins were negatively affected by the significant unfavorable sales mix as well as reduced operating leverage driven by lower home standby shipments and continued investments for future growth. Importantly, continued favorable price cost dynamics have created a meaningful margin tailwind, providing a partial offset to the unfavorable sales mix. Second quarter home standby shipments grew at a strong sequential rate, but declined significantly on a year-over-year basis as the second quarter of 2022 included the reduction of excess backlog and we continue to meaningfully under-ship end market demand in the current quarter as we focused on further reducing field inventories of home standby generators. Baseline power outage activity in the U.S. was well above the long-term average, but meaningfully weighted toward the final weeks of the quarter. Home consultations or sales leads were roughly flat from the prior year period and increased sequentially off an unseasonably strong first quarter. Additionally, home consultations during the second quarter was still more than 4x higher than the second quarter of 2019, further supporting our view that consumer interest in the product category has achieved a new and higher baseline level. Our residential dealer account returned to sequential growth in the quarter, ending at approximately 8,700, an increase of 500 dealers from the prior year. We continue to invest in growing the installation capacity of our channel partners, and we are making good progress towards our initiatives to increase dealer count, train non-dealer contractors, streamline the installation process and raise home standby category awareness across trade groups. We believe these efforts are important to the longer-term growth trajectory of the product category as the mega trends that support the demand growth outlook remain firmly intact. Activations, which are a proxy for installs, improved sequentially over the first quarter, but declined from a strong comparable period in 2022 that included the benefit of a backlog of installations in certain regions during the prior year. Activations were also below our prior expectations for the quarter, primarily due to the weaker consumer spending environment for home improvement. But despite this relative softness, activations during the quarter were more than double second quarter 2019 levels. Close rates were flat sequentially and remained meaningfully higher than the comparable period of 2022, but underperformed our expectations as a result of the shift in consumer spending patterns. The number of home standby generators in field inventory further declined in the quarter, while days of field inventory relative to historical norms also decreased sequentially. However, with close rates and activations lower than expected in the quarter, the field inventory normalization process is now expected to extend further into the second half of the year. As a result, we expect the elevated field inventory levels to further impact home standby shipments in the second half relative to our prior expectations with the return to year-over-year growth in home standby shipments now anticipated in the fourth quarter. We believe the stronger outage environment in the final weeks of the second quarter and the resulting strength in IHC support this expected return to growth later in the year. Longer term, the mega trends that are driving awareness for backup power solutions are as compelling as ever. Homeowners and business owners are becoming increasingly sensitive to the growing frequency of power outages driven by extreme weather and grid operators are struggling to solve the growing supply demand imbalances that are a byproduct of the accelerated energy transition that is underway. Importantly, these are not short-term issues as the transition to the next-generation power grid will be an uneven process and is expected to take decades to complete. We believe our unparalleled suite of solutions is well positioned to solve many of the energy-related challenges that consumers and businesses will inevitably face. I now would like to provide some commentary on our chore products, which consists of a broad lineup of outdoor specialty power equipment used for property maintenance in large residential and light commercial applications. These products, which are increasingly shifting towards battery-powered solutions experienced significant growth in recent years as homeowners have been spending more time to money on property maintenance since 2020. However, shipments in the second quarter declined from the prior year and were below our prior expectations as higher channel inventories in the industry, unfavorable weather trends and shifting consumer spending patterns impacted demand for chore products. This weaker than previously expected demand environment is expected to persist in the second half of the year, also contributing to our lower outlook for residential product sales. Now moving to our residential energy technology products and solutions. Second quarter sales were in line with our prior expectations and grew at a strong rate sequentially as shipments of our power cell energy storage systems improved and ecobee sales hit an all-time record for the quarter. Ecobee drove strong sales growth over the prior year and continue to take share in the smart thermostat market by strong positioning with professional contractors and new placement with key retailers. The ecobee team is progressing towards the launch of a smart doorbell camera in the second half of this year, which will provide for increased homeowner engagement with our home energy management platform. As the central hub of our home energy ecosystem, we firmly believe that ecobee’s feature-rich devices and significant expertise and user experience will provide to be – will prove to be key differentiators for Generac’s residential energy technology efforts. Although we are making progress in our future product roadmaps and building the confidence – and rebuilding the confidence of solar installers, the broad residential solar and storage market in the U.S. is showing signs of slowing. As a result, we now expect our suite of residential energy technology products and solutions to deliver gross sales at the low end of our previous range between $300 million and $350 million for the full year 2023 as weaker solar and storage industry demand dynamics are expected to persist throughout the balance of the year. To better compete in these large and growing market opportunities, we are continuing to invest heavily in the world-class talent and R&D infrastructure that is required to achieve next level quality while developing and commercializing innovative solutions. We believe our competitive advantages when we built around the combination of these ongoing investments, differentiated monitoring and management capabilities and a unique and seamless user experience. Combined with our core competencies around sales and marketing, lead generation, distribution, customer support and global sourcing. I’d now like to provide commentary on our C&I products, which once again outperformed our expectations. Global C&I product sales grew 24% over the prior year to an all-time quarterly record as multiple mega trends continue to support demand for backup power and mobile products around the world. Domestic C&I product sales grew at a robust rate in the second quarter, highlighted by strengthened shipments to a number of key customers for beyond standby applications, industrial distributors and national rental equipment companies. Shipments of natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects continued to see tremendous growth during the second quarter. We believe we are in the very early innings of this exciting new market opportunity as grid stability concerns and volatile energy markets are expected to further drive demand for these solutions. Leveraging our position as the leading provider of natural gas generators we are building an increasingly comprehensive solution set to enable the deployment of our products in multi-asset applications, such as pairing our smart grid ready generators with our emerging C&I storage, connectivity, advanced controls and grid services solutions. Shipments of C&I generators through our North American distributor channel grew once again at a strong rate and channel backlog also increased sequentially during the quarter. Quoting activity for C&I products remains robust, highlighting the ongoing strength in demand for backup power in this important channel that serves a wide range of end markets. In addition, we experienced another quarter of robust growth against a strong prior year comparison with our national and independent rental equipment customers as they continue to refresh and expand their fleets. While order patterns from rental companies have moderated after several quarters of exceptional performance, this end market has substantial runway for growth, supported by the critical need for future infrastructure-related investments. As the leading provider of backup power to the North American telecom market, sales to national telecom customers increased slightly during the second quarter as compared to a strong prior year comparison. Although we continue to expect shipments and order trends for these products to be uneven during the second half of the year, we believe investment in telecom infrastructure remains a secular trend as global tower and network hub counts further expand and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications requires backup power for resiliency. Positive momentum also continued during the second quarter for our International segment as total sales increased 10% year-over-year with the combined impact of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency effects contributing approximately 4% to sales growth. Core total sales growth was driven by strength in nearly all regions as well as global sales of our controls and automation solutions from our Deep Sea and Motortech acquisitions. While energy security concerns in Europe have moderated from peak levels seen in prior quarters, we continue to see positive momentum in important long-term international growth markets, including India, the Middle East and Australia. As the global energy transition accelerates, demand for electricity around the world grows and the threat of increasingly severe and volatile weather persists, we believe that the demand we are seeing in these markets supports our view that the need for power resilience is a global issue. Accordingly, we are continuing to invest and build out our international product and distribution capabilities to serve these large and diverse growth opportunities. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are raising our full year sales growth guidance for global C&I products to mid-teens range from prior expectations for a mid-to-high single-digit increase. In addition to the strong second quarter performance, the increased guidance is being primarily driven by continued strong backlog and operational execution for our domestic C&I products. In closing this morning, our C&I product category has continued to perform extremely well as our global teams have driven strong execution. But a softer than previously expected consumer environment impacted second quarter results and is the main driver in the reduction in our second half outlook for residential products. We view the headwinds in our residential product categories as temporary and we remain confident in the robust, longer-term outlook for our broad portfolio of backup power products and energy technology solutions. This confidence combined with our history of strong cash flow generation and healthy financial profile allows us to maintain a long-term focus on executing our powering a smarter world enterprise strategy. We will continue to make the necessary investments to capitalize on the megatrends that drive the future growth opportunities inherent in this strategy. We look forward to providing a more detailed update on our longer-term strategic vision at our upcoming Investor Day in late September. I will now turn the call over to York to provide further details on second quarter results as well as the outlook for 2023. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at second quarter 2023 results in more detail, overall, net sales decreased 23% to $1 billion during the second quarter of 2023 as compared to $1.29 billion in the prior year second quarter. The combination of contributions from recent acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency and approximately 3% net favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the second quarter by product class, residential product sales declined 44% to $499 million as compared to $896 million in the prior year. As Aaron discussed in detail, lower shipments of home standby generators, power cell energy storage systems and shore products drove this decline in residential product sales. In particular, for home standby, the year-over-year declines were due to a tough prior comparison where we were working down excess backlog, combined with the current year that is impacted by field inventory destocking. Commercial and industrial product sales for the second quarter of 2023 increased 24% to $384 million as compared to $309 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from recent acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% revenue growth in the quarter. This very strong core sales growth was driven by broad-based growth across nearly all regions and channels, highlighted by an increase in domestic shipments to direct customers for beyond standby applications, industrial distributors and the national rental equipment channel. In addition, international shipments of C&I power generation products and controls and automation solutions also contributed to this growth. Net sales for other products and services increased 37% to $117 million as compared to $86 million in the second quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of electronic environments given their additional service capabilities. We called out that this acquisition closed last year on June 30. Gross profit margin was 32.8% compared to 35.4% in the prior year second quarter due to the significant impact of unfavorable sales mix given the sharp decline in home standby mix compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by previously implemented pricing actions and lower input costs from improved commodities, logistics and plant efficiencies that are providing an important tailwind to margin trends that are expected to continue in the second half of 2023. Operating expenses increased $2 million or 1% as compared to the second quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased employee costs to drive and support future growth, higher marketing and promotion spend and the impact of recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions. This was mostly offset by lower variable operating expenses on the lower sales volumes. Adjusted EBITDA, before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $137 million or 13.6% of net sales in the second quarter as compared to the $271 million or 21% of net sales in the prior year. This lower EBITDA percent was primarily driven by the higher operating expenses as a percent of sales, given the lower sales volumes compared to prior year and to a lesser extent, the lower gross margins. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 28% to $815 million in the quarter as compared to $1.13 billion in the prior year, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 3% revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $103 million, representing 12.7% of total sales as compared to $242 million in the prior year or 21.5% of total sales. The lower domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily driven by the significant impact of unfavorable sales mix and reduced operating leverage on the lower shipments. The impact of acquisitions and continued investments in future growth also negatively affected margins during the quarter. These margin headwinds were partially offset by favorable price and cost benefits. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 10% to $224 million in the quarter as compared to $203 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 6% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interest was $33 million or 14.9% of net sales as compared to $30 million or 14.5% of net sales in the prior year. This stronger margin performance was primarily driven by favorable price and cost benefits. Now switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2023 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $45 million, as compared to $156 million for the second quarter of 2022. The current year net income includes approximately $15 million of additional interest expense compared to the prior year due to higher borrowings and interest rates. In addition, GAAP income taxes during the current year second quarter was $16 million or an effective tax rate of 25.9% as compared to $46 million or an effective tax rate of 22.5% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a lower benefit from equity compensation in the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.70 in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $2.21 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $68 million in the current year quarter or $1.08 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $185 million in the prior year or $2.86 per share. Cash flow from operations was $83 million as compared to $24 million in the prior year second quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release was $54 million as compared to $6 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in free cash flow was primarily due to significantly lower working capital investment in the current year quarter as inventory levels have stabilized, partially offset by lower operating earnings, higher interest payments and higher CapEx. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.62 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2.8x on an as-reported basis which is expected to moderate in the second half of the year as LTM EBITDA begins to increase. With that, I will now provide further comments on our outlook for 2023. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we are updating our outlook for the full year 2023. The softer than previously expected consumer spending environment for home improvement has impacted our outlook for residential products most notably for shipments of home standby generators. As a result of the software consumer, we are seeing lower close rates and activations relative to prior expectations which is causing higher field inventories and lower distributor sentiment compared to our previous guidance commentary. As a result of these factors, we now expect residential product sales for the full year 2023 to decline in the mid-20% range compared to the prior year, which compares to our prior expectation for a decline in the high teens range. Partially offsetting this incremental weakness in residential products, we are raising our outlook for C&I product sales which are now expected to grow at a mid-teens rates during the year as compared to our prior guidance of a mid to high single-digit rate. Overall net sales for the full year are now expected to decline between minus 10% to minus 12% as compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 2% net favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This compares to the previous guidance range of a decline between minus 6% to minus 10%. From a quarterly pacing perspective, we now expect a slight year-over-year decline in overall net sales for the third quarter with the return to year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. This guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the remainder of the year that is in line with the long-term baseline average. And consistent with our historical of course, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year. Looking at our gross margin expectations for the full year 2023, we now anticipate approximately 100 basis points of gross margin improvement over 2022 levels. We still expect sequential quarterly improvements in gross margins in the third and fourth quarters with third quarter gross margins projected to be approximately 150 to 200 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023. The anticipated sequential improvement in gross margins in the second half is expected to be driven by improved sales mix with higher shipments of home standby generators, lower input costs and the realization of cost reduction initiatives as compared to the first half of the year. Given the significant megatrends that support our long-term growth opportunities, we remain focused on driving innovation, executing our strategic initiatives, and investing for the future. As a result of these ongoing investments, we expect operating expenses as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 20% to 21% for the full year 2023. Given these gross margin and operating expense expectations, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are now expected to be approximately 15.5% to 16.5% for the full year 2023 compared to the previous guidance range of 17% to 18%. From a quarterly pacing perspective, we still expect adjusted EBITDA margins to improve throughout the remainder of the year, primarily driven by sequentially improving gross margins as previously discussed, and to a lesser extent, improved leverage of operating expenses on an expected higher sales volumes. Accordingly, we now expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA margins to be approximately 300 to 350 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023. And exit EBITDA margins for the fourth quarter of 2023 are expected to be in the low 20% range. Additionally, as Aaron discussed, we continue to make significant operating expense investments in our residential energy technology products and solutions to capitalize on the significant opportunities presented by the rapidly growing solar storage and energy management markets. As a result, we currently expect these investments to unfavorably impact our EBITDA margins by approximately 400 basis points for the full year 2023. We continue to expect operating and free cash flow generation to follow historical seasonality of being disproportionately weighted towards the second half of the year in 2023. For the full year, we expect adjusted net income to free cash flow conversion to be strong well over 100% as working capital moderates off of peak levels. We’re also providing updated guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2023. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, add-back items should be reflected net of tax using the expected effective tax rate. For 2023, our GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 25% as compared to the 19.6% full year GAAP tax rate for 2022. The year-over-year increases driven primarily by expectations for lower share-based compensation deductions, increased mix of income in higher tax jurisdictions, higher tax on foreign income in 2023 compared to 2022. Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $92 million compared to the prior guidance of approximately $90 million, assuming no additional term loan principal prepayments during the year and current expectations for SOFR rates throughout 2023. Interest expenses is expected to moderate in the third and fourth quarters as cash flows on our interest rate swaps become more favorable and as we expect to pay down a portion of our outstanding revolver indebtedness. Our capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately 3% of our forecast and net sales for the year. Depreciation expenses now forecast to be approximately $62 million compared to the previous guidance of approximately $60 million in 2023. GAAP intangible amortization expenses now expected to be approximately $102 million during the year as compared to the previous guidance of approximately $100 million. Stock compensation expense is still expected to be between $40 million to $43 million for the year. And our full year weighted average diluted share count is still expected to approach 63 million shares as compared to 64.7 million shares in 2022, which reflects the share repurchases that were completed in 2022. Finally, this 2023 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. As a reminder, we have $278 million of authorization remaining on our current share repurchase program. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we’d like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.
Tommy Moll: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Tommy.
Tommy Moll: Aaron, I wanted to start on the topic of channel inventory for the home standby product category. Last quarter, I think you were at about 1.5 times normal. Where do you sit now and am I hearing you correctly that embedded in your outlook is that that converges to the normal level by fourth quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Tommy, it’s – I mean, that’s obviously the central question here and has been a topic as we’ve discussed over the last several quarters. You’re right, we said, I think somewhere in the 1.4 to 1.5 times range is where we were last time we talked in April. Today, we believe that number is closer to 1.2 to 1.3 times as we exit – as we exited the first half. And with the assumption of a softer consumer spending environment in particular around kind of residential investment, these types of projects, home improvement projects, we’re really looking at a more moderated close rate. It’s interesting because we actually are seeing a lot of inbound activity in terms of sales leads. They’re just not – the close rate on those leads is not growing at the rate that we thought it would, and that’s really the kind of the – and then it just becomes a maths [ph] problem from there. We’re just not going to drain the inventory as quickly because we’re not going to convert those leads to activations at the rate that we thought we would here in the second half and that is – that’s going to create basically a situation where that elevated field inventory is going to persist a bit longer than we had originally thought. So through – really kind of through the year here, it’ll start to taper off and there’s definitely and I think you’ve done this with channel checks, we do our own channel checks and we know what field inventory looks like really with a high degree of accuracy region to region and dealer to dealer, wholesaler to wholesaler, retailer to retailer. And so we see regions where actually there isn’t a field inventory issue anymore. And we see other regions where field inventories are still higher than normal. So it’s become more of a mixed bag, if you will around the field inventory story. Whereas I would say you wind the clock back two or three quarters, it was – two or three quarters ago, it was everywhere. So the field was full of inventory in all regions. So now we’re starting to see some of that normalization be achieved in certain regions and in fact go beyond that. We’ve got a couple of regions you get up into Canada, in the Quebec markets where in particular where they’ve had a number of outages and we can’t get them enough product, they don’t have the installation bandwidth. So we get back to that issue and that’s obviously another area we’ve been focused on. So hopefully that gets the answer to your question
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Baird. Your line is now open.
Michael Halloran: Hey, morning everyone. So following-up a little bit on that…
York Ragen: I think we lost, Mike.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We lost Mike.
York Ragen: We lost, Mike.
Michael Halloran: [Indiscernible] The distribution channel’s growing too. Can you hear me or no?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Mike, we lost you there for a second. Can you repeat your question?
Michael Halloran: Yes, no problem. There’s a lot of moving pieces here from a channel perspective and in the home standby side, we kind of take along to that inventory question, but you’ve got high inventory. You’ve taken your outlook down a little bit slower consumer conversion, but the IHCs are higher, you’re gaining distribution inventory is at least normalizing a little bit. Can you help sync from a forward commentary how you think this demand curve starts playing out? Maybe just a little behind the hood on the sellout from a channel perspective, how you think those sequentials kind of work from a sellout perspective versus what normal might look like and just kind of any context to the – what the true underlying run rate might look like if you try to normalize for these moving pieces.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Mike. There are a lot of moving pieces, as you said, and when you think about the sell in versus sellout, again, we’re channel to channel, when we look at kind of the different metrics that we look at in every channel, we see some different things going on channel to channel. We do see our dealer channels, which are more turnkey project channels feel like they’re in and then the metrics bear this out that they’re in better shape than some of the other channels. So when we look at our wholesale channels and in particular our retail channels, retail would be is lagging for us right now. So when we look at – when we look through – at sell through at retail and we look at the – kind of the food traffic at retailers and I think you guys have those on the call here have heard some of the more recent commentary from some of the larger retailers. I think the food traffic has slowed and we are definitely seeing that in our residential product categories that we sell through retail. With maybe the notable exception being ecobee as we called out – in our prepared remarks this morning, which is interesting. And that really is probably more owed to higher energy prices and the opportunity to use those ecobee products to reduce your energy costs. But on the – the moving pieces that are in this and kind of thinking about the pacing, if that’s more your question, Mike, what we see here is as the kind of fog clears of this field inventory issue, we think that the dealers are kind of first to recover here, followed by – likely by wholesale. And then we’ve got a little bit further to go with retailers. The ones that are probably at the – when we talk about normalization at 1.2 to 1.3 times is across everything, right? So – and we sell kind of on an omnichannel basis, so dealers are better than that. Wholesalers are probably somewhere maybe a little worse than that and retailers are quite a bit worse than that at this stage. We do believe this will start to normalize here as we go throughout the third quarter. And as we get into the fourth quarter in particular, we should start to see that abate. The end market demand part of your question is interesting, because as we said, sales leads IHCs remain strong. In fact, they were even up sequentially from Q1 and they’ve – they’re just not converting quite at the same level. Now, what we’re not sure of at this point is if that conversion is just delayed or if that conversion is more the result primarily of the consumer just saying they’re not going to buy at all, right? Are they just not going to buy today or they’re not going to buy at all? And so as we continue to work on that, we’ve stood up an entire group here, we call it, our nurturing team for lack of a better terminology, but these are a team of dedicated salespeople that reach back out to unclosed leads. We’ve got quite a house file that we’ve built here of unclosed leads. The number of leads we’ve generated over the last several years is tremendous. And as you can imagine, a high percentage don’t close. So the opportunity to reengage with those homeowners at the right time with perhaps the right offer is growing. And we think that that represents an area of opportunity for us and one that we’re leaning into. But that’s something that – we’re still kind of in development phase on. I would tell you it’s not – we haven’t perfected it yet, but we’re doing a ton of work around that to see how we can continue to stimulate demand in particular around those customers that have already gone through the in-home consultation process. So I don’t know if I’m getting to the heart of your question or not, but we see end market demand as strong at least at this point. The awareness is strong. We need to see conversion improve to help us accelerate the clearing of the field inventory levels, but we are making good progress there. It’s just not as quickly as we had hoped.
York Ragen: Yes, I think the key is, seasonally – we do expect the home standby category to pick up in the second half of the year versus the first half, especially as inventory begins to normalize towards the – throughout the second half. I think it’s to Aaron’s point though, it’s just – maybe it’s not going to improve as much as we thought relative to three months ago, because of the software consumer that we’re seeing.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Your line is now open.
Jeff Hammond: Hey guys. Just back on this close rate dynamic, I’m just wondering if you’re getting feedback from your dealer network on kind of why the close rates are lower. Is it financing costs or the higher costs? Because I know you had been contemplating lead time or close rates getting better as lead times shortened. So that seems to be the big surprise and just looking for more feedback color.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Sure, Jeff. That is surprise to us as well. Although, as we look at – I would say kind of maybe comparable industries, where you’ve got bigger ticket types of home improvement projects, pools, patios, furniture, things of that nature. We’re maybe not seeing, I think you’re hearing commentary, but we’re all not seeing maybe the consumer step up to the same level that we all expected. And that I think is indicative of perhaps, just the work that the federal reserve is doing here to tamp down inflation with higher rates. I think it’s starting to bite in some of these areas in particular on these bigger ticket type of purchases. So that – for the home, anything tied to residential investment. I would tell you that, we did see, to get to the point that we’ve made in the past and that you’re making here, we thought that close rates previously had come down, because of the long lead times in the product, which we believed were kind of at the root of that. They bounced off the bottom kind of Q1 of 2022 and improved nicely sequentially up until this quarter. And this quarter, they kind of flattened out and where basically our guidance here contemplates that they don’t go up any further this year. That’s really the – that’s the change, right? We had – our previous guidance had contemplated that close rates would continue to improve, albeit not dramatically so, as we said on the last call, it’s going to take some time to return to those pre-COVID close rates. But the feedback from the channel around close rates is that homeowners are, they’re struggling to, again, with bigger ticket types of purchases and they’re just – they’re taking more time to think through that. And so we just think that that phase of the project, and again, I think the good news is we’ve got a sales lead, even if it didn’t close, we have the opportunity to re-engage with that customer and friction in the past, when we look at re-engagement, our close rates are better if we choose the right time to reengage, right, i.e., if another outage moves through a local market and our team engages with all those unclosed IHCs, those unclosed opportunities in that market, perhaps over the last 12, 24, even 36 months, we see a much higher close rate the second time around. So it’s kind of like the friction is lower because that process of the in-home sales consultation has already been – has already taken place. And so that just leads to an easier time to get to closure at least historically. So we’re going to – and that’s really where we’re putting a lot of our efforts here in the second half of this year is into that nurturing effort that I talked about before to really work on how do we get more unclosed IHCs to closure.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Mark Strouse: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Sorry to beat a dead horse here. I just want to ask on field inventory levels, again, a different way of looking at it, just how you’re thinking about what normal inventory levels are? The 1.2x to 1.3x that you’re talking about today, does your outlook kind of assume that that goes back to 1.0x? Or based on the channel checks that you mentioned earlier, is there a chance that that potentially goes even lower, at least temporarily, given kind of what you’re talking about with the macro? And then can I sneak up – sneak in a quick follow-up? Just to be clear, what I’m hearing, the margin issues are – at least the margin headwinds you’re talking about in guidance that is a mix issue. You’re not signaling any changing in pricing. Just want to make sure that that’s clear. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Mark, thanks for the question. So I’ll take the first part which is the field, again, just kind of expanding on the field inventory, we said 1.2x to 1.3x. Our assumption is that 1.0x is “normal”. I think the key question there is, is 1.0x the right number, right? And what is 1.0x based on? And so what it is, is we went back I think it was around 2019 levels for pre-COVID, if you will levels of field inventory just to kind of pick our point of normal, right? And that’s a debatable point. Could the channel decide that their normal is lower? Potentially. Recall though that in our world, the field inventory, there’s very – there’s not a ton of field inventory at the dealer level, especially when you get in the smaller dealers. They just don’t have the financial capacity or even the physical space to put product in. So in their world, maybe normal is zero. And that would be contemplated, of course, in the 1.0x. It’s going to be the other channel players the retailers, the wholesalers that are generally more stocking channels. And then our larger dealers that regionally will also stock product just to keep a constant flow to their teams in particular their install teams just to keep product moving. And so, if we do this on a days adjusted basis, though just to be clear, because there is seasonality to this. So as we think about this, the second half of the year is seasonally our stronger period for home standby generators. So we would see velocity typically pick up in the second half of the year. A year, when you look at it on a day’s basis, that field inventory calculation will adjust accordingly. And then in the first half of the year, in particular first quarter, which typically is our seasonally low period, that’s when you’d see kind of that days of field inventory adjust to reflect lower installation pace. But the key question is not lost on us in terms of what’s normal. Is there a risk there around the fact that maybe channel partners decide that normal is something less? Potentially. I don’t think it would be long-lived. It’d be probably short-lived if that’s the case. But we’re trying to be I think balanced in how we’re viewing this. And we think that that kind of 1.0x is a good reflection point of – is reflective of a good point in the curve in terms of what’s normal. And then on margin, York?
York Ragen: Yes, on the margin side, yes, in terms of the EBITDA percent guidance down. On the gross margin side, it’s all mixed. So there’s no pricing reduction assumptions in our guide, so it’s all mixed. And then when you get to OpEx, there’s a little bit of operating de-leverage on the lower sales. So that’s a smaller piece of the puzzle, but there’s no reduction in price in our guidance.
Operator: One moment for your next question. And the next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. I’m wondering if you could just – so margins are going to be at about 16% this year. Your targets for 2024 were in the mid-20s, and obviously a lot has changed since. But I’m wondering, is there an opportunity for margin expansion off of current levels? How would you bridge what’s reasonable to expect compared to that 24% to 25% margin target you laid out at the Analyst Day. York, I think you alluded to it in terms of 400 basis point of drag from the solar investments. But can you expand on that and what you folks view as a reasonable margin expectation in the medium-term?
York Ragen: Yes, yes, a couple things. I know I did mention in my prepared comments that Q4 – exit rate Q4 EBITDA margins are expected to be in that, that low 20% range. So we expect, obviously, things to pick up from here, especially as home standby shipments normalize. I guess, if you think about that previous Investor Day target for 2024, I know that our Energy Technology business things are just taking a little bit longer than maybe we originally laid out back in 2021 – September of 2021 for that business. This is more of a reset year for our Clean Energy business, and it’ll grow from here. So I think we’re going to level set what those, I guess, revised expectations are going to look like on September 27 when we have our Investor Day next month – September 27 next month. And I think we’ll be able to give clear updated targets for the long-term at that point. But I guess those are some data points that you can use for now.
Operator: One moment for your next question. Our next question comes for the line of Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Kashy Harrison: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. So just a few quick ones here. Can you just give us a sense of the revenue gap between sales into the channel and sales out of the channel? Are you underselling this year by $100 million, $200 million, $300 million? And then on the C&I side of the business just how do you think about the repeatability into 2024? Just giving some of these cross currents surrounding construction from the infrastructure bill maybe improved the ABI, maybe ladder ends of 5G. Just how do you think about the repeatability of C&I? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Kashy. So, yes, we haven’t disclosed the kind of gap between sell in and sell out. So but it – we are significantly under shipping the market here – market demand here in the first half as we work through that field inventory. And that really is the pull down and guidance here on the residential side as a result of that.
York Ragen: And we can see field inventory coming down in all of our data, so we know we’re under shipping the market.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We know we’re under shipping the market pretty dramatically at this point. So – and that’s why we think that we’re going to continue to grow here sequentially through the year because that field inventory drag will reduce as we get to the back half of the year. So again, haven’t put a fine number on it just kind of from a disclosure standpoint, but we definitely see that. And then on C&I, I think the question, it was a little broken up for us, sorry about that. But I think the question was just kind of about the sustainability of C&I and what we’re seeing there. I think as we said kind of in our remarks, obviously, we’re starting to come up against tougher comps, right? We’ve been – the C&I business has been very strong for a long time. It was another great quarter for our C&I business. Some of our national account customers, in particular, on the rental side, we’re starting to see some moderation of those order patterns here. But what we’ve heard from the – largely from our large rental customers is that utilization rates and equipment are still doing quite well. They’re holding in there. That said, I think proactively a couple of those larger customers have cut their CapEx guidance for the year. We’re pretty well locked and loaded for this year in terms of orders just in terms of our backlog. So we’re not expecting much to change there. The question will be 2024. Is that – does that roll over? Or does it – is there a significant change to that. We don’t have great visibility into that yet and wouldn’t be in a position to provide that guidance. On the telecom side, as we talked in the last call, and we mentioned in our prepared remarks this morning, our large national telecom customers, that demand tends to be – we’ve referred to it sometimes in the past is lumpy. I think we used the term on even this morning. But from quarter-to-quarter, it can accelerate and decelerate quite quickly, which would seem surprising, but I think because they – the way they manage projects and certain things can come and go in terms of their CapEx spending capabilities, it can be turned on very quickly and turned off very quickly. And so we’ve seen some of that kind of manifest itself here and was expected in the second half of the year. So nothing unexpected there, but I think the long-term setup when we talk to all the telecom customers is we’re in kind of a multiyear up cycle for telecom spending. We think just near term kind of unevenness in the way that CapEx is going to be deployed. But they have a lot of hardening to do with their networks here yet over the next several years. So we think that’s a run that’s going to be – it’s going to continue. And then I would tell you that within our core C&I products domestically and globally, in particular, where our products are now being deployed for what we refer to as beyond standby applications. So a generator could be used to be called upon at times of stress for the grid, right? So you’ve got very high temperature extremes or low temperature extremes or other points in the curve where the grid is under duress, the generator can be called into action by perhaps a local utility or grid operator and can – that power then can be flowed into the grid for support. And that is – those products are becoming much more popular. In fact, we’ve had a really good run there. We think we’re in the early innings of the use of these products. And really, what it is, is it allows customers who would otherwise be looking at a generator strictly from a – when you look at it from an economic standpoint, it’s about risk mitigation, either loss of revenue, loss of inventory, loss of process, something like that. You have to weigh that against the initial capital cost of the equipment and the ongoing maintenance of the equipment over its life. You can now essentially buy down that first piece cost, which has always been a barrier to ownership for the category by allowing for that product to be used in these beyond standby applications, and thereby monetizing that asset in a way that didn’t exist previously. So we think that as the grid continues to transition, that these assets that we’re formerly stranded basically, right? They were not connected to the grid necessarily only connected to – for emergency backup purposes for a property that they can be monetized in a way they couldn’t before. And that’s I think, an exciting opportunity for us, and we’re seeing more of that manifest itself here in the C&I markets.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
George Gianarikas: Hi good morning and thanks for taking my question. I think, I heard as part of your strategy to close – increased close rates, you did not contemplate price reductions across the residential portfolio. My question is, why not? Why isn’t that an option that’s on the table to help improve close rates, particularly in an environment where your input costs are going down? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks for the question, George. Actually, we do have – when we talk about price, you probably need to talk about net price, but the promotion dollars end up down in kind of operating expense in some cases. So – it’s not really just from an accounting – a technical accounting standpoint, it’s not always price. But we are using more promotion than we used maybe a year ago, certainly more than two years or three years ago.
York Ragen: And that’s included in our guidance.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And that is included in the guidance. So I think to maybe put a finer point on it, those teams that we’ve unleashed here on our unclosed IHC file continue to work on different types of promotional activities. We’re doing a lot of testing around what works, what doesn’t work. We’ve run some national promos. We ran one earlier this year, and we’ll have one on our schedule here at some point later this year. So that’s – those things are certainly included in the guidance. There’s a question, of course, do we need to do more? I think at this point, we believe we’ve got the right level in there to support the close rates that we’ve built into the most recent guidance. At some level, you just – you can’t promote perhaps to your way to a consumer that if the consumer is going to be stubborn and it’s going to be painful for them to spend because they’re concerned about, obviously, a lot of things around inflation around their employment status. I mean there’s so many things that go into that. that make up why and when a consumer feels confident to do that. Certainly, power outages and historically for us, softer consumer environments, we generally have been able to break away from when you get outages. And so that still exists here as an opportunity. Our guidance contemplates kind of a normal outage environment. And we have been experiencing kind of above normal outage activity here through – at least through the – late in the second quarter, we saw that tick up and actually July in and of itself has been somewhat active as well. So continue to watch that and see what impact that will have on close rates. But we do have a level of promotion in our guidance around trying to improve close rates for the balance of the year.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Donovan Schafer with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Donovan Schafer: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So I want to talk about chore and portables. So chore usually doesn’t get much attention, but this quarter, you guys actually called it out in a high level. Well, of course, some pack up, of course, that was the main driver. But do you think these smaller pieces can unfold in ways that kind of nudge things. I remember, I think, with the polar vortex in Texas. At the time, I think a lot of folks thought that’s great news, but you won’t be in that quarter, because you were supply constrained. You considering that manufacturing HSV, but you did end up beating and it came down to the portables, because you had that ready and so these can add up in ways that matter. So talking about chore products, the California ban on small sized gasoline engines under 25 horsepower that goes into the – into effect at the end of this year. I think old mowers and everything get grandfathered in. It’s not like if you own a gasoline lawnmower, you got to ditch it come January 1. But any new purchases, I believe need to be electric. So I’m curious, if – because it’s a smaller piece of the revenue mix, something like this has to almost like double or something to really become meaningful. And with portables when the polar vortex hit Texas, it’s kind of like what happened is you had this just massive surge in portables and getting shipped to that state. So in the case of something like this, I don’t think come January 1, you’re going to suddenly you get like a sudden doubling in chore products. But with Mean Green Mowers and the other clean energy chore products you have in this California lot going into effect, is that something where you see jumping to a 10%, 20% growth or a 2x, 3x over a number of years? Kind of a broader magnitude there. And then same thing on portables because you’ve launched a portable battery product a larger portable generator and a dual fuel generator, which those are all significant feature additions in those product categories. So anything on kind of the next year or so growth rate you would expect around those approximately?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Yes. Thanks, Donovan. So obviously, the regulatory environment continues to change, an outright ban on small engines in California, you’re spot on with that. California is pushing ahead with that. I think that like all kind of regulatory actions, sometimes there are unintended consequences of that, whether they be – maybe advanced purchases, maybe pull in of demand around that. We’re not seeing anything today for people who are loading up on, kind of internal combustion engine driven chore or generator products. Just to be clear, by the way, it’s – it would only impact this – the portable generators and chore products, home standby is not a part of that ban at this point. So just to be clear and you’re right, it’s a smaller part of our business. I mean, we did call out chore this time because frankly, they had a terrible second quarter and terrible first half. Very much in line with the residential portions of many of the other public companies that serve that market. I will say, it’s part of our strategy there that the strategy behind the Mean Green acquisition is those are electrified zero turn radius commercial mowing piece of equipment. And we have seen a dramatic rise in interest around those products but they’re expensive. And so conversion is more difficult. Now, the IRA that Inflation Reduction Act has provided for some subsidy for those products. And we have – we expect that will be clarified through treasury year over the back half of this year which will certainly help. We are the leader in that commercial segment when it comes to electrified commercial mowers. And that is going to be an exciting part of the business to watch. And we’re electrifying the rest of our chore products platform using the technology that we acquired with Mean Green as again, part of what we’re the brush cutting platforms and things that are so important to us there in chore products are being electrified as well. So we think we’ll be prepared as these bans take place. The one in California, certainly as you said, end of this year and we’ll have to see how it plays out. California also has on top of the federal subsidies, some state level subsidies for the purchase of those types of products to incentivize the switch from internal combustion engine driven products to electrified products. So we’ll continue to watch that portable generators different type of category, right? And this is where I think the unintended consequences of regulation, which if you have a multi-day outage, you’re just – you can’t buy a battery to get you through that, sorry, to California regulators. They’re not thinking that through. They should have left open products that are used for emergency use. And in their infinite wisdom, they probably will create waivers when they run into problems like they’ve done in the past for other areas of the market. They have these strict regulations and then they waive them when there are emergencies. And I wouldn’t be surprised to see the same happen here. There’s – generating power is different than storing power. That’s all there is to it. That said, we do have storage products, portable storage products that we’re introducing in the marketplace that are good for temporary short duration outages – outage protection but they also are expensive relative to the cost of internal combustion engine driven generators, which again, for emergency use, like those products are used primarily those that is the most cost effective way to serve the market. And unfortunately, those types of regulations only hurt the part of the market that it has less flexibility with their pocketbook and their checkbook around buying a product during an emergency. So that’s unfortunate and hopefully regulators will use their heads and clear heads of prevail there if emergencies do present as we believe will be the case long term here, as the grid in particular in California goes through a transition.
Operator: One moment for your next question. And your next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe I just wanted to get an update on the international market and I guess where do you stand on rollouts into countries like India? I guess, what are the competitive dynamics look like overseas and are you introducing a new HSB or new product, C&I product offerings for these regions? And then I guess finally when do you think we could see maybe an acceleration of revenue contributions in the international segment?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks for the question. So internationally, today, it’s mainly a C&I market for us. And internationally we’ve done very well. Our Pramac subsidiary very well respected brand, very well run company covers our geographies really outside the U.S. and Canada for us. And they, I mean, they’ve been on a tear and they continue to gain market share. The EBITDA margin profile of that company has improved dramatically over the course of our ownership here which I think spans now something on the order of eight years – eight, nine years, something like that. And so we continue to make really good progress there. And we’re actually getting quite a good benefit out of our global scale with C&I products here, even domestically. So the ability to consolidate purchases on engine platforms, some of the alternator platforms, and obviously the ability to use our Deep Sea controls across our global platforms and get the gain the benefit of scale there as well. That said, that market internationally, as I said, is primarily C&I, and it’s primarily diesel. So diesel powered generators are still at least outside the U.S. and Canada, the primary kind of legacy solution for emergency backup. And those products, in fact, I would say like in the U.S., natural gas backup power represents for C&I anyway, about 40% of the market here with about 60% diesel. Outside the U.S. and Canada, it’s more like 98% diesel, 2% gas. So the opportunity that exists is to introduce gas products, of which we’re the leader globally in, introduce those gas products into new regions and into the hands of new customers that we believe could benefit from connecting those products to natural gas pipelines as opposed to reliant on diesel refueling. There are benefits there far beyond just the continuity of fuel supply but also the emissions profile of those products and gas is tends to be cleaner than that of diesel, and so you see some real benefits there. You see customers who are now focused more on that. Regionally, we’ve really focused here, I would say in the last few years on India in particular, through an acquisition of a company called Captiva. Pramac acquired Captiva several years ago, and we continued to invest heavily in that market, and we’re seeing very nice growth albeit off of a small base, but very nice growth there. That’s an area that we’re going to continue to focus on. I think we mentioned Australia, another great opportunity for us. The Middle East has been a great market in terms of growth. On the home standby side, if you look at residential sales, we actually have an interesting level of HSB that we’re shipping into all parts of the world, which is really interesting. You see this in our activation data; we can see exactly where products are being installed and it’s just overshadowed by two things: one, by the size of the HSP business here in North America; but two, the growth rates of C&I internationally have just kind of been so good. You just, we haven’t talked a lot about the kind of growing HSB base that’s underneath all of that; but it is growing. We’ve introduced – we just introduced a product and HSB product in India, and that is getting some nice traction already. We’re continuing to introduce those products. Again, we’ve now got products that are compliant with very strict gas codes in Australia. And so we’re really kind of – when we say we’re the only kind of company that serves Australia, that’s true because the gas codes are very strict there. None of our competitors are able to meet the strict code requirements in Australia, and we see that as a wide open market and opportunities for good growth. And then the Latin American markets, which represent a, we believe a really good opportunity for us getting good penetration in places like Argentina, even places like Brazil, where we’re seeing the product really get – start to get the awareness levels start to increase. That’s really what we have to focus on. We’re kind of back to the early days of HSB back in North America, if you wind the clock back. So we got a lot of work to do, but we are seeing pockets of that. I don’t think it will be anything that will kind of contribute meaningfully to our international segment results here in the near-term. But longer term, we believe the gas product, gas C&I products and HSB products, we see higher growth rates for those products than we do for the traditional C&I products.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Stephen Gengaro: Thanks and good morning everybody.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning.
Stephen Gengaro: Thanks for taking the question. So just one for me, the – when we look at the inventory, the HSB inventories that that everybody’s been talking about. Is there any detail you can give us on sort of location of inventory relative to recent power outages?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean we haven’t – we haven’t talked about field inventories at that level of granularity. But I think I may have mentioned in my response to a previous question that we are seeing evidence where there are regions, certainly pockets locally where field inventories are at normal levels or frankly, are quite a bit below what we might say would be normal because of elevated activity. So Canada has been a really interesting market here as of late with a lot of outage activity. And we see field inventories in Canada quite low versus other areas of the country. We see some other areas of the country particularly like the Midwest, is another area. Michigan is just a state that continues to get pummeled by both summer weather and winter weather. And this is – the interesting thing is, I think there’s a misconception somehow that our best home standby markets are in Gulf Coast states or areas where you’re more prone to hurricanes. And that, of course those kinds of demand drivers, of course are important for the category, but actually where we see greatest kind of penetration rates and growth rates are in those states that have kind of two seasons of weather, both winter and summer have other kind of factors that play into an elevated level of outages, and Michigan is just one of those areas. I’d say it has a lot of outages caused by different extremities of weather, but also the grid is mainly above ground in Michigan. It’s older. It was built around the automotive industry, so it was built out over 100 years ago. It’s underinvested in, in a more significant way than in other areas because it’s much more fragmented. There are many more independent grid operators in the state of Michigan than you would imagine. And so the grid doesn’t kind of heal itself well when you do run it outages and there’s a lot of trees in Michigan. So trees are part of the equation with outages. So we put all of that together and some of the states that we see the best growth and the best penetration are in states like Michigan, states like Maine. We see Ohio, Pennsylvania, those types of areas are actually very strong in the context of our growth rate. So again, as you would expect, where we’re seeing stronger rates of growth those are the areas that are getting to normalization of field inventory quicker. And that’s – again, without providing more detail, that’s how I would give you some context around the question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Blake Keating with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Blake Keating: Hi. Good morning. This is Blake on for Brian. Just quickly, I wanted to ask about, you previously mentioned that your largest piece of customers and home standby are generally older and less affected by the macro environment. I’m just looking to get some additional color there. Are they actually impacted by the macro environment and just trying to understand what’s causing the slowdown and the consumer outlook for Home Standby?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks Blake. We have seen the demographic over time as the category has grown. The category used to skew much older when you kind of wind the clock back. And over time, as it’s broadened out, we have seen the average age of buyers come down, but it still indexes to an older demographic people who have – and home ownership tends to skew that direction as well. And yes, they may, in fact, be somewhat more resilient if you will, to changes in the economy, but I think nonetheless they also – inflation does impact people that are on a fixed income, perhaps even more. Like you can make an argument that perhaps a portion of that segment is maybe a little more vulnerable to certainly trends in inflation. We haven’t seen – yes I wouldn’t say like from this point last year to this year, we haven’t seen any major shift in the demographic underpinning kind of the buyers of the category at this point. We’ll continue to watch that as the – as time goes on here, certainly this year and into the future. But I think right now, what we’re just – what we’re seeing is that more broadly, the consumer spending environment around home improvement is softening, right? And I think that we’re getting a little bit caught up in that. And that’s what I think is impacting. Again, close rates aren’t dropping. I think that’s an important point here. They’re just not growing back to the levels that we saw pre-pandemic. We do think they’ll get back there eventually, but they’ve kind of flattened out here. So I think the challenge is that we thought they would continue to grow, and that’s the – perhaps the new piece of information this morning.
Operator: And one moment for your next question. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Housum: Good morning guys. I know we’re running long so us keeps the one question here. Just in terms of the Clean Energy solution set in the redesign of the product portfolio going into 2024. If you guys just provide an update on if you guys are up to date on that or on track? And then some of the challenges that, that segment is facing right now in terms of cropping demand.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks. It was – that category of product for us, well documented. We entered that market, had some struggles. We had a lot of growth. We had a lot of success early on, hit kind of our challenges with the loss of a major customer last Q3 and then some of the product quality challenges with the SnapRS device is really the product that we talked about here. We are going through our – we’re on a next-generation road map for our battery solutions. – our storage solutions. I’m very excited about that product. We’re going to talk more about that in our upcoming Investor Day. We’re going to talk about some of those products. We won’t be able to get too granular there because we don’t want to tip our hat maybe to some of our competitors in the market, but we have some really exciting things. We’ve been – as we said on the call kind of in the prepared remarks, we’re investing very heavily to 400 basis point drag on EBITDA margin right now, which is challenging, of course, especially as the residential business is going through a cycle here that becomes even more challenging to stomach. But we’re very excited about the future of those products. The market, in general, as you’re indicating, and as we’ve seen from other participants in the market is a tougher market right now than it has been. Again, higher interest rates being probably at the root cause of that and then maybe more recently, the NEM 3.0 decision in California specifically, those two things are weighing on kind of solar and storage, solar plus storage demand here and are reflected kind of in our updated guidance this morning, we have been targeting a $300 million to $350 million range for those – that portfolio of products for the year. We now are thinking we’re going to come in on the low end of that range. Primarily because of the softening dynamics, demand dynamics that are going on that we’re seeing in the industry. But we still are very optimistic long term, and that’s why we’re spending heavily against this opportunity. We think that we know that it’s going to take a different level of investment to become proficient and excellent in these products. We now know that after going through our experience. And we are dedicated to doing that. And we’re going to see those results. You should see some of those products, as we’ll talk in September, really going to start hitting in 2024, and we’re pretty excited about the future there without getting too specific.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vikram Bagri from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Vikram Bagri: Good morning everyone. When talking about margin improvement, you talked about better product mix, cost cuts and lower input costs and the absence of promotions to clear the inventory was not a driver. So it seems like you plan on continuing promotions given persistently high inventories and your target of improving the conversions. Can you, one sort of give us directionally what the impact of these promotions was on gross margins and operating margins, dollar terms or percentage terms? And then two, how long or what sort of the magnitude of promotions do you plan on running to achieve both those targets, improving the conversion rates and reducing [ph] the inventories?
York Ragen: This is York. Yes. No, the promotions that we’re talking about, again, we run promotion in the ordinary course when we’re not in backlog and just again to drive awareness of the category and help get homeowners over the tipping point to make – to go ahead and make the purchase of a home standby generator. So I wouldn’t say it’s – I would say it’s a modest impact to margins overall. Again, these are our highest margin products. So you sort of – as you sell more of these products, you mix you get a significant mix benefit, which sort of overshadow whatever promotion we may be offering. So I think that’s the key there. And what promotion we do have layered into the guidance is not a significant part of the story or a significant impact to our margins. I think when you think about the cadence of EBITDA margins over – from first half to second half, I think just mixing – getting a higher level of home standby shipments out the door, that will have a significant impact. The additional operating leverage on our fixed SG&A will have a big impact. And then we’re just going to continue to realize improved input costs as we sort of work through our inventory levels, and we’ll start seeing the realization of lower commodities and logistics costs and so – that’s really what’s going to drive the sequential improvement in EBITDA margins for first half, second half. And promotions will only have a slight drag relative to that performance.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Harris.
Mike Harris: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2023 earnings results with you in early November as well as providing an update on our longer-term strategic vision at our upcoming Investor Day on September 27. Thank you again, and goodbye.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-03 11:45:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mike Harris, Senior VP, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Mike Harris: Good morning. And welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements.  Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable US GAAP measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings.  I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter net sales adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were higher than expected, primarily due to continued strong shipments of our commercial and industrial products globally. Adjusted EBITDA margins were also better than expected due to favorable price cost dynamics. Additionally, field inventory levels of home standby generators declined at a rate consistent with our expectations in the quarter.  Year-over-year, overall net sales decreased 22% to $888 million, and core sales declined 24% during the quarter. Residential product sales decreased 46% as compared to a strong prior year quarter. That includes the benefit of significant excess backlog for home standby generators, and was also impacted by elevated levels of field inventory for home standby generators as well as a decline in clean energy products.  Global C&I product sales increased approximately 30% to an all-time quarterly record, with strength in most regions internationally, and all channels domestically. Adjusted EBITDA margin was negatively affected by significant unfavorable sales mix, and reduced operating leverage, driven by lower home standby shipments and continued energy technology growth investments. These margin headwinds were mostly offset by favorable price cost dynamics.  Now discussing our first quarter results in more detail, while home standby shipments declined significantly in the quarter leading indicators of demand for the category were exceptionally strong during the first quarter. Baseline power outage activity in the U.S. was well above the long-term average during the quarter, with several larger localized outages in multiple regions, marking the highest level of baseline power outage activity for our first quarter since we began tracking outages in 2010.  Home consultations or sales leads were up significantly over the prior year period with broad-based growth experienced in almost all states. Additionally, home consultations were approximately flat sequentially during the quarter, which is highly unusual for the seasonally softer first quarter, particularly as we're coming off of a record fourth quarter, and this strength continued in the month of April.  For historical perspective, first quarter home consultations were more than four times higher than the comparable period in 2019, supporting our belief that the home standby generator category has reached a new and higher baseline level of demand. Our residential dealer count was more than 8600 at the end of the quarter, an increase of over 500 dealers from the prior year. While this is a slight decline on a sequential basis due to seasonal headwinds, we expect our dealer count to grow significantly over the coming years as we continue to focus on expanding our installation bandwidth.  Activations, which are a proxy for installs were impacted by severe weather in multiple regions and declined slightly from the prior year period, which included a challenging comparison in the South Central region that saw notable strength in the prior year due to the backlog of activations related to the Texas deep freeze in 2021.  The number of home standby generators and field inventory continued to decline towards more normalized levels during the first quarter, with the number of units falling meaningfully and ending the quarter approximately in line with our prior expectations. Days of field inventory relative to historical norms also decreased sequentially in the quarter but remained elevated. We expect field inventory to decline further in the second quarter, resulting in another quarter of lower home standby orders and shipments relative to the higher end market demand. Before returning to more normalized levels as we enter the second half of the year.  Our initiative to increase home standby generator installation capacity remains a top priority for the company. We’ve recently launched our dealer talent network, which is showing early signs of momentum as we help our dealers find the talent needed to successfully grow their businesses. We also recently announced a partnership with the independent electrical contractor’s trade group, and this further elevating the Generac brand within the electrical contractor community and providing additional training resources in key markets, including Texas and Florida.  Additionally, we have identified a number of project management improvement opportunities that we believe can help dealers optimize overall project timelines, in addition to several product related enhancements, to further simplify the installation process. These initiatives are not only focused on solving near term installation capacity challenges, but are also designed to provide sustainable solutions for tighter skilled labor markets.  We believe these solutions as well as continuing to expand overall distribution could further increase Generac’s competitive advantage given our unparalleled scale, focus and expertise in the home standby market. Consistent with the comments provided on our fourth quarter earnings call in mid-February, we expected the first quarter mark the trough for home standby shipments in the current channel destocking process. We continue to anticipate a return to year-over-year sales growth in the second half of the year, as field inventory returns to more normalized levels. The above average outage environment and robust growth in home consultations thus far in 2023, further support this expectation.  The range of threats that utilities and grid operators face was on full display in recent quarters, as the outage environment has been driven by severe weather, power supply shortfalls and unanticipated spikes in demand. Outage events are no longer limited to one off major storms. And as reliance on electricity continues to grow, consumers and businesses have demonstrated that they are less willing to accept the deteriorating level of power liability, and they're taking actions to improve their own resiliency.  I'd now like provide some commentary on our residential energy technology products and solutions. While we're facing temporary headwinds for our residential clean energy offerings, our commitment to success in these markets has not changed. This strategically important area of our business gives us access to a number of highly attractive market opportunities that are supported by strong end demand and further reinforced by unprecedented levels of policy support. We expect this to combined serve the addressable market for residential solar MLPEs, storage, EV charging, home energy monitoring and management and grid services will grow at strong double digit CAGR through 2026, resulting in a domestic market opportunity of more than $10 billion.  During the first quarter, shipments of power cell energy storage systems remained under pressure as we continue to rebuild and add to our distribution for these products, following the loss of a large customer that cease operations in the third quarter of last year. Additionally, we continue to make good progress on our SnapRS upgrade campaign in the quarter. And we remain committed to taking care of our customers and the channel partners that are participating in this program.  In addition to our residential storage efforts, our energy monitoring and management capabilities remain well positioned as positive momentum and ecobee’s device sales, together with a number of product awards, that resulting in continued market share gains. And highlight the consumer appeal of our feature rich smart thermostat offerings.  Ecobee’s already strong customer satisfaction scores have improved further since the 2022 release of our latest generation devices, validating ecobee’s expertise and user interface and user experience development. We're heavily leveraging that expertise in our single pane of glass initiative, which will act as the central hub of our residential energy ecosystem.  It's also worth noting that customer interest in our grid services offerings remain strong with another quarter of robust sales growth off of a low prior year base. We’ve recently announced a strategic minority investment enrolling energy resources and EV load management software provider as part of our effort to be the leading solution to EV load management to utilities and consumers. We believe this innovative area of our business will help facilitate the transition to the next generation grid. And ongoing policy support remains a potential tailwind as regulators and policymakers increasingly recognize the value of flexible digital solutions to the challenges facing on evolving power grid.  We continue to expect gross sales from residential energy technology products and services to deliver between $300 million and $350 million for the full year 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to be elevated in 2023, as we continue to build a home energy technology foundation for growth, to position our combination of hardware and software solutions for long term success.  With new leadership running this part of our business, our teams are focused on more deeply integrating the product and platform we've acquired over the past four years with an eye towards tightening our focus on the solutions, where we believe we can create the most value for the consumer as part of the residential energy ecosystem.  With improved focus and execution, and by leveraging our core competencies around sales and marketing, lead generation distribution, customer support, and global sourcing and logistics, we believe we can create competitive advantages with our residential energy technology products and services that will become evident over time as we continue to develop the Smart Energy home in the future.  Switching gears and I want to provide some commentary on our C&I products, which have experienced significant growth over the last few years, and once again outperformed our expectations in the quarter. Global C&I product sales grew 30% over the prior year to an all-time quarterly record. And backlog for these products also remained at record levels at the end of the quarter, as multiple megatrends support demand for backup power and mobile products around the world.  Shipments for domestic C&I products grew in the first quarter highlighted by strength across all channels, including national rental equipment, industrial distributors, telecom and other direct customers for beyond standby applications. Shipments of C&I generators to our North American distributor channel grew significantly again in the first quarter. An order trends and channel backlog also increased at a strong rate.  Quoting activity remains robust and close rates improve nicely on a year-over-year basis, highlighting our sustained market share gains and the ongoing strength and demand for backup power in this important channel. As a leading provider of backup power to the North American telecom market, shipments to national telecom customers also increased at a robust rate during the first quarter as compared to the prior to strong prior year comparison, as several of our larger national customers continue to deploy generators to harden their existing sites and build out their fifth generation 5g networks.  While shipment in order patterns for certain customers in this channel are expected to be lumpy in the second half of the year, investment in telecom infrastructure remains a secular trend as global tower and network hub counts further expand, and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications requires backup power for resiliency.  We also experienced another quarter of tremendous growth for our national and independent rental equipment customers, as they continue to refresh and expand their fleets. This end market is supported by the secular trend of critical need for significant infrastructure investments that will require years to complete. And mobile power products and light towers will be necessary in these essential construction projects.  Natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects also continue to see increased traction during the first quarter as shipments of these products once again grew at an exceptional rate. We believe we are in the very early innings of growth for this exciting new market opportunity as grid stability concerns and volatile energy markets are expected to further drive demand from these solutions.  Additionally, the business models of our direct customers in this vertical are innovating the generator marketplace, by developing as-a-service offerings which dramatically reduces the need for the large initial capital outlays that have traditionally been required for businesses to add resiliency to their operations.  Internationally, robust momentum continued as shipments increased 17% year over year during the first quarter, with 19% core sales growth when excluding the net impact of contributions from acquisitions, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Core total sales growth was driven by strength across key regions, most notably in Europe, where power security for homes and businesses remains a top priority amid ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty.  International segment EBITDA margins also increased meaningfully during the quarter, primarily due to favorable price cost dynamics, and improved operating leverage on higher sales volumes. Supplementing our international performance, we're also beginning to see long-term growth potential emerge in new and developing regions, such as India, where we're experiencing positive sales momentum for our backup power solutions. This rapidly growing market has unique characteristics for a developing country with the size of its population, broad electrical infrastructure coverage, and an increasing number of homes and businesses with direct natural gas connections.  We are currently building out our full range of residential and C&I gas solutions to address this large market opportunity. Additionally, during the quarter, we acquired the remaining 20% minority ownership interest in Pramac, bringing our total ownership to 100%. Pramac is a leading designer and manufacturer of stationary mobile and portable generators, along with energy storage solutions sold through a broad distribution network across the world. And it has been a key driver of our successful international expansion, since we first acquired a majority interest in the company in early 2016.  Through the combination of focused investment, and Pramac global presence, this has become an important strategic element of our international growth aspirations.  As we've been experiencing on the residential side of our business, our global C&I product category is similarly in the very early innings of its own energy technology evolution, and we've made meaningful parts progress towards that evolution here in 2023. In addition to our advanced controls and connectivity solutions, beyond standby natural gas generators and mobile energy storage systems, we've now added stationary energy storage solutions for behind the meter applications, both domestically and internationally to our product portfolio.  In February, we acquired REFU Storage Systems, a German based developer and supplier of energy storage hardware products, advanced software, and platform services for international, commercial, and industrial customers. We also recently announced our new series of Generac branded stationary energy storage systems for the North American C&I market, in partnership with a leading supplier of behind the meter storage solutions.  These developments represent our initial foray into this rapidly growing market, and advancing our C&I storage capabilities will remain a key initiative for Generac in the coming years. The long-term opportunity for energy technology solutions within our C&I product categories is extremely robust. And I'm confident in our ability to leverage our existing positions of strength around the world to compete in these markets.  In closing this morning, we believe our first quarter performance represents a trough in the current cycle, as we continue to focus on reducing home standby fuel inventory levels. And as we work to rebuild sales momentum for our power sell residential energy storage systems. That said, we're extremely pleased with the continued execution in our global C&I product categories that drove overall results ahead of our prior expectations. And we're encouraged by the progress we're making in addressing the near term challenges that are impacting our residential product categories.  In addition, the robust level of power outage activity and resulting strength in home consultations for home standby generators so far here in 2023, provides incremental support for our expectations to return to year over year sales growth in the residential product category in the second half of the year.  Importantly, we're maintaining our full year net sales and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance, as we execute on our near term initiatives, and position Generac for sustained long-term success in our mission to lead the evolution to more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions.  I'd now like to turn the call over to York, to provide additional details on first quarter results, and discuss our outlook for 2023. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at first quarter 2023 results in more detail. Net sales decreased 22% to $888 million during the first quarter of 2023, as compared to $1.14 billion in the prior year first quarter. The combination of contributions from recent acquisitions, and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 2% net favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter.  Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the first quarter by product class, residential product sales declined 46% to $490 million as compared to $777 million in the prior year. As Aaron discuss in detail, lower shipments of home standby generators and power cell energy storage systems growth this decline in residential product sales.  Commercial and industrial product sales for the first quarter of 2023 increased 30% to $363 million as compared to $279 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from recent acquisitions were nearly fully offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency during the quarter. The very strong core sales growth was broad based across most regions internationally, and all channels domestically, with particular strengths in domestic national rental equipment, industrial distributors, telecom and other direct customers for beyond standby applications.  Net sales for other products and services increased 32% to $106 million as compared to $80 million in the first quarter of 2022. The acquisition of electronic environments contributed approximately 28% of this growth given their additional service capabilities. Core sales growth for the category was approximately 4% primarily due to growth in our energy technology service offerings, along with continued growth and aftermarket service parts and extended warranty revenue recognition.  Gross profit margin was 30.7% compared to 31.8% in the prior year first quarter, due to the significant impact of unfavorable sales mix, given a sharp decline in home standby mix compared to prior year. This is mostly offset by realization of previously implemented pricing actions together with lower input costs from improved commodities, logistics, plant efficiency and other cost reduction efforts.  Operating expenses increased $22 million or 11% as compared to the first quarter of 2022. This increase is primarily driven by higher marketing, promotion and employee costs, certain legal and regulatory expenses and the impact of recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interest as defined in our earnings release was $100 million, or 11.3% of net sales in the first quarter as compared to $196 million and 16.3% of net sales in the prior year. The lower EBITDA percent was primarily driven by the higher operating expenses as a percent of sales, given the lower sales compared to the prior year. I'll briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment, sales decreased 26% to $720 million in the quarter, as compared to $975 million in the prior year. With the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 3% revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $68 million, representing a 9.4% margin as compared to $170 million in the prior year 17.5% of total sales. The lower domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix and reduce operating leverage on lower shipments. In addition, the impact of acquisitions, and continued energy technology growth investments negatively affected margins during the quarter. These factors were partially offset by the realization of previously implemented pricing actions and lower input costs. International segments total sales including intersegment sales increased 17% to $216 million in the quarter, as compared to $185 million the prior year quarter. Core sales which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 19% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interest is $32 million, or 15% of net sales, as compared to $26 million, or 14% of sales in the prior year. This margin increase was driven primarily by favorable price cost dynamics and improved operating leverage and higher volumes. Now switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2023 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $12 million, compared to $114 million for the first quarter of 2022. The current year net income includes approximately $13 million of additional interest expense in the prior year due to higher borrowings and interest rates. GAAP income taxes during the current year first quarter were $8 million or an effective tax rate of 35.7% as compared to $29 million or an effective tax rate of 19.7% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a lower benefit from equity compensation on a lower pretax earnings base in the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.05 for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $1.57 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release was $39 million in the current year quarter, or $0.63 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $128 million in the prior year or $1.98 per share. Cash flow used in operations was negative $19 million as compared to negative $10 million in the prior year first quarter. And free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was negative $42 million as compared to negative $37 million in the same quarter last year. The modest decline of free cash flow was primarily due to lower operating earnings and a $36 million one-time cash tax payment for tax planning related to a recent acquisition. This was mostly offset by lower working capital investment in the current year quarter as we reduced our material receipts and production rates for residential products and stabilized inventory levels.  Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.61 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2.25 times on an as reported basis. Outstanding debt increased $179 million during the current year quarter, as we use proceeds from those borrowings to fund the $105 million Freddie Mac buyout, the $36 million one-time cash tax payment for tax planning purposes, and a $60 million REFU Storage acquisition. With that I will now provide further comments on our outlook for 2023. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we're maintaining our prior outlook for the full year 2023. We continue to expect the residential product category will be impacted by higher home standby field inventory levels in the second quarter, before returning to year-over-year sales growth in the second half of the year, resulting in a full year decline in the high teens range compared to the prior year. Our outlook for C&I product sales to grow at a mid to high single digit rate during the year remains unchanged as we come up against increasingly challenging prior year comparisons in the second half of the year. As a result, we continue to expect overall net sales for the full year to decline between minus 6% to minus 10% as compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 1% to 2% favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the remainder of the year. That is in line with the longer term baseline average. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year. Additionally, this outlook does not assume a prolonged, deep recessionary environment that meaningfully impacts consumer spending during 2023. Having said that, demand for our home standby products tend to be driven more by power outages, rather than overall macroeconomic conditions. We continue to expect sales to be more weighted to the back half of the year as field inventory normalizes and consistent with normal seasonality excluding excess backlog. With overall net sales in the first half now being approximately 45% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 55% weighted. Our gross margin expectations for the full year 2023 are also unchanged, as we anticipate approximately 150 basis points of gross margin improvement over 2022 levels. For the seasonality perspective, we continue to expect our first quarter gross margins will mark a low point for the year. We anticipate sequential quarterly improvements resulting from improved sales mix, with higher shipments of home standby generators, along with lower input costs, improved overhead absorption, and realization of cost reduction initiatives as we move throughout the year. Gross margins are expected to progressively improve throughout the year, with second half of 2023 gross margins to be approximately 500 basis points higher than first half 2023 margins. The continued strength our end markets gives us the confidence to continue to focus heavily on supporting innovation, executing on strategic initiatives and investing for future growth. As a result of these continued investments, we expect operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding intangible amortization expense to be approximately 20% for the full year 2023 with operating leverage improving throughout the year. Given these gross margin and operating expense expectations, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interest, are still expected to be approximately 17% to 18% for the full year. From a seasonality perspective, we expected adjusted EBITDA margins to improve significantly throughout the year, primarily driven by sequentially improving gross margin that was previously discussed, and to a lesser extent improve leverage of operating expenses on the expected higher sales volumes in the second half of 2023. Accordingly, we continue to expect second half adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 800 basis points higher than first half margins. We're also providing updated guidance detail consist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for full year 2023. For 2023, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25% as compared to our previous guidance of 24% to 25%. And the 19.6% full year GAAP tax rate for 2022. The year-over-year increase is driven primarily by expectations for lower share based compensation deductions, increased mix of high income and higher tax jurisdictions, and higher tax and foreign income in 2023 compared to 2022. Interest expense is still expected to be approximately $90 million, assuming no additional term loan principal prepayments during the year. And assuming elevated SOFR rates throughout 2023. Interest expense is expected to moderate in the back half of the year, as cash flows and our interest rate swaps become more favorable, and we pay down a portion of our outstanding revolver indebtedness. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. Depreciation expense is now forecast to be a proxy $60 million compared to the previous guidance of $56 million to $58 million in 2023, due to the addition of REFU storage related depreciation expense. Gap, intangible amortization expense expectations are unchanged at approximately $100 million during the year. Importantly, to arrive at appropriate estimates were adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, this add back items should be reflected net effects using the expected 25% tax rate. Stock compensation expense is still expected to be between $40 million to $43 million for the year. Operating and free cash flow generation is expected to follow historical seasonality are being disproportionately weighted towards the second half of the year in 2023. For the full year, we expect adjusted net income to free cash flow conversion will be strong at well over 100% of working capital levels moderate off peak levels. Our full year weighted average diluted share count is still expected to decrease to approximately 63 million shares, as compared to 64.7million shares in 2022, which reflects the share repurchases that were completed in 2022. Finally, this 2023 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question will come from Tommy Moll Stephens Inc. Your line is open. 
Tommy Moll: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Aaron, it's good to hear some of the constructive updates on IHCs in the period. And on a related topic, I wanted to talk about the close rates there. Can you update us on what those looks like? Maybe compared to the prior year or pre pandemic? And as you progress through the year, do you see it landing somewhere in the range of a pre-pandemic kind of level? Or is there something structurally different here? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, thanks. Thanks, Tommy. We actually, were very encouraged by the sales lead volume that we saw -- as we said, in Q1, it was, in fact, it would have been a record Q1, if not for the copying, the last record Q1 was 2021, when we had Texas, the deep freeze, so if you take that out, Q1 would have been a record for consultations. Just for the baseline. Yeah. So I mean, it was it was pretty robust. And in fact, that carried through here in April as well. Close rates, interestingly enough, like, we've talked about this previous call. So we're still well off our pre pandemic, close rates, but those they have been recovering, they kind of bottomed beginning of last year, so about a year ago. So from a cost perspective, we're up nicely off those close rates from a year ago. As far as do we think will recover to pre pandemic levels by the end of this year, we've still got a ways to go, we continue to see progress. And we think that, a big part of that story, as we've mentioned previously, is just getting the lead times back down, which clearly isn't an issue anymore. So, the thing we'll watch, of course, with close rates is there’s a softening economy, potentially in the back half of the year, how does that impact close rates? You know, we are seeing as just as a side note there, we're seeing continued uptake in our financing options for homeowners. In fact, we had incredible growth on our financing program in Q1. And that's in spite of, you know, the residential category being down 46% financing was up dramatically in the quarter.  So we do know that there are consumers out there that are looking at financing, as an option as a way to improve the affordability of these products, in spite of maybe their concerns around a slowdown in the economy. So, again, not giving specific guidance on the close rates, but we are continuing to see improvements there kind of sequentially, or at least over the prior year. And I don't think that we'll return quite to pre pandemic levels by this year. I don't think that that's not what our guide contemplates. So, maybe that's upside for us as we continue to recover there.
Operator: Thank you. One moment please, for our next question. Our next question will come from Michael Halloran of Baird. Your line is open.
Michael Halloran : Good morning, everyone. So, let's stick on that train of thought Aaron, because obviously there's a lot of concern and questions just around the sustainability of that home standby piece from an underlying demand perspective. And, we've certainly seen the positive or heard certainly heard the positive commentary on the IHC side. Would love to understand why the confidence level is so high that you can maintain that and also maybe put in historical perspective how you've tracked when you had kind of negative economy, but positive storms in the past, I know New York made a quick reference to it in the prepared remarks. But you know, just kind of laying out why you think things are going to be, from an underlying perspective, pretty stable, moving into the back half would be great.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, that's obviously an area of deep focus for us, Mike. And we've got some experience around that. And I'll pop these out here in a second. But I think just talking to the trends, and what gives us confidence the second half of the year. So the way we think about it, those sales leads, which are important leading indicator and a category for us, they mature over a period of 90 to 120 days call it, from when you do the consultation to when the product actually gets installed. So we think that in terms of near term visibility, right, next quarter, quarter and a half, perhaps, we think we have a pretty good view on the kind of the end market demand as it were. That coupled with the fact that we're under serving the market right now, right, like we're under shipping to and market demand, because we're allowing this destock process to take place. So I would just say that, Q1, artificially low, relative to what home standby shipments could have been, had we been matching kind of the shipping pace with the demand pace, right. So we were out of step with that, because of the field inventory challenges that we've talked much about here.  So you put those together, and those we're pacing to have that debate, as we enter the second half of the year. We think that that's something that's going to improve, as we said, we're going get back to more normal levels there. So we return to more normal levels there, you also have normal seasonality, right, the first half of the year, Q1 in particular, is always a challenging quarter for the category because it's just difficult to do installations.  In fact, this Q1, some of the reasons why we saw so many home consultations with the outage environment, being driven by weather also provided some challenges to our installed crews in terms of them being able to actually install product in Q1. So it was a little bit of a kind of a bit of an irony there. But so take that out of it, though, and we look to the future.  And then kind of just Speaking more broadly, I think, to our experience in the category, when you have maybe a softening economic backdrop, I can point to the last kind of pullback economically back in 2008 2009, when you look at housing in particular, and I would say I would argue this rest this recessionary, I got to be careful the term I use, but the slowdown in the economy right now that we're -- that people are concerned about or experiencing is not necessarily the same type of experience that happened in ’08 ‘09. Well, it's directly related to housing prices, home values, mortgage, obviously, the value of your home relative to your mortgage, with housing prices kind of collapsing back then.  And if there was ever a time, when you think that like, what we get pegged at in this category, we pegged as a big ticket discretionary item, right, tied to residential investment, you would have thought that would have been the worst environment ever, for this category back in ‘08 ’09 we actually grew our residential part of our business back then.  So, and I -- there's a bunch of reasons for that. I mean, first of all, the category goes to older right, so 65% of the buyers of the category are over age 60. And so I don't want to say they're insulated necessarily from economic pullbacks. But I would say that they probably are less affected. I also mentioned, the use of our financing tools, we're seeing an increase in use of the financing tool. So I think we have some things today that help homeowners who are still interested in the category shop the category and still become buyers. And I think the biggest thing over my time here, almost three decades of the company, is that power outages, Trump the economy every day of the week.  I mean, when your power's out, the generator categories go right to the top of the list, we maybe get reshuffled, maybe that kitchen remodel or that new pool you were thinking about, or even a family vacation gets further down the list. And a generator becomes the priority in terms of what you're going to spend your discretionary income on, or your home, -- put value in your home into home equity infusion. So anyway, that's just kind of how we think about it largely. And I think why I think the category has been relatively resilient over the last three decades.
Operator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning, guys. Just, can you quantify maybe how much inventory you think came out of the channel in 1Q and what you think that number looks like in 2Q? And if I could just sneak in a commercial one, just what prevents you from kind of raising the bar there, given the strong start? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. All good questions, I think on the field inventory, the way we describe, it was a meaningful decrease in the inventory numbers there. That was really the big thing to look at and we've mentioned this before the days of field inventory, right. So we mentioned, I think, in the third quarter, last year, we were about double where we thought we needed to be. That was kind of, and we made progress down to about 1.7 times, when we got to kind of the Q4 call here in February.  Now we think that range is somewhere in the 1.4 to 1.5 times, kind of “normal”. There's some debate about what normal means. But we're looking at our history, in the categories, and we're making good progress. That's all in line, we also said it wasn't going to be a linear pull down here. Because of the seasonality, primarily the way Q1 works, just installs being normally seasonally lower in Q1, we just knew that it wasn't going to kind of linearly dropped from 1.7 to 1.35 to one times at the end of Q2. But we feel like we're progressing right where we want to be. And again, we're buoyed by the fact that we see the end market demand remaining very robust. So we feel like this is going to be, we're going to get to where we need to get to there, down the line.  Now, I would just say the reason you kind of point out, why didn't why not take up kind of the guidance based on the outperformance in Q1. The outperformance primarily came from C&I. So our C&I business was crushing it, which is awesome, especially internationally Pramac team, we were able to acquire now we own 100% of that business, which is awesome. And they've been a significant part of our global expansion here as a company over the last seven years.  But that said, one of the big kind of drivers, one of the verticals in there that we've always talked about is our telecom business. And we are seeing some lumpiness in kind of the back half of the year relative to some of our channel partners there, right, we serve all the major wireless telecom companies, as well as the co-locators in the marketplace. And a couple of those accounts for us, we've delivered a lot of products, and they've got to get that product installed now. So they're working through, they got --, so that maybe pulled some of that in is what it maybe looks like.  But all indications, as we talked to them about their CapEx spending and kind of what they need to do to harden their networks going forward, as they think about the next generation technology or fifth generation 5g technologies. They're all -- this is a secular cycle right now for telecom, in terms of CapEx spending and building on networks. And so we think it's just, kind of just the lumpiness that we see from time to time. And that's really why we didn't take up the guide in the back half. It's really related to that. That's kind of a simple answer. There's some moving pieces underneath that. But that's, that's really it. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer, your line is open. 
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about the -- you mentioned the home consultations for HSP were up significantly in almost all the states. So I want you to dive into that a little bit. And then also clarify the expectation for residential growth in the second half. Does that explicitly include growth in 3Q? Or if not, are you biased in that respect to see least a bit of top line positive from resi in 3Q? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, thanks, Chris. Maybe just I'll address that first. Yes, we are seeing a return to growth starting in the third quarter. So that is the expectation and the way we've met the guidance around residential. More specifically, to the commentary about home consultations, being very broad based, right. Almost all states, I think, what was really encouraging again, and this, this is what I think is different from kind of pre pandemic periods to today. And as you may recall, we mentioned that just consultations in general up dramatically from that pre pandemic, pre pandemic period, you know, almost really more in 4x off of that base.  And I think when you when you step back, and you look at that kind of pre pandemic fit today, it is the broad based nature of that growth that's really encouraging for us and I think speaks to just again, I can't stress enough to where we're at in this journey, this is a category of product home standby generators, still less than 6% penetrated single family, U.S. House is greater than $150,000 in value. Every 1% penetration is a $3 billion market opportunity. And we have 75% share of the market. So when we think about the opportunity ahead of us, and we look at the growth that we're experiencing in states, obviously a couple of examples and also Canada in there as well.  So we can talk territories and provinces as well as states, because Canada has been just on fire for us because they have also been experiencing, much as we have here in the U.S. in increasing frequency of outages and the duration of those outages. And I think what's different today from the outages four years ago, and what drove people to category four years ago, is what's causing those outages, whether it's still kind of largely, the cause behind most outages. But I think what we're also seeing, and what homeowners and businesses are seeing is that the grid is struggling to deliver, right.  So and what I mean by that is as we race to electrify everything, heating, cooking, cooling transportation, you're seeing demand through seen supply be outstripped by demand. And it happens very rapidly. This was on full display in the Carolinas over Christmas over the Christmas holiday. So utility companies in the Carolinas were struggling to keep up with the demand surge because it got so cold, that everybody turned on their heat pumps and their electric baseboard heaters, which created an enormous amount of demand on the system that was unplanned. And that system had it struggled to keep up with it. So they had to resort to rolling brownouts rolling blackouts in order to keep the system up.  And that's the kind of difference I think, between today and four years ago that we look at, and we see as being -- I think a basic part of the story going forward. And I just think, when you talk about the states where we're seeing the most growth, so let's just step back, our top five states from a penetration standpoint, are also our top five growth states, in terms of the penetration rate accelerate highest growth rates. So like, it's not like you get to a point of kind of where you saturated the market in the states, they're continuing to grow.  In fact, I would say, you might question whether it maybe there's a tipping point that a state gets to, is it 10% penetrated, and then it accelerates, we definitely have seen evidence over the last several years, that if you just look at the top five states from an emirate standpoint, they are also almost always the top five growth states over time. So it's very interesting to see how this continues to almost the penetration rates continue to accelerate as awareness for the category deepens. And as these challenges around grid reliability, continue to become more apparent to homeowners and businesses.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark Strouse of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Mark Strouse : Yes. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking our questions. York, I wanted to go back to your comments on pricing, the pricing action, the kind of benefiting gross margin. How broad based of a comment is that is that resi, and C&I. And then kind of what does the guidance imply regarding future price action this year?
York Ragen: Yes, it's, at least for the first quarter it applied for the most across the board. On the resi side, and particularly home standby side, the last price increase that kicked in with June 1 of 2022. So we're still in the process of analyzing that price increase on the home standby side. And then on the C&I side, there were a number of price increases that came through here in the beginning of 2023. We had them in 2022. But there was another round in 2023 that should continue on so. So I'd say more of a price impact in the first half as you as we haven't analyzed the home standby side yet, but still yet some benefit in the back half on the C&I side.
Operator: Thank you. One moment, please for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Drab of William Blair. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is Tyler on for Brian. So I just want to kind of transition to the clean energy products. And what are you doing there to improve the distribution capabilities? And then a follow up with that, the $300 million to $350 million guide for the full year in clean -- resi, clean energy. Can you kind of give some direction to each of the products like ecobee, power cell and grid services and what their potential is for the full year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Tyler. So yes, so we're working very hard to rebuild not only the distribution, obviously, to replace the loss of that customer in the third quarter last year but also confidence, right, in the marketplace. I mean we stumbled with execution with this -- one of the companies we acquired that had a component that we've struggled with the overall longevity of that component, and we're going through that upgrade campaign, the SnapRS upgrade campaign that we've talked about at length. And we took the charge for last 3Q making good progress there, by the way. And I would tell you that we're getting high marks from the distribution partners that we're involved with on that campaign in terms of standby products, taking care of the issues. They've seen different OEMs, deal with different issues over the course of kind of the solar markets early days to today, right? Like I mean, a lot of OEMs, I think they can struggle. It's a challenging environment, rooftop-mounted electronics that have a long warranty period and duty cycle that we're constantly running for the most part. So they run a lot. So it's something that we learned a lot doing and I think we're making really good strides rebuilding that. We've got some, I think, some pretty good green shoots that we're excited about there, probably more towards the back half of the year. There was a little bit of field inventory to work through there as well, as you can imagine, with kind of the abrupt closure of that distribution partner in Q3 last year and kind of the way the market kind of ground to a halt for us. We had to work through some of the inventory that was in the field there, too. It wasn't nearly to the same degree as what we had with our home standby business but we're working through that. And that market also has had some, I would say, some jobs lessen right around some of the new rules around NEM 3.0 and waiting for the IRA to be finalized. What does that really mean in terms of what's available for tax credits and things? So as that gets clearer to homeowners and to distribution partners going forward, we see that market continue to recover throughout the year.  We're not going to give specific breakdowns on the different pieces, but we can tell you that obviously, ecobee, which we called out specifically in the prepared remarks today, has been doing really well. I mean they are -- their smart thermostat product line is doing great. They're going to be launching a smart doorbell cam alongside of that here in the second half of the year, which we're really excited about. Already being very well received by some of the channel partners that today sell our smart thermostats. They're very excited to carry these products as well. And we've had a couple of nice wins there that will have some placement where we'll do some load-ins in the second half of the year. So we're talking about -- that's a part of the story here in the 300 to 350 guide and then also grid services off of a low base, but a nice rate of growth here in Q1. And we continue to see that growing still again, small base, but there's a lot of discussion with a lot of utilities and grid operators about the importance of meeting these types of digital solutions to help them manage these potential bridge shortfalls that I talked about previously. And they see something like our Concerto platform that is at the heart of our grid services team. They see that Concerto platform as a way to -- just another tool in the toolkit to deal with potential shortfalls in supply when you see spikes in demand. So more to come on all that, but I think we bottomed. I guess it's the message here. We feel like we're going to come off the bottom in Q1, green shoots ahead for those businesses and good momentum in things like ecobee and the good services team.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. I'm wondering if you could just talk about the fourth quarter margin outlook and maybe just outline your expectations for year-over-year cost declines that are embedded in the guidance within the context of pricing as well as you folks go back towards doing some level of promotions versus not doing them a year ago. Just wondering how much does that pressure price realization? And if we could just bridge how much of the year-over-year margin improvement in 4Q we expect from price cost? That would be helpful, if you don't mind.
York Ragen: Yes. Jerry, this is York. I know we're contemplating that EBITDA margins get back to those low 20% range that we're used to by Q4, as we talked about. Specifically, we talked about at least first half, second half, that EBITDA margin should improve about 800 basis points sequentially, first half, second half with, I'd say, roughly, let's say, 3% of that 800 -- 300 of the 800 basis points just as a function of mix in that home standby as we normalize inventory and seasonally increase first half, second half. Home standby mix is going to improve dramatically relative to the first quarter and first half so you get about 3% improvement in margin just right there, first half, second half. We are anticipating about 2% improvement in just input costs with commodities, logistics, continued improvement there. We've got a number of cost reductions we're working on plant inefficiencies, its better absorption, again, sequentially first half, second half that will improve about 2% of that 800, first half, second half improvement.  And then the remaining 3% is really just operating leverage on the much higher sales volumes on our -- leveraging that OpEx infrastructure. So that's really the bridge at least sequentially. Year-over-year, like I said, they'll probably be modest. Most of the pricing will have lapped on a year-over-year basis by Q4. So a lot of that is just more cost improvement and mix improvements year-over-year will drive that as well as -- that will drive most of the year-over-year improvement from Q4 last year to Q4 this year.
Operator: Our next question will come from Joseph Osha of Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Joseph Osha: Thanks very much. I wanted to return to the Residential Clean Energy business a little bit. Obviously, as you go through this reset. One of the questions, I think, that's come up is around the residential home architecture and the fact that you're advancing sort of 2 parallel inverter architectures at the same time, which drives a lot of complexity in the other parts of the system. So I'm wondering if you're able to maybe give us any clarity today or when we might have some clarity in terms of how you intend to move forward with those multiple architectures.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Joe, it's a great question. We talked a little bit about this, maybe not publicly but maybe one on one with you in particular because I think you've been focused on this space quite a bit, which is great. We've got a brand-new team that's running that business. And we bought a lot of technology and platform over the last four years. And so I think the viewpoint on how best to deploy that technology, the first order of kind of focus, if you will, is integrating as much of it as we can, right? Like I think that is -- we always knew there was a heavy lift coming there with all of the companies that we've acquired. Some of them start up, some of them more at a scale level like ecobee and trying to figure out what is the -- where can we add the most value, right? I think we're a little bit agnostic about which -- if you're speaking strictly about inverter technologies, which inverter technology is going to "win", right? I mean, I don't know that we see this as a VHS Betamax kind of fight as much as we just see it as two different paths to achieve a similar outcome, right?  There's just different technologies that are different -- are available. And I do think that it's -- your point about having -- if you have to cover too much ground, if I can just kind of paraphrase it, too much ground that might -- is that really the right way to go? Is that the most efficient path in terms of how much calorie burn we use to support 2 different architectures? I think over time, I think we'll become -- it will become clearer which architectures or which architecture may be the best for us. And this is as we go through and we start thinking about as we have been working on our next-generation storage products, you have to be cognizant though that there's a huge market out there where we want to be able to add storage to existing homes that are already invested in solar. And those homes may have -- they could be DC-coupled, they could be AC-coupled in terms of their architecture from an inverter standpoint. So how do we put that -- how do we make sure that we keep a -- and then we get a product to market that can serve the entire existing solar market. So we're looking at that. And then we know that we need to be in the market or we need to have a product that keeps us in the market for solar only, right? If we just focus on solar plus storage, that's going to limit -- too limiting for us, we believe. Today, attachment rates are 15% to 20%, that's and they're growing, which is great. That still means there's a high percentage of new solar installs that don't have storage being installed. We just we want to participate in that market. So finding a pathway that gets us there and get us there most economically and where we can add the most value is really important. So more to come on that. We do have an Investor Day that we've got scheduled here for September. So I think we'll be prepared to discuss that in more detail in September, but know that the team is continuing to look at that and figure out just exactly strategically what's going to make the most sense for us long term.
Operator: Our next question will come from Kashy Harrison of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Kashy Harrison : Good morning. And thanks for taking the question. So there's a lot of uncertainty in the market from a banking and financing perspective. Just curious if you could give us a sense of how the uncertain financing environment is impacting operations for your dealer and channel partners? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's a great question. We obviously, you would think that they might be impacted by that, but largely they're not. They pays by credit card, a lot of dealers are they like the points that they accumulate on their American Express and their different card programs. And so we tend to see credit card payments being kind of one big path to paying us. They also use our floor plan financing program very aggressively, and that's been a program that has been a very successful program for us. It allows the dealer to kind of derisk their ability to bring product in. We want to have them have some inventory level, and we have subsidized the cost out for 180 days. Exactly. They don't bear that cost. So it's really our cost for the first 180 days, they get free floor plan financing. So we kind of derisk that for them. So in terms of like their overall direct exposure, we haven't heard much in the way of them seeing any kind of compression. There is more of a project-based business and where they're probably going to see more challenges if housing were to slow down, right?  And that's a real risk out there, of course, as we've talked. But in terms of like their projects flow, because they're paid kind of as they go, right, on a progress basis. So if that kind of progress flow or that project flow were to dry up, that's probably where they would feel more pain. But we haven't heard any or seen any evidence directly around that. That is our view.
Operator: Our next question will come from George Gianarikas of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.
George Gianarikas: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. And believe it or not, I actually had a power outage during this call, and I'm not a Generac customer yet. So my question actually just to jump on the previous one with regards to that there's spasms that we're seeing in financial markets. How does that impact your C&I business? How much of it is project-related that we may see some sort of impact if this continues on projects related to renewables?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, that's a great question. Typically, so you want to look at nonresidential construction spending. It's an interesting indicator for us. And I would tell you that business tends to be late cycle, right? So we typically see our res business is more of an early-cycle business in terms of how it reacts to economic cycles, even though as we've mentioned here today, both prepared remarks and on the Q&A, it's probably less sensitive because as power outages happen, homeowners, they react. It's a more emotional category.  Although in the C&I side, I think that as non res construction may slow down in the future and that category is late cycle, you could see that breakdown. You have to think about the megatrend, if you step back for a second, telecom has one really major important vertical for us there. As I said in the prepared remarks and in some of the Q&A, very much in a secular up-cycle market here in terms of CapEx spending for the telcos. And so that's a really important vertical for us.  The other one is, I think, the -- just the increasing penetration rate of backup power, much the same as what's been occurring in residential, businesses just like yourself, they're struggling with outages, right? Like they're having outages happen more frequently. It's interrupting their revenue streams. It's causing spoilage of inventory or destruction of processes when things are in process, if you're a manufacturer in particular. So we're seeing power backup power being added to businesses that in the past hadn't thought about it as part of their strategy around resiliency, right, or a lot of businesses referred to it as disaster recovery strategies, right? So their DR strategies didn't include backup power or a generator. We're now seeing backup power be added to that. We're also seeing increasing codes and standards that are driving generators as a requirement. We saw in California with the requirement for 48 hours of backup in telecommunications sites. We also are seeing certain states adopt what Florida adopted several years ago in the elderly care spaces and the health care spaces, a requirement that those facilities, those types of facilities have a minimum of 48 hours of backup power.  Those are new codes and standards. So you're seeing kind of maybe some of the softness in nonresidential construction spend in the future, I think it's going to be potentially more than offset by the increasing need for resiliency. And some of these megatrends as we refer to them are the secular trends that you're seeing in telecom and in infrastructure spending for that matter.
York Ragen: And on the renewables side, we're not necessarily focused on utility scale or front-of-the-meter project. So any financing breakdowns with those projects wouldn't necessarily impact that.
Operator: Our next question will come from Donovan Schafer of Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Donovan Schafer: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So I had this thesis going into these results that I was thinking again following all the outage events that the geographic diversification of them in East Coast, West Coast, Canada, even Gulf Coast that could help drive down channel inventory like actually faster than you expected, kind of the logic was maybe there will be a pocket here or there where the labor -- the installation bottleneck would be weaker, and it's kind of like more roles of the dice, if you will, like probabilistically, you get more rolls, these different geographies you might find under the right characteristics. You're pretty clear in the call that the inventory drawdown was in line with your expectations, but also clear that, yes, in fact, based on your analysis, outage activity in aggregate was well above the historical average. So I'm figuring the disconnect there probably comes down to the installation bottleneck and that it is perhaps more uniform than I was thinking. But if you could just kind of like if you have the above-average activity in the first quarter, is it that continuing labor bottleneck that doesn't lead you to having more optimistic outlook for home standby back of generators going into the second or for basically the remainder of the year? If you get that since you're already assuming baseline average kind of your typical outlook, then if we already have some of this, is it just you don't -- there's not really an end in sight on the installation restriction or just kind of what's going on there? And then also just because these were geographically diverse, it'd be nice to just get an update on how they're unfolding because you probably have a clear signal, if you will, from your data. We've got a cluster of events, there's Hurricane Ian, the East Coast ice storms in Christmas, you talked about and you gave some interesting commentary there, the unique nature of it, the Midwest storms, there are the Quebec outages. Just any -- how are those unfolding? Have you seen the demand surge in -- from Hurricane Ian at this point and the installations are happening? I mean that was a long time ago at this point. So just kind of fleshing out that.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Donovan. So I would say your thesis is correct. But I think what you probably aren't appreciating is that there's a time sense there that from when we get a sales lead to when it becomes sales and when it gets installed, there's permitting involved. And again, we've said anywhere between 90, 120 days, and that's down from what it used to be, mainly because that's a longer lead times and the permitting processes were elevated in some markets with COVID kind of driving that elevation or that elongated kind of permitting process. That's -- so it's shorter today than it was, say, maybe a couple of years ago, where it was out as high as 180 days or longer in some cases. So we really got to let those sales leads, right? It's a sales funnel. So they go in at the top of the funnel. And then there's a conversion process and that conversion process takes some time. So we would anticipate that kind of as we exit kind of Q2 and get into the second half of the year, that's going to definitely start reading through. And that's what gives us the confidence around the kind of the second half guide that we're talking about here in spite of maybe the weaker backdrop economically overall. So we feel really good about that.  In terms of installation bandwidth, I would just say that Q1 is always a tough install quarter. It's always our lowest because winter weather sets in and you just can't do those installs in Northeast and the Upper Midwest in particular. But what we also saw this year was in California, in Northern Cal, even parts of Southern Cal, the weather was just so aggressive that we just think installers could not get out and get the product on the ground. So we saw those headwinds, which actually created tailwinds for us in the sales consultation and sales leads created some headwinds for us on the installation side. We -- all indications are we're making really good progress on installation bandwidth. That is going to continue to expand. It's expanded every year, by the way. Every year, we've been in this category, it's expanded. So we don't have any reason to believe that we've kind of topped out there. And we -- as we've said last year, kind of after realizing that was a constraint for the first time ever for us, we really kind of refocused our efforts around adding new distribution partners, looking for ways to make them more efficient, improving our product, right?  So making it easier to install, helping them hire the talent they need. We stood up something we call our dealer talent network, which is now in full force, and we're helping dealers hire installation crews that they -- one of the reasons they told us they couldn't expand installation bandwidth last year because we couldn't find people.  They said, okay, let's figure out how we solve that together, right? So when we have the kind of scale we have with 8,600 channel partners or 8,600 dealer partners, we can put a lot of effort towards those things and they can have kind of meaningful outcomes. So I think we're making all the right things happen. And I think what your thesis maybe just didn't take into consideration is the time line around kind of letting those sales leads mature into kind of installation. So that's coming, and we expect to see that kind of as we exit Q2 and enter the second half of the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from Praneeth Satish of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. I know you talked about eco being the single pane of glass, but I guess it's somewhat limited in terms of what it can actually display. So I'm wondering with the smart doorbell that you're launching later this year and HSB being integrated, is there a thought of maybe upgrading the display and processing capabilities of ecobee and having it really compete in the smart home with Amazon and Google and the like?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, absolutely. Great question. One of the great things we love about ecobee is the display is fantastic in that thing. In fact, with the doorbell cam, I have one in my house on a beta trial right now. If somebody pushes your doorbell, if you have -- if you're anywhere near your ecobee thermostat and you can have that thermostat anywhere in your house, you can have multiple thermostats. It actually displays the doorbell camera on the thermostat. It's cool. It's cool as hell, really. I mean, I got to be honest, it's like -- it is one of the more cool features of the ecobee device. It's one of the reasons why I think this is a really key point and I'll make it that you give me the opportunity to do that. We want to use it as the central hub for energy in the home, right? So we want to use it -- I mean, we're going to use it, obviously, for the doorbell cam. But the ability to as we just did, we integrated, if you have a Generac generator in your home and you have an ecobee thermostat, your ecobee thermostat will tell you if your generator -- it will show you on the screen, on the display. It will tell you any fault messages you may have. It will tell you when it's running in exercise mode. It will tell you when it's running during the power outage. It will show you the status of that generator. We're going to be integrating our tank utility, which is our LP tank monitoring device into that next. Then we're going to look at our water heater disconnect switches and integrate those next. Other energy devices like our storage device are on -- also on the docket to be integrated into the ecobee thermostat. Our premise here has been that people looked at us and said, well, why did you buy ecobee back in December of '21. You're going into HVAC thermostat, no, we need a hub in the home, right? Only less than 6% of homes have a home standby generator and even smaller percentage have storage solar and storage. But almost every home has HVAC, right, the nice ones anyway. And every home has a thermostat. So the opportunity, just the raw opportunity for us to enter the home with a device that's low cost and it has a tremendous amount of power inside of it. In fact, Stuart Lombard, who is the principal and the founder of that company would tell you that effectively, that's like your iPhone mounted on the wall in terms of the display quality, in terms of the processing power, the memory, they're fantastic, too. If you use that product and you use the app that is with the product, their -- the user experience is tremendous. Their user interface is intuitive, it's easy to use, and it's smart, right? Like the sensors understand where you are in the home, they can react in terms of your presence in the home, their ability to sense your presence, their ability to save you energy is well documented by installing one of these thermostats. So we just really like the product and we like the user experience. And we think that having it be the central part of our single-pane-of-glass strategy is incredibly important going forward.
Operator: The next question will come from Jordan Levy of Truist. Your line is open.
Jordan Levy: Just a quick one for me on the M&A side. I just wanted to get a sense of after closing some of these recent deals, what segments your appetite might be directed towards as we move through the year and how you view the current opportunity landscape for M&A?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Jordan, thanks, and thank you for hanging out. This is -- the call has been long, but glad to be able to take the question. We've been very active on the M&A front over the last decade and acquired 30-plus companies here now in total. As we've really grown, not only grown on geographic presence through those acquisitions, but our presence into adjacent spaces. And then also, as we've gone through -- and as we think about the evolution into an energy technology company going forward. And it's been very rewarding. We've learned a lot. Not all the deals have worked. Some have worked better than others. But I would tell you that we find ourselves in a much different position today than when we were only growing organically, right? We have never done an acquisition prior to our first one in 2010.  As far as what we're thinking about in the future for acquisitions, we're still going to be active in this space. You've seen us do a couple here little bit more bolt-on in nature, adding some pieces like the Rolling Energy Resources acquisition, the investment we made there was really around trying to add to enhance the Concerto platform, right, around EV management EV charging management. The REFU Energy Storage acquisition that we did over in Germany was about C&I energy storage on a stationary basis. We had done off-grid energy last year or year before summer before, and that was over in the U.K., gave us a great product portfolio to go after really primarily the rental channel with those types of products. But we knew that the C&I stationary market is a market that we've got also go after. And so REFU Storage was a way for us to enter that market. We're going to continue to look at, I think, as the energy technology space continues to evolve and in particular, there are a couple of notable areas where I think we still have -- I don't want to say gaps is not as much as I say, opportunities to accelerate our entry, EV charging, right? We're going to get to market with an EV charger here later this year on the residential side. But it's -- honestly, it's a private label effort. We're partnering with somebody. It will be unique to Generac, but we believe an organic effort there, longer term is what we need. So maybe something in that space, valuations have just been really high and remain high in that space. So we've gone after it a little bit differently, but should that picture change, we could become active there. And then on the C&I side, and then maybe anything internationally, you think about some of the things that we've done on the residential energy technology side as well as the C&I energy technology side, we were to find additional pieces that might fit internationally on the residential side. That's an area like we don't really have an energy storage product for anything outside of North America at this point. So if there's a way for us to enter the markets in Europe or other markets through an acquisition that might be something to look at. And then also, just looking at acqui hire, we've done a couple of -- where we acquired a couple of development companies to help us with accelerate our acqui-hire environment. Obviously, maybe the picture has changed on the tech employment base here with some of the bigger firms pulling back, and maybe that's not going to be as challenging to hire people as it had been in the last couple of years. But we continue to look at the environment, things kind of come and go. Opportunities are put in front of us time and again, but we're going to remain active on that front.
Operator: Our next question will come from [indiscernible] Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking the question. Just stepping out of the quarterly cadence here. Within the residential clean energy space, we've seen a lot of company announcements are on bidirectional chargers. How are you thinking about the effect of vehicle-to-home on home standby demand in the medium term, say, three to five years? And as you sort of alluded to in your prepared remarks, through a lot of acquisitions, you have many parts of the home-energy puzzle in your clean energy business. Could you kindly contextualize your in-house and/or M&A-based EV charging ambitions beyond the level two announcements that you've made?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. No, great question. And obviously, we watch -- we're watching with great interest kind of the EV penetration rates. Fundamentally, I do think that EVs, look, they're a large battery that for most people are going -- you're going to be charging at home, right? So you're going to have an EV charger in your garage or carport and you're going to want to plug that vehicle in, of course, to charge it. And as its sitting there charging, I think that the ability to control the rate of charge, the time of charge is going to be really critical. Now you can do both of those with a level two charger today and some level of integration with some home energy management type of system. By directional charging, of course, would indicate that you're going to be able to use that battery for some other purpose, either to export power to the grid or perhaps use it for resiliency purposes. I do think that at least in the medium term, the three- to five-year window, we don't see much of an impact on the EV and bidirectional charging opportunity on home standby generators.  I think it's much, much longer term as EV pen rates become more ubiquitous and perhaps as homes go from having a single EV to maybe two EVs, and the reason for that, in my view, is fairly simple. I don't think that homeowners are going to be willing to trade resiliency for mobility. I just -- I think, flat out that you're going to want to have some level of stationary storage or perhaps backup power available at your home for outages -- for long-duration outages in particular, a generator is going to be the way to solve that. In fact, what we're seeing and what we may see near term and perhaps even long term, depending on how people view mobility and resiliency and how they feel about that, I think that generators actually could see some level of increased interest once you buy an EV because I think your mindset goes to, okay, if my power is out, right -- first of all, bidirectional charging by the way, is a -- it's a new technology. It is a somewhat unregulated space relative to the codes and standards around it.  And there's also a fairly large open question as to whether the OEMs -- the auto OEMs, how much control will they give a third party with control of their basically their battery, right? And in terms of what does that mean for the warranty of that battery in terms of the charge cycles, the discharge cycles, charge rates, discharge rates. That is a fairly open question at this point. I do think it will get resolved over time. And so to that end, we're putting quite a bit of an effort towards EV charging beyond just the level 2 charger. We've got some organic efforts internally here with design teams that are looking at the space to understand how do we want to approach it beyond the level 2.  I think that the first thing -- the first order of business for us is getting our own level 2 charging structure and infrastructure put together and then integrating that deeply into home energy management. So that what we can do there is to help the homeowner manage the charging of that vehicle. And that has benefit for not only the homeowner in terms of the cost of what it may talk -- what it may take to charge that vehicle, but also in terms of the local utility or grid operator because they are the ones who are going to struggle the most as people add EV charging capability to their homes, there's a pretty difficult upgrade cycle coming on the hard infrastructure.  The lines, the poles, the transformers that serve those local neighborhoods where EV charging is being implemented. Those are very heavy draw loads. I mean, that's a pretty significant energy draw at the home. And in fact, in some cases, can double the home's electrical use just by adding an EV charger. So I think there's a lot to come on that. We're going to unpack that a little bit more when we get to the IR day in September, but great question and an area of great interest for us going forward.
Operator: That will end the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mike Harris for closing remarks.
Mike Harris: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning, and we look forward to discussing our second quarter 2023 earnings results with you in early August. Thank you, again, and goodbye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-15 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Fourth Quarter Full Year 2022 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mike Harris, Senior VP, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Mike Harris: Good morning. And welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable US GAAP measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong momentum in our Commercial and Industrial product categories during the quarter, but softer residential product sales, resulted in consolidated net sales at the low end of our previous guidance range. Specifically, higher home standby field inventory levels continue to impact orders and shipments in the fourth quarter and clean energy product shipments were lower as we work to further improve the reliability of these products and expand our distribution capabilities. Year-over-year, overall net sales decreased 2% to $1.05 billion and core sales declined 7% during the quarter. Residential product sales decreased 19% from the prior year due to the previously mentioned home standby and clean energy products headwinds. C&I product sales increased 27% on a year-over-year basis with robust core sales growth across all channels domestically and all regions internationally. Adjusted EBITDA margins declined during the quarter as the unfavorable effect of sales mix, reduced operating leverage and the increase in recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions were partially offset by favorable price cost dynamics. For the full year 2022, Generac achieved another year of record top line growth with total net sales increasing 22% over 2021, which marked our third consecutive year of double digit growth. While residential product shipments faced headwinds in the second half of 2022, the category still experienced strong year-over-year growth of approximately 19%. Additionally, sales of our C&I products have never been stronger, as global shipments grew 26% over the prior year, resulting in $1.26 billion in annual sales. We exited 2022 with record backlog for these products, setting our expectations for another strong year in 2023. In addition to record net sales, our international segment achieved all time highs and adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins for the year as we continue to benefit from increasing global demand for backup power and mobile products. Also, our strong liquidity position allowed us to opportunistically repurchase more than 2.7 million shares during the year. Before discussing fourth quarter results in more detail, I want to provide an update on the progress we made over the course of the year to advance our evolution into an energy technology solutions company and discuss the continued development of the powerful mega trends that are driving our business. Despite the softer second half of 2022 for our residential products, we continue to make important progress in building out our portfolio of energy technology related solutions during the year. Importantly, we began assembling a significantly deeper and more experienced leadership team focused on improving and advancing our clean energy product and distribution capabilities, while further integrating the multiple energy technology investments we've made in recent years. We also continue to develop and invest in numerous new technologies and capabilities, including taking a minority equity interest, investment in WATT fuel cell, acquiring Blue Pillar and launching our single pane of glass initiative. Blue Pillar's capabilities provide us with the foundation for connecting our growing portfolio of C&I focused energy technology solutions, while our single pane of glass initiative is focused on developing the end user interface or central hub of our smart home energy ecosystem and heavily leverages ecobee's platform development expertise. We also brought multiple new solutions to market during the year as we began shipping our second generation load control device called PWRmanager, launched a line of portable battery solutions called Portable Power Stations and announced new EV charging solutions for utilities and EV owners. Our grid services team also announced several additional project wins during 2022 and had a strong year across several key operating metrics. Additionally, the mega trends that drive the long term growth trajectory of our business became even more evident in 2022. Extreme weather and multiple high profile outage events further highlighted the poor reliability of the US power grid, while war and geopolitical instability in Europe forced consumers and businesses to evaluate the importance of energy security. The home is a sanctuary and aging in place trends that are helping drive demand for residential backup power solutions remain very compelling. A structural shift in consumer preferences and work habits in the US in recent years has further increased sensitivity to power outages with the percentage of individuals working from home tripling and home health referral volumes doubling since 2019. As the effects of climate change become increasingly evident, the policy backdrop for our energy technology solutions has never been more favorable. Most notably with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing additional conviction for us to maintain a long term focus with our investments in energy technology. Additionally, increased federal infrastructure spending and the ongoing upgrade of global telecom networks help support our future growth expectations for our C&I products as well. The massive changes taking place with our nation's power grid are yet another mega trend that continues to strengthen as growing demand for electricity is met with less reliable supply. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, approximately 25% of Americans are at high risk of resource adequacy shortfalls during normal seasonal peak conditions in the 2023 to 2027 period due to the growing supply demand imbalances across our power grid. With the electrification of everything trends accelerating and the growing penetration of EVs, coupled with an increasingly higher mix of supply from intermittent renewable power generation sources, we believe this megatrend will drive a significant focus on the need for power resiliency for years to come. NERC's high risk categorization comes before considering the notable increase in severe and volatile weather we've witnessed in recent years, which we believe only further magnifies the need for reliable decentralized energy technology solutions. Now discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail. Residential product sales declined at a double digit rate as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower home standby shipments in the quarter resulting from higher field inventory levels. However, end market conditions continued to be strong during the quarter. Baseline power outage activity in the US was above the long term average with winter storm Elliot and other larger localized outages providing yet another [Technical Difficulty] reminder of the fragility of our electrical infrastructure. The extreme temperatures over the holiday season created a surge in demand for power for residential heating and coincided with supply disruptions as the nation's largest grid operator saw nearly a quarter of its power plants fall offline, resulting in rolling blackouts. This event took place in an especially inconvenient and sensitive time for many households, further supporting the continued increase in consumer awareness of the growing need for backup power solutions. Home consultations or sales leads in the quarter remain strong, matching the record high for our fourth quarter period in the prior year. Additionally, home consultations for full year 2022 were more than 3 times 2019 levels. This strength has continued early in 2023 with home consultations growing again on a year-over-year basis and reaching record levels for the month of January following the holiday season outage activity. We remain focused on expanding our distribution network as we experienced sequential growth in our residential dealer base and ended the quarter with more than 8,700 dealer partners, a net increase of approximately 200 dealers from the third quarter. Activations, which are a proxy for installations, grew at a robust rate in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, and also grew sequentially as a result of increased install bandwidth. In addition to this encouraging growth in activations and dealer count, we also experienced sequential improvement in close rates and dealer project lead times. Although, these two metrics are not yet back to normalize levels. The number of home standby generators and field inventory declined sequentially during the fourth quarter, and are down more than 20% from r peak levels, benefiting from reduced production rates and record activation levels in the quarter. Days of field inventory, which considers recent trends and activation rates, also declined sequentially during the fourth quarter. However, relative to historic seasonal patterns, days of field inventory are still well above normalized levels as of the end of 2022. We expect that field inventory levels will remain elevated through the first half of 2023, which will continue to weigh on orders and shipments of home standby generators during the first and second quarters. Improving the installation bandwidth for home standby generators is a key initiative for the company in 2023. We are focused on adding more dealers, providing support for dealer recruiting, training to improve installation efficiency and developing additional technical innovations to make it easier for contractors to install our products. Recent dealer count growth has been very encouraging as we added over 500 dealers in the second half of 2022. We also rolled out our dealer talent network to help channel partners recruit qualified labor and are actively engaging with trade groups, such as the independent electrical contractors to further drive awareness for the home standby generator category among contractors. Initiatives to help dealers to streamline the installation process are also progressing well, including the launch of a universal permitting package that allows dealers to pull the necessary project documentation for their specific location. In addition, we have further expanded our field training efforts and the sharing of installation best practices for dealers and non-dealer contractors. The combination of these actions is expected to result in meaningful improvement in activation rates as the year progresses. Consistent with the comments provided in our third quarter earnings call in early November, we expect home standby sales to decline for the full year 2023 due to significant weakness in first half shipments, resulting from elevated levels of field inventory with the first quarter expected to mark the trough for shipments during the current channel destocking process. We continue to anticipate more normalized fuel inventory levels in the second half of the year based on our current view of home consultations, activations and our production rates, along with the assumption of power outage activity inline with the long term baseline average. As we ramp home standby shipments sequentially into the second half of the year, we expect home standby sales to return to solid year-over-year growth in the third and fourth quarters, even when assuming no major outage events. Favorable end market demand metrics, significant growth in our dealer counts, low nationwide penetration in the mid single digits and strengthening mega trends reinforce our confidence in the long term growth trajectory for the home standby category and also support our near term expectations for a return to growth once the home standby market reaches more normalized field inventory levels. I'd now like to provide some commentary on our residential energy technology products and solutions, as sales were inline with the low end of our prior expectations during the fourth quarter, with continued softness in residential energy storage shipments offset by strong top line performances from ecobee and Generac Grid Services. Shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems were again negatively impacted by the loss of a large customer that ceased operations in the third quarter and the overhang of the SnapRS quality related concerns. We are committed to supporting the dealers that are participating in our SnapRS warranty coverage upgrade program as well as ensuring that end customer systems are performing as intended. Channel partner response to these efforts has been favorable thus far, and we are working to build a larger and stronger network of installers and distributors, which remains a top priority for the company in 2023 as we position our residential clean energy product offering for long term success. We are investing heavily on further improving the quality and reliability of our clean energy products and view the residential storage market as a key strategic opportunity for Generac. Additionally, we are making good progress towards our next generation energy storage system and we will begin alpha testing of these products in the second quarter of this year with an anticipated launch to the market in 2024. I'd now like to provide a quick update on ecobee, which forms the core of our connected devices strategy within our residential energy ecosystem. ecobee sales continued to grow at a strong rate in the fourth quarter, despite aggressive promotional activity from competitors, which underscores the strong competitive positioning of ecobee's feature-rich solutions. In addition to their core smart thermostat product continuing to gain traction in the professional contractor channel, a number of larger utilities have been seeking out grid service partnerships with ecobee, further validating our differentiated offering. We also recently announced the integration of home standby monitoring capabilities into the ecobee platform, which allows homeowners to monitor their home standby generator and propane tank fuel levels and receive alerts directly on the ecobee platform. This marks an important first step forward in our single pane of glass initiative in developing the central user interface for our suite of residential products that will heavily leverage the ecobee platform and the development team. I also want to provide some commentary on our grid services team and their efforts as they closed out a strong year in 2022 with continued growth across key performance metrics, including connected megawatts, assets under management, number of customers and gigawatt hours of capacity delivered. The growing grid services sales pipeline is being driven by both new and existing customers as well as a wide range of connectability hardware, including the Blue Pillar acquisition, which will now provide our C&I products with connectivity capabilities to allow previously stranded C&I assets to be made available to grid services programs. In addition, grid services programs can also provide incremental economic support to the residential solar plus storage market as higher financing costs impact traditional consumer loan driven demand. Not only can these programs improve the economics for homeowners that own storage systems but we're also seeing increased opportunities to deploy grid services programs, utilizing utility and third party own systems. We believe our unique portfolio of hardware and software solutions remains a key competitive advantage within the grid services space. The long term market opportunities for residential energy storage, power conversion, energy monitoring and management services and grid services remains highly attractive and core to our strategic vision, and we will continue to target these markets and adjacent opportunities. To that end, we recently announced the launch of our new EV charger, which marks Generac's initial offering into this large and rapidly growing market. This product will be available later in 2023 through Generac’s omnichannel distribution network, including our residential dealer network, leading home improvement in hardware retailers and electrical wholesalers. We're excited to incorporate this product into our smart home energy ecosystem while continuing to pursue future EV charging innovations and capabilities. EV charging will become an increasingly important part of the energy ecosystem of the home. And as a leader in residential power, this product is a natural extension of Generac’s portfolio of energy technology solutions. Given these significant market opportunities, we continue to invest heavily in the people and processes involved in the development of these products and solutions. And this remains a key strategic area of focus for the company. We are encouraged by the progress of our new residential energy technology leadership team in integrating and improving the solutions we have acquired and developed in recent years. The investment level necessary to build a home energy technology foundation for growth will contribute to higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the company in 2023. But we anticipate strong returns on these investments well into the future as we position Generac as a leader in the deployment and integration of hardware and software solutions for home energy ecosystems. As a result of these initiatives and investments, we expect the combination of residential energy technology products and services to deliver gross sales between $300 million and $350 million for the full year 2023. We anticipate that these results will sequentially improve throughout the year, driven by strong growth from ecobee and grid services, alongside our expectations for continued improvement from our clean energy product and distribution efforts in the coming quarters. Switching gears, now I want to provide some commentary on a part of the business that has continued to outperform our expectations, as our C&I products experienced and outstanding quarter globally as sales grew by 27% as compared to the prior year, benefiting from very strong demand and higher production levels resulting from capacity expansion initiatives. Growth in shipments for domestic C&I products in the fourth quarter was highlighted by strength across all channels, including national rental equipment, telecom, industrial distributors and other strategic customers. We experienced continued strength in demand during the quarter as the backlog for our C&I products grew again sequentially, and ended the year at record levels, giving us excellent visibility into continued growth for the category in 2023. Shipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel grew significantly again in the fourth quarter, and order trends indicate growth will continue in 2023 as backlog in the channel also increased again on a sequential basis. Quoting activity and closed rates remain elevated compared to the prior year levels, highlighting our sustained market share gains as well as the durability of overall demand trends for these products. Shipments to national telecom customers also increased at a robust rate during the fourth quarter as compared to the strong prior comparison, as several of our larger national customers continue to deploy generators to harden their existing sites and build out their fifth generation of 5G networks. Investment in telecom infrastructure remains one of the key megatrends that we expect to drive growth for our C&I products in the coming years, as global tower and network hub counts further expand and the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications requires backup power for resiliency. As the leading provider of backup power to the North American telecom market, we expect to benefit from this secular trend. We also experienced another quarter of tremendous growth with our international and independent rental equipment customers as they refresh and expand their fleets. We believe the demand environment for mobile products will remain robust in the quarters ahead, as evidenced by ordered growth outpacing shipment growth in the quarter and the megatrend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements continues to play out. Additionally, we're helping these customers advance their sustainability goals with solid demand for our newly introduced mobile energy storage systems, and as we delivered the first containerized hydrogen fuel cell unit to a national rental customer through our recently announced distribution agreement with EODev. Strong customer interest for natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects also continued in the quarter as shipments of these products grew at an exceptional rate. Order rates also remain strong with our quarter end backlog for these products up substantially both year-over-year and sequentially. We believe we are in the very early innings of growth for this exciting new market opportunity as grid stability concerns and volatile energy markets are expected to further drive demand for these innovative solutions. Internationally robust momentum continued as shipments increased 22% year-over-year during the fourth quarter with 28% core total sales growth when excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Core total sales growth was driven by strength across all regions, most notably in Europe and Latin America with intersegment sales again growing substantially in the quarter as our Generac Mexico facility continued to ramp production of telecom products for the North American market. International segment EBITDA margins also increased during the quarter, primarily due to improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes. The European region has seen remarkably strong demand, most notably for C&I products and portable generators due to a heightened focus on energy independence and security. Power security concerns amid the war in Ukraine have remained and we are providing backup generators to the region through our European sales branches. Although geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions in the region remain volatile, driving less certain long term demand trends, end market awareness of the need for resiliency is undoubtedly increased across the continent. The subsequent effect of the war on Europe's energy complex has highlighted the need for reliable on site power resources for homes and businesses around the globe. We also recently announced the acquisition of REFU Storage Systems, a German developer and supplier of battery storage hardware products, advanced software and platform services for the commercial and industrial market. This acquisition represents our initial entrance into the large and rapidly growing C&I stationary energy storage market for behind the meter applications, which we view as a natural extension of our long history in the C&I backup power generation market. Given the continued momentum in the international segment, along with strong demand fundamentals and existing backlog across domestic C&I channels, we expect net sales growth for our global C&I products to be in the mid to high single digit range for 2023. In closing, this morning, we're encouraged by the initial progress and our action plans to address the near term challenges that have impacted our results over the past two quarters. We believe we have a line of sight to normalization of home standby field inventories as we rightsize our production and continue to expand our installation bandwidth. We have significantly strengthened our residential energy technology leadership team over the last six months and they are driving an increased focus on quality and innovation, while we further build out our product and distribution capabilities in this strategically important part of our business. Global interest in our C&I products and services has never been stronger, and is well positioned to continue growing in 2023. We remain confident in the long term strategic growth themes within our business, including the still significant penetration opportunity for home standby generators and the rapidly developing market for energy storage. The previously discussed megatrends that support these growth themes have never been more evident. Our refined focus on execution through our portfolio of backup power and energy technology solutions has uniquely positioned us to create value in the transition to the next generation grid. I'm extremely confident in our team's ability to continue developing innovative products and services as we execute on our mission to lead the evolution to more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions. I'll now turn the call over to York to provide further details on the fourth quarter as well as full year 2022 results and our outlook for 2023. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter 2022 results in more detail. Net sales decreased 2% to $1.05 billion during the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to $1.07 billion in the prior year fourth quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 5% favorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Net sales for the full year 2022 increased 22% to approximately $4.56 billion, an all-time record for the company. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class. Residential product sales declined 19% to $575 million as compared to $706 million in the prior year. A partial quarter of contribution from the ecobee acquisition and the slight unfavorable impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 4% of revenue growth for the quarter on a net basis. Lower shipments of home standby generators and weakness in PWRcell energy storage systems drove the decline in residential product core sales growth. Commercial and industrial product sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 27% to $361 million as compared to $284 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from the Electronic Environments and Blue Pillar acquisitions were fully offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency during the quarter. The very strong core sales growth was broad based across all regions internationally and all channels domestically, with particular strength in national rental equipment, telecom, industrial distributors and other direct customers for beyond standby applications. Net sales for other products and services increased 46% to $113 million as compared to $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Contributions from the Electronic Environments and ecobee acquisitions contributed approximately 34% of this growth, given their additional service capabilities. Core sales growth for the category was 13% due to strong growth in our services offerings in certain parts of our business, both domestically and internationally, along with continued growth in aftermarket service parts and extended warranty revenue recognition. Gross profit margin was 32.7% compared to 34% in the prior year fourth quarter as unfavorable sales mix had a meaningful negative impact during the quarter. This was partially offset by the realization of previously implemented pricing actions. Operating expenses increased $49 million or 26% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily driven by higher recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions and unfavorable adjustment for acquisition contingent consideration, certain legal and regulatory reserves, higher intangible amortization expense and increased employee and marketing costs. These increases were partially offset by lower acquisition related transaction costs in the current year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $174 million or 16.6% of net sales in the fourth quarter as compared to $220 million or 20.7% of net sales in the prior year. For the full year 2022, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $825 million or an 18.1% margin as compared to $861 million or 23.1% margin in the prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, decreased 3% to $881 million in the quarter as compared to $909 million in the prior year, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 7% revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $144 million, representing a 16.4% margin as compared to $197 million in the prior year or 21.6% of total sales. The lower domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by the realization of previously implemented pricing actions. In addition, the impact of acquisitions and continued energy technology operating expense investments for future growth negatively affected margins during the quarter. For the full year 2022, Domestic segment total sales increased 23% over the prior year to $3.93 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 18.2% compared to 24.8% in the prior year full year. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 22% to $219 million in the quarter as compared to $180 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 28% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $29.5 million or 13.5% of net sales as compared to $23.7 million or 13.1% of net sales in the prior year. This margin performance was driven primarily by improved operating leverage on the higher volumes. For the full year 2022, International segment total sales increased 32% over the prior year to $791 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests were 13.8% of total sales during 2022, a significant 280 basis point increase compared to the 11% margin in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of '22 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $71 million as compared to $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The current year net income includes pretax charges totaling approximately $21 million related to an unfavorable adjustment for acquisition contingent consideration and certain legal and regulatory reserves. In addition, interest expense increased approximately $10 million compared to the prior year due to higher borrowings and higher interest rates. GAAP income taxes during the current year fourth quarter were $13.6 million or an effective tax rate of 15.5% as compared to $20.6 million or an effective tax rate of 12.4% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was due to certain favorable discrete items that were reflected in the prior year, which did not repeat in the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.83 in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $2.04 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $113 million in the current year quarter or $1.78 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $160 million in the prior year or $2.51 per share. Cash flow from operations was $101 million as compared to $62 million in the prior year fourth quarter and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $80 million as compared to $42 million in the same quarter last year. The improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to lower working capital investment in the current year quarter as we reduced our material receipts and production rates for home standby generators. This was partially offset by lower operating earnings. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.29 billion of liquidity, comprised of approximately $133 million of cash on hand and $1.16 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.43 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter of 1.8 times on an as-reported basis. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $222 million or an average price of approximately $102 per share. There is approximately $278 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of 2022. With that, I will now provide further comments on our new outlook for 2023. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we're initiating 2023 net sales guidance that is consistent with the high level comments provided in our third quarter earnings call on November 2nd. As Aaron previously discussed, shipments of residential products are expected to face significant headwinds in the first half of the year due to elevated field inventory levels for home standby generators and the continued build out of our clean energy product and distribution capabilities. We expect the residential product category to return to year-over-year sales growth in the second half, resulting in a full year decline in the high teens range compared to prior year. We anticipate continued growth for C&I product sales across several channels domestically and internationally, resulting in expected C&I net sales growth in the mid to high single digit range for the full year with higher growth rates anticipated in the first half of the year. As a result of these factors, we expect overall net sales for the full year to decrease between minus 6% to minus 10% as compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 1% of net favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the year in line with the longer term baseline average. As a result and consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year, such as a Category 3 or higher landed hurricane or major winter storm. As a result of this top line outlook, we expect sales to be more weighted to the back half of the year for 2023, similar to pre-COVID periods, which did not include substantial residential backlog, with overall net sales in the first half being approximately 44% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 56% weighted. Specifically, with the return to normal seasonality and the destocking of home standby field inventory, we expect first quarter total sales to decline by approximately minus 25% to minus 26% from the prior year with growth in C&I product sales more than offset by residential product headwinds. Looking at our gross margin expectations for the full year 2023 compared to 2022, we expect favorable price cost impacts driven by previously implemented pricing actions that have not yet fully annualized, certain cost reduction initiatives and lower input costs to more than offset the negative impact of unfavorable sales mix resulting from lower home standby generator shipments. As a result, we expect gross margins for the full year to increase by approximately 150 basis points as compared to 2022. From a seasonality perspective, we expect first quarter gross margins to be the lowest during the year due primarily to the outsized impact of unfavorable sales mix and lower overhead absorption on the lower home standby volumes. Specifically for the first quarter, we expect gross margins to be approximately 200 basis points below the first quarter of 2022. Sequential quarterly improvements in gross margins are expected as the year progresses due to improved sales mix from higher shipments of home standby generators, along with lower input costs, improved overhead absorption and realization of cost reduction initiatives as we move throughout the year. And as a result, gross margins are expected to progressively improve with fourth quarter margins to be approximately 500 basis points higher than fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, we continue to focus heavily on supporting innovation, executing on strategic initiatives and driving future revenue growth in new and existing markets. As a result of these continued investments, we expect operating expenses, excluding intangible amortization expense as a percentage of net sales to be nearly 20% for the full year of 2023, with operating leverage improving throughout the year. As a result of our gross margin and operating expense expectations, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are expected to be approximately 17% to 18% for the full year compared to the 18.1% reported for the full year 2022. From a seasonality perspective, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to improve significantly as we move throughout the year, primarily driven by the sequentially improving gross margins as previously discussed in detail and to a lesser extent, improved leverage of operating expenses on the expected higher sales volumes in the second half of 2023. Specifically regarding the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be the lowest for the year at approximately 10% and then improve sequentially throughout the year, returning to more normalized levels in the low 20% range in the fourth quarter. As a result, second half adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 800 basis points higher than the first half margins. As is normal practice, we are also providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2023. For 2023, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 24% to 25% as compared to the 19.6% full year GAAP tax rate for 2022. This increase is driven primarily by expectations for lower share based compensation deductions, increased mix of income in higher tax jurisdictions and higher tax on foreign income in 2023 compared to 2022. Additionally, to arrive at appropriate estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, the related reconciling item should be forecasted net of tax using this GAAP tax rate as well. We expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million, assuming no additional term loan principal prepayments during the year and assuming elevated SOFR rates throughout 2023. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately 2.5% to 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year in line with historical levels. Depreciation expense is forecast to be approximately $56 million to $58 million in 2023, given our assumed CapEx guidance. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2023 is expected to be approximately $100 million during the year, and stock compensation expense is expected to be between $40 million to $43 million for the year. Operating and free cash flow generation is expected to follow historical seasonality of being disproportionately weighted towards the second half of the year in 2023. Specifically related to the first quarter, we expect free cash flow to be negative, assuming a continued use of cash for working capital with a sharp recovery in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion to be strong at well over 100% as recent trends of significant working capital builds are reversed. Our full year weighted average diluted share count is expected to decrease to approximately 63 million shares as compared to 64.7 million shares in 2022, which reflects the share repurchases that were completed in 2022. Finally, the 2023 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tommy Moll from Stephens.
Tommy Moll: Aaron, I appreciated your comments and insight on the field inventory levels for home standby. I think what I heard you say was in terms of days on hand, it was down sequentially, but well above normal. So my related follow-on question is, is there any way you can frame quantitatively or qualitatively what normal looks like? And to what extent do you need to continue to build out the dealer network in order to achieve that level in the back half of this year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Obviously, the field inventory destocking process that we're going through, there's a lot of metrics there that we have at our fingertips in terms of how much inventory is in the field, you know activation rates. You can look at them as we do on a seasonal basis, The comments, as you indicated, you were spot on, we said that from a days of field inventory standpoint, they improved sequentially from the fourth quarter, but still high. I think if you go back to our comments on the last call in November, we said we were about double. We thought field inventory levels were about double where they needed to be from a normal kind of, quote unquote, normal level. We're better than that today. So the raw numbers are, we're about 20% off the peak in terms of just raw units in field inventory, home standby units, which is great. And as that days of field inventory also coming down sequentially, the combination of those two things, reducing production rates, the activation rate was up nicely in the fourth quarter. So we continue to see installation building out. So all of those metrics are favorable. And point two, the destocking event that's going on. But as our prepared remarks indicated, still high relative to where they need to be normally. So it's not quite double. It's less than that, maybe, I don't know, 1.6 times, 1.7 times still the level in terms of just the raw numbers as we look at them, but coming down nicely. In terms of the second part of the question, there's a -- it's kind of a -- it's a multipart -- multipronged approach, if you will. The biggest of which, as we've indicated and I think you're latched on to as well, is that we have to increase the raw dealer count. And so to that end, we added over 500 dealers on a net basis in the second half of the year, which is the strongest second half of a year we've ever had in terms of new dealer ads at 8,700, we ended the year actually over 8,700 dealers and progressing very nicely there in terms of broadening our our reach, also focused on training. I think one of the things we mentioned with the pandemic over the last several years, we had very aggressive training -- face-to-face training programs. Pre-pandemic, we had to scale those back during the pandemic, we just weren't able to do that. And we're back to training now face-to-face with dealers, with contractors, and that is super helpful in terms of the engagement level with those partners. Another area is helping them find labor. One of the big things that we heard in the second half of last year was the labor constraints that our dealers have and our contractor partners have in being able to expand their installation capacity is just headcount, just people. And so we created something we call the dealer talent network and we've rolled that out here early in 2023. And we're getting good traction there in helping dealers find and hire and onboard the talent they need to increase their installation capacity. So all of those things together -- and then longer term, we have some technical solutions we're working on, obviously, trying to take labor out of the actual installation process is a big part of this as well. So all of those efforts, we think that certainly on the shorter term efforts like adding distribution, training and helping dealers find qualified headcount, we're making really good progress on those short term initiatives. And then longer term, on the innovation side, we see and have a number of really good kind of ideas around how we can continue to take labor out of the home standby installation process. So I think we're making good progress. We see the metrics reflecting that in a lower field inventory level, but we're still going to see that kind of exist here through the first half. And we own that. We know that's going to result in pressure on the first half of the year. And because of the margin profile of those products, in particular, as you heard York's remarks around the outlook, it's going to be kind of a tale of two halves. Seasonally, top line is going to be relatively similar, 44% being the first half, 56% being the back half. But I think profitability, because of the heavy mix shift, you're going to see that play out in that 800 basis point move from Q1 to Q4 in EBITDA margins that we’re -- in gross margin, that we're anticipating over the course of the year. But great question and obviously a central focus, not only for us but others as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Halloran from Baird.
Michael Halloran: So just a follow up on that, Aaron. Maybe you can just talk about what your assumptions are for the underlying demand dynamics as you work through the back half of the year? In other words, it sounds like you think that the current strength that you're seeing in home consultations and some of those megatrends you mentioned. It sounds like you think that carries through the year into the back half of the year. Just some thoughts on what's underpinning that back half strength from an underlying demand perspective, kind of ignoring that inventory normalization side that you've talked about?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Mike, I think there's -- optically, I think when you look at first half, second half, right, like I think it looks like, wow, that's a really big hill to climb. Again, seasonally, interestingly enough, you get kind of normal seasonality, you go back to 2019 levels, and actually pre-2019, just looking back, we're really not that far off of how the top line would pace seasonally. But we've got this, what I'll call, kind of artificially low. We're referring to it as an air pocket with home standby because of the destocking event. But to answer your question, what gives us confidence that the year will play out, at least the underpinned -- what's underpinning the demand metrics that we're seeing and how we're building out our view on the full year. So there's a couple of things. One is you look at the fourth quarter IHC levels. That was a record fourth quarter for us, it matched the fourth quarter of the prior year. So that was a record. And so they're both records in terms of IHC flow. So we're seeing really strong sales lead volume. And that has continued here in 2023, as we said, January was an all-time record for us for January. Best January we've ever had with IHCs. So we're really encouraged by the continued focus by homeowners. Look, I think that what is -- maybe there's a lot of noise in the story right now with the destocking and everything else that some of the clean energy challenges that we've had, we're talking about. But what's not -- which shouldn't be lost on people is the fact that power outages are happening and people are concerned about resiliency. Grid operators are very concerned about their ability to supply power on a normal basis, like forget weather for a second. But just with kind of the way that the grid is changing, as we electrify everything on the demand side and on the source side, on the power generation side, the addition of all these renewable sources, these mandates to increase renewable sources, and those are intermittent sources, that's driving supply and demand challenges for grid operators and utilities like they've never seen before. And so their ability to solve for those challenges is a huge focal point. And you can just see what's happening, right? I mean, look at the holiday outages that we saw in the Carolinas and in areas along the East Coast, where there were rolling blackouts because of the demand from electric heating, residential heating and the cold weather taking power plants and supply offline. So -- and Austin, we had the ice storm here recently as well, another 400,000 homes that were without power there. So power outages and the concern on power outage is front and center for homeowners. So we're seeing that come through in our sales lead volume. We're also seeing, as part of our metrics here and what we're -- the assumptions that we're making to answer your question, we're assuming a higher close rate. Why are we assuming that because we're seeing that. And we're coming off of kind of the lows. We're about 20% higher on close rates today than we were a year ago, which is really encouraging. Now they're not back to pre-pandemic levels yet, but they're improving, that's the opportunity. So we see improving close rates. We see higher sales lead volume. We've got the distribution adds. This is another really important part of the story. I mean we added 500 new dealers on a net basis in the second half of the year. This is how -- we've always talked about this business kind of being a step function grower and we have these periods of elevated growth and then things kind of level off and you kind of come down off the peaks, and you level off into what we refer to and have referred to historically as a new and higher baseline level of demand. And that's really what we're targeting in the second half of the year is that normalization, if you will, of that baseline demand, right, the presentation of that and then the field inventories, that destocking process being completed here by the first half of the year. So you put all that together and package it up and then obviously you surround all that with continued strength in our C&I business, which has been great. We probably don't talk enough about that, but a fantastic property that we've built over the last 15 years here that's been a great way to help us diversify this business and has given us exposure to some awesome megatrends around telecom and some of the infrastructure rebuild type of efforts that are going on, not only domestically here but globally. So we put all of that together and that's what really gives us confidence in kind of this first half, second half story.
York Ragen: And I know that there's a lot of discussion on hard landing, soft landing recession, whatever it may be. And I think to Aaron's point then as long as there's power outages, we've historically tended to decouple from that economic environment as long as it power outages. So that's -- put it back to full circle to what -- how Aaron started the answer to that question.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Markets.
Jeff Hammond: So just want to go through the -- one, just the bridge on the margins, first half to second half, and how you get there. And I guess on a full year basis, it seems like EBITDA margins are kind of flattish to slightly down. And just given the revenue decline and the mix change, given home standbys under more in pressure, just some of the moving pieces on how to kind of hold those margins flat?
York Ragen: So speaking to EBITDA margins. So we mentioned Q1 would be in that 10% range. The double hit of the destock, coupled with a tough comp from the prior year, but looking at 10% EBITDA for Q1. Talked about Q4, building out through the year to Q4 being in that low 20% range. So you're right, that's an abnormally larger EBITDA range progressing through the year. But I think given some of the things that Aaron talked about, that's the rationale for it. And when you look at a lot of the pieces, I mean, half of that growth just alone half of that growth, as home standby recovers in the back half, you'll get a better mix in Q4 than you did in Q1 of home standby. You'll get a tremendous amount of operating leverage then on the higher volumes. So I would say just half of the margin recovery is just better mix and operating leverage on the higher home standby volumes. And then the other half is really a story on cost. So we're currently realizing on a leg basis, we're still realizing higher input costs, higher commodity costs, higher logistics costs, because there's legs to get through our supply chain and legs to get through our inventory levels in terms of realizing our input costs. So when you model it out, we expect as we get through Q4 relative to Q1, we'll have lower commodities, we'll have lower electronic surcharges that we've been incurring all throughout 2022, lower logistics costs, the better manufacturing overhead absorption as we ramp up productions. And then we always have our profitability enhancement programs that we're working on every year that are focused on cost reductions of the bill of material of our products, focused cost reductions, cross functional initiatives, things like that. So on the cost side, that's the other half of the puzzle. And we feel confident as we work through the legs, we'll see better margins relative as a result of better input costs.
Operator: And our next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Christopher, is your line on mute, please unmute. And our next question comes from Mark Strouse from JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse: I wanted to turn to the Clean Power business. I apologize if I missed this. Did you say what that revenue number was in '22, and then how should we think about that range kind of heading into 2023? And then I'm kind of also curious, I know you've got a lot of things going on that are company specific. How are you thinking about kind of the macro environment for that business in particular? Just hearing some kind of mixed commentary from some of the other companies in the space.
York Ragen: So that energy technology business, which includes the Clean Energy, PWRcell energy storage business, our ecobee connected devices business and grid services business, that was around $300 million for the year. And I think in Aaron's prepared remarks, we expect that same energy technology business to be around $300 million to $350 million for 2023.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And then from a macro standpoint, Mark, the way we see this space, obviously, we're in this for the long run. And so from a macro environment standpoint, I think there's a number of forecasts out there they're calling for residential solar to maybe be down in '23. And there's a couple of reasons for that, obviously, higher interest rates. As part of that story, another part of that story, would be some of the changes that are ongoing kind of at the state level, you look at like California with NEM 3.0 and the impact that, that can have on the pace of solar penetration rates, I would say, that's largely -- there's a view that that's largely offset by some of the federal stimulus that the IRA Act is providing. So we remain bullish that while growth maybe isn't going to be huge, as York said, between $300 million and $350 million, which is a little bit of growth over the prior year. But we are seeing, at least within our network for the Clean Energy side, again, we've got some specific company challenges, as you mentioned, that we're working through. But on our connected devices businesses, specifically ecobee, seen really nice growth in that business as well as grid services, like we mentioned in our prepared remarks this morning. So that all kind of goes under this umbrella that we refer to as residential energy technology, put together the Clean Energy devices, connected devices and grid services. So not tremendous growth in '23 but we see the opportunity for that business long term. It's an important strategic part of what we need to build out, and we're going to be successful there longer term.
Operator: And for our next question, we have Brian Drab with William Blair.
Brian Drab: I was wondering if you could just elaborate on the EV charging opportunity. Can you say anything about what you think the revenue opportunity might be there longer term, and are you essentially leveraging the PWRcell technology to build that product?
Aaron Jagdfeld: We're really excited about this. We're the first generation product, I'll call it, that we're launching this year is more of a standard level two charger that we'll have in the market by later this year. We really want to get something in the hands of our distribution partners, in particular, our dealer partners who are starting to see more opportunities for EV charger implementation. The team is really focused -- longer term, we believe there's some innovation there. As you kind of indicate, the current architecture we have with our PWRcell system, the rebus architecture, as we refer to it, that we have, we think there's a great opportunity to do more with EV charging and really to separate ourselves from a technical standpoint longer term. That won't be the initial product. But the initial product is going to, again, get us in the space. We do think there's some opportunities around the initial product to help homeowners manage the different loads in their homes so that they can maybe avoid a costly upgrade of their electrical system. One of the things that many homeowners are confronting as they look at an EV charger, look at buying an EV is it's not just that they have to install the charger, which can cost $1,000, $1,500, but they also have to oftentimes upgrade their electrical system, because their panel is either deficient in the amount of power that it can supply or perhaps it's not up to code. So in fact, some of the installation partners are telling us that 60% of the time when they're installing a charger, they have to do some major electrical work around upgrading the panel. We think there's an opportunity with some of our PWRmanager technology to help homeowners manage some of the heavier loads and avoid some of those more expensive panel upgrades and electrical upgrades. So that's going to be part of our value proposition around EV charging initially here. And then longer term, we think there's some pretty exciting things perhaps around bidirectional charging. As that market matures, we think we can really add some value there for homeowners. In particular, when you think of the EV charger in the context of one component in the broader home energy ecosystem, we think that that's going to be at the very large load for the home and being able to control that load, both from an efficiency standpoint as well as a cost standpoint, it's going to be super critical to how homes manage their overall energy generation, their storage and all of their resiliency efforts as well longer term.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Aaron, I'm wondering if you could just expand on the comments regarding 20% decline in field inventory. So in the 10-Q, you folks disclosed $220 million of dealer financing guarantees on inventories. So is that 20% applied to that $220 million? In other words, are you under shipping end demand by $40 million in the fourth quarter, or is that a subset of the overall dealer inventory picture that you look at?
York Ragen: So yes, that disclosure that you're speaking to on the field, the floor plan financing program is just a subset of our field inventory that…
Aaron Jagdfeld: Field inventory is across all channels, right…
York Ragen: All channels...
Aaron Jagdfeld: e-commerce partners…
York Ragen: And not everybody, and even the dealers not everybody uses the field floor plan financing. So it's subset. It is improving that number off the peaks. So again, if you just look at raw units across the entire subset based on the information we track with all the data we have, just raw units were down 20% from peak levels from earlier this year -- earlier in middle part of 2022.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joseph Osha from Guggenheim.
Joseph Osha: Just penciling through what you said so far and looking at the -- in particular, how residential energy tech is trending. It looks to me like somewhere around Q3 for this to work you need your HSB business to see a 30% or so sequential increase Q2 to Q3, or is that [Technical Difficulty] of the whole year guidance?
York Ragen: Well, you definitely would need -- you will definitely see a sequential -- a larger than normal sequential increase from Q2 to Q3 in home standby, just because you won't have the field inventory overhang. And so that's an artificial reduction in the first half…
Aaron Jagdfeld: And then there's some normal seasonality that takes place.
York Ragen: Yes, you had normal seasonality…
Aaron Jagdfeld: Right. The season for home standby generators typically picks up in the third and fourth quarter.
York Ragen: You would expect to see a sizable increase in home standby if that's what you're interpreting from our comments, yes.
Operator: And our next question comes from Donovan Schafer from Northland Capital Markets.
Donovan Schafer: I'd like to take a moment and just ask something a bit kind of maybe a higher level or not as maybe a near term quarter to quarter issue. But in the last couple of years with how much -- it kind of feels like the home standby market itself has changed just with how much growth there's been with the COVID demand and everything. I'm wondering if you can give us an update on kind of the competitive landscape there. Of course, rising tide lifts all boats, so everyone can be doing well. But for a long time, you've talked about having the 75% market share. I'm curious if you still -- if your sense is still that, that's kind of where you are today, about 75% market share with home standby or if there are there any changes there, is that is incrementally moving higher or lower even while everything rises? Or if you don't have that in particular, are you seeing competitors make any move saying, hey, this is getting to be a really big market, you purchase and own your own copper winding equipment because of the scale that you have, but if the whole market is growing, are you aware of like competitors making moves like that, buying their own copper lining equipment? Anything like that kind of just higher level update on the competitive dynamics in the home standby market.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, it's a great question, Donovan. I mean we don't talk too much about that. And we probably -- it's a good checkpoint. I would tell you that we believe our share is probably north of that 75%. We've probably grown over the last few years, a little bit probably more outsized. You're right though that a rising tide raises all boats there. And I think our competitors are -- first of all, the competitive set is the same and it's been the same for almost 20 years in the category, which is interesting to me. And the two other competitors that play in that space, it's a much smaller part of their business, right? Like their businesses, their core businesses or other things. So for those competitors, the power -- the home standby generators in particular are a tertiary or even further down the pole kind of product line for them. So in terms of their focus, right, just raw focus on the products, the development, we still are the only product in the market that has connectivity out of the box, right? So that we give homeowners, every homeowner who buys a home standby today can get updates on the status of their generator through Mobile Link, which is our app or now they can get through the ecobee platform, which is awesome. We just rolled that out as part of our ecosystem. Those types of things, our competitors don't have that, and that's I think one of the beautiful things about scale. And you pointed out that the advantages of that on the manufacturing side, right, our ability to invest heavily in the machine tooling and the capabilities we need to continue to drive the kind of -- not only the capacity that we need right to grow the market, which is where we struggled over the last few years until recently is getting capacity to increase at the rate of the increase in the market, but also the scale extends beyond just manufacturing, right? Our ability to invest in driving sales leads. I mean we are spending tens of millions of dollars advertising to drive sales leads. The platform, PowerPlay, which is our sales -- selling platform, that's a unique platform in the marketplace. Our ability to recruit distribution, right, and to put the kind of focus on that effort. Again, if you're a smaller player in this market and for somebody that -- if you're mid single digit kind of market share or 10% share, and it's a small part of your business, too, you have to think about the context of making a business decision about investing to that level. Even though it's a good market, I think that's a difficult decision to make if you're some of our competitors. So we're trying to use our scale to continue to grow and to continue to do, I think, things that lead the industry. We've done that for two decades or more, and we're going to continue to do that in terms of leaning in to things like connectivity, things like the next generation home standby generator, which we haven't talked much about, but we've got some really exciting product developments there that we'll talk about as the year progresses here. But that's the kind of thing that I think once we get -- once you unpack that, you look at what scale gets you, it's just one of those things where we've got that flywheel spinning very, very fast right now, and we continue to invest heavily in it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi from Credit Suisse.
Maheep Mandloi: Firstly, I just want to check if -- do you assume any price reductions for the home standby generators in the guidance? And second question on the online channels versus your dealer and distributors. Could you just talk about that dynamic, what the share is and if you're seeing a growth in online versus dealers, and how is that impacting the relationship with your traditional channels?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So I think I'll deal with it. From a share perspective, we don't break down the channel share. But our dealer channel is our biggest channel, it's a really important channel. Obviously, they do -- obviously, the lion's share of installations in the network that's not restricted just to dealers. I mean, if you're an electrical contractor, you can do installations as well and you have access to the product through an electrical wholesale channel, if you want to buy, but maybe you don't want to commit to the level that you need to commit to, to be a dealer, right, to carry inventory, to supply service and to do the work there to be a dealer. It's a different level. Our e-commerce partners are also an important channel, though, and have been for some time. It's a great way for homeowners who -- if they find they want to project manage this on their own, right, hire their own electrical contractor or plumber to do the work, there might be a way for them to save a few dollars that way, but it's a little more work, right? A dealer provides a turnkey solution for most homeowners. And what we're finding is as the category matures, dealer share has grown faster than other channel share, because more people who get into the category really want a turnkey solution. So dealers will pull the permit, they'll do all the work that's needed to make that a seamless project for the homeowner. As far as pricing, your question on pricing, really, all we've built into the guide this year, and I think we've called this out, that's a higher level of promotion, as you would expect, as the category starts to normalize in terms to get to that new and higher level, baseline level. We would expect a higher level of promotion. There's been very little in the way of promotion over the last several years. So when you think about price on a net basis, I would say there's some of that net price built in, there's probably less price this year, a lower price this year on a net basis than prior year simply because of increased discounts.
York Ragen: Now that we've caught the backlog when you're in a position of backlog, you don't promote as much. But there's a normal cadence of promotion every year when you're not in backlog, and we'll revert back to that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kashy Harrison from Piper Sandler.
Kashy Harrison: So core sales in the C&I business in Q4 was about 27%, it sounds like, and I think maybe 30% for the full year. You're indicating you have a record backlog and you're seeing strength across all segments. And so I was wondering if you could maybe speak to the durability of demand in C&I over a multiyear time period? And then maybe just provide some color as to why C&I revs are only up in the mid to high single digits just given what you saw in Q4 and in 2022?
Aaron Jagdfeld: The C&I business, we said in the prepared remarks, but it continues to outperform our expectations. They had a fantastic Q4. And so the durability of the demand, that is a lead time business, right, I think we've talked about this in the past. Our residential business, in particular, the home standby business has not traditionally been a backlog business or a lead time business, even though it got to that position through the outsized demand that was happening over the last several years. But C&I has always been kind of a business, you look at book-to-bill, and we see record levels of backlog in that business as we exit 2022. And that's both domestically as well as internationally. And so that gives us confidence and, frankly, really good visibility into the year here. I would say that within the C&I business, there's a couple of big pieces of that, though, that where maybe visibility is less so and maybe kind of leads to why we're saying mid to high single-digit growth for the year. The growth cycles for telecom and for our mobile equipment, which are generally sold through the larger national rental account customers can be a bit lumpy from time to time. They can turn the CapEx spending on and off quite quickly. And so we have some visibility based on forecasts, you can listen to -- as we do when we dialog with our national rental account customers, we listen to their guides on CapEx spending for the upcoming year. And they're all, by enlarge, kind of forecasting similar levels to last year, if not greater levels based on the company. And our telecom customers are also telling us they're continuing to build out their networks, harden their networks, they're focused on building out 5G. But look, we've been down this road before and we're also -- we're cognizant of the fact that things can happen and they can turn the CapEx spending off quickly. So I think we're positioning a bit to say we have less visibility around telecom and national rental accounts versus some of our distributor business, both kind of internationally and domestically here, where we have very good backlog and very good visibility, and put all that together and we also have some tougher comps in the second half of the year. Q4 was really, really heavy. And so kind of coming up against that tougher comp in the second half of the year, we're just -- that kind of manifests itself, I think, in a lower growth rate. So I think you put all that together, I think kind of mid to high single digit growth still feels kind of appropriate right now at this kind of stage of the cycle, but we're watching it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish: I wanted to go back to HSB and the guidance for the large increase in the second half. I guess I'm just wondering how much improvement in installation capacity would you need to see over the course of the year to achieve that growth? And could you get there based on the current pace of installation capacity growth over the last few quarters, or would you need to kind of see a more pronounced growth in installation capacity to support your revenue guidance for the second half?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So it's a great question and fundamental, obviously, to how we think about the ability to hit these targets in the second half. We do need installation bandwidth to continue to expand and grow. Now we grew very nicely last year and ended the year very strong in Q4. You've got normal seasonality that happens there. You get into the winter months here, the depths of the winter months. And as we would expect activations are down versus fourth quarter, because that's kind of pacing we normally see, right? It's really hard to install product when there's a foot of snow on the ground or there's still frost in the ground in the Northeast, the Midwest, in other areas of the country like that. But to answer your question directly, we do have built into the model that there has to be an increase yet in installation bandwidth. Now we added 500 new dealers in the back half of the year, that's going to help a lot and we're going to continue to add dealers and focus on expanding distribution here throughout 2023 to pace towards that higher activation rate that we're going to need by the time we exit 2023. But I will say this, it's not the kind of increase like looking back, it's not the kind of increase we would have needed at this point last year. If we had probably been kind of -- I think we're more optimistic that the channel was going to respond favorably to our increase in capacity output at the factory, we felt that they were going to increase their installation capacity at the same -- commensurate with that pace. And if you kind of stood back and looked at that, today, it's like, wow, okay, that's really large. The question you're asking, that's a really large increase last year. This year, it's not nearly the size increase year-over-year, because we've made really good progress. And in Q4, we made really good progress as well on increasing activation. So it's a smaller kind of hill to climb than if you compare it to the prior year, it was a much bigger hill to climb. And again, looking back on that and now kind of fully understanding the challenges that distribution had in adding the labor they needed and doing all the things that they needed to do to respond on a commensurate basis with our capacity increases, that was really the fundamental problem we ran into in kind of running well past them in terms of shipments. So that I think we feel better about where we're at today as we think about that hill we have to climb, but there is still an increase needed as we exit 2023.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Gianarikas from Canaccord Genuity.
George Gianarikas: Mine was a little longer term in nature. I know that the company's margins have deleveraged this year. But I'm wondering if there's anything structural over the long term that will hinder you from getting back to EBITDA margins in the low to mid-20s?
York Ragen: Just even thinking about our Q4 guide, so for Q4 2023, we're guiding to get back to those low 20% range, at least for that seasonal time period. So when you think about '24 and '25, we think we're well on our way to getting back to those levels on a full year basis. And I think with some continued growth and continued leverage, in particular, on the energy technology side, where we'll continue to grow that business and go from investment mode to -- and start-up mode to growth mode and profitability mode, that will definitely help improve the overall company's profitability in '24 and '25.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And I think just on that point, York is right. I mean, we kind of alluded to it in the prepared remarks this morning, but we're investing heavily in that part of the business. And the growth rates are not there right now. They were -- we ran into our challenges, obviously, well documented here. And so we've got a lot of work to do around that. But I think the takeaway this morning for everybody is we're not pivoting away from it. We're going to continue to invest in it. We've brought in new leadership and strengthening that team, which is I think a really critical part of kind of our turnaround efforts, I'll just call it, what it is there when it comes to certain of those products in the energy tech space, we have work to do. And it's proving to be more difficult and it's going to prove to be more costly than we originally anticipated. But we still think that it's worth the effort. This is an area where, again, the macro environment favors this based on everything we've talked about this morning, based on everything that is known out there in the marketplace. We think we have every right to play here. We think we have to execute better. And to execute better, we're going to have to spend more money, and we're going to have to spend more time, and we're going to have to do things the right way going forward. And that's -- we own that, and we've addressed it. I feel really good about what we've done, the changes we've made in that business over the last six months. But it is still going to be a significant drag on kind of our EBITDA margins at least here in 2023, but that should relax as we go forward and we start to kind of recover in parts of that business. And we see the continued growth in other parts of that business, like the ecobee pieces as well as grid services. So longer term, we are absolutely committed to it and we're going to be successful there. If people think that this has scared us off or this is going to turn us away from it, they don't know us, they don't know me. We're definitely going to go after this business. We have every right to play and hear in every right to win here, and we're going to do that. It's just going to take more time and it's going to be a heavier investment than we had originally calibrated around.
Operator: And our next question comes from Henry Roberts from Truist Securities.
Jordan Levy: This is Jordan Levy from Truist Securities. On the energy technology business, I just wanted to see if we could get some more insight into how you're thinking about the recovery of PWRcell as we moved through the year and regaining some of the ground that was lost there this year in terms of your guidance of $300 million to $350 million for the year for the entire segment?
Aaron Jagdfeld: That PWRcell business is exactly what I was talking about in the previous question. And we've got -- basically, that's going to sequentially improve throughout the year. That's kind of how we're kind of viewing our expectations for the year. We're coming off of a pretty low base just in terms of where we're at because of the loss of that major customer in the third quarter last year. We've got to rebuild and build a stronger distribution network for those products and we've got to recover confidence from the market in general in those products. We're having those conversations. We're making the right improvements to the product and have been making that over the back half of this year. Now we've got to get back to selling. We've got to get back to engaging with the channel and building out and finding new distribution partners to work with on that. I think what's really exciting about that and not trying to turn it into a 2024 story. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have our next generation of our storage device that is going to alpha testing here. We'll start shipping that in Q2, and we'll hopefully expand that to beta testing throughout the back half of this year. But I've seen some prototypes of it, and our team, we've got -- again, we've got a very different technical team that's working on that product today than what was working on the original kind of what we refer to as our R1 product, the acquired product from Pika Energy, which we've worked to improve and harden. But we're looking forward to the next-generation device. And we're very excited about what that device is going to be able to do in the market. I don't want to kind of ruin the surprise for everybody at this point. But I think as we pace throughout here, throughout 2023, we'll be able to give you some more commentary around how it's going. We're going to do a lot of extended field testing, obviously, in that product to make sure it's ready for prime time when we get to it next year. But the team is very encouraged. And again, I think it fits well with my previous comments on how important we see residential energy storage being for the future. It's an incredibly important product category, especially in light of things like NEM 3.0 in California, really to make the economics work for solar in California today, you got to add a storage device. And frankly, homeowners want that anyway, because they want the resiliency, they want the ability to improve the payback on that solar investment and they're going to need storage. And so we're very focused on that. We're very focused on what the supply chain changes are going to need to be around not only the batteries, the packs and the other components here as the Inflation Reduction Act really kind of starts to take hold and you get these production tax credit opportunities for domestic manufacturing or North American manufacturing, as that becomes clearer, we'll start to also really have that reflected in our supply chain for those products. So there's a lot of work to be done there. I think it maybe goes hand-in-hand with my comments a minute ago around the investment level needed to be successful here, even though PWRcell itself we've got recovery to do there. And I think we're going to be okay as we go out throughout this year. We're still investing heavily in next generation products and where we're going for the future.

I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter was in line with the preliminary results we announced on October 19. Momentum in the commercial and industrial product category remains strong. The residential product sales while still growing compared with the prior year were weaker than expected in the quarter driven by lower shipments of home standby generators, and clean energy products relative to our prior expectations.  Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 15% to $1.09 billion, primarily driven by core sales growth of 10%, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency. Overall residential product sales grew 9% during the quarter led by sales of home standby generators and the impact from recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems. C&I product sales increased 20% led by growth across all channels domestically, strength in the European region, and the contribution from recent acquisitions.  Now discussing our third quarter results in more detail, home standby generator sales grew at a mid-teens rate over the prior year. Baseline power outage activity in the U.S. during the quarter remained above the long-term baseline average and Hurricane Ian, which occurred in the last week of the quarter drove total power outage activity well above the long-term average. Home consultations or sales leads were lower in the quarter when compared to the prior year, which included Hurricane Ida. However, the third quarter of 2022 was tied for the second highest total for any given quarter since we began tracking the metrics in 2013 and we experienced to return to year-over-year growth in the month of October resulting from Hurricane Ian.  We continue to focus on expanding our distribution network as we experience sequential growth in our residential dealer base and ended the quarter with nearly 8,500 dealer partners, a net increase of approximately 300 dealers sequentially. Activations, which are a proxy for installs, continued to grow in the third quarter compared to the prior year.  However, as we mentioned in our preliminary announcement, installation capacity for home standby generators lagged our production output. The ability of installing contractors to fully service the demand for backup power from homeowners continues to be constrained by labor availability, permitting in utility-related delays, and shortages in certain materials needed to complete an installation. Furthermore, growth in our dealer base was constrained in prior quarters by our extended production lead times. All of this resulted in elevated levels of field inventory and lower-than expected orders from our channel partners, despite the continued strength in end-customer demand.  Importantly, to address these activation challenges, we are working on a number of specific initiatives to increase home standby installation bandwidth such as providing resources to help existing dealers to expand their labor forces and additional installation training locally for non-dealer contractors. We are working to streamline home standby projects by creating universal permitting packages and replicating past successes in simplifying approval processes from certain local utilities. Other efficiency-related initiatives include dealer scheduling and quotation refinement to enhance the top of the sales funnel and optimize the allocation in sales leads within the dealer channel to favor those dealers that have capacity to install more generators.  Importantly, we have also intensified efforts to further expand our overall dealer count and we expect another strong quarter of sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Our dealer count growth initiatives have recently benefited from our shorter production lead times, which have now mostly returned to normal levels as we ramped our production output of home standby generators in prior quarters.  Although installation capacity constraints have resulted in lower orders from our channel partners, it is important to reiterate that underlying demand and market fundamentals of the home standby category remains strong that supported by meaningfully sequential improvements in a number of key dealer-related metrics during the third quarter.  In-home consultations grew, close rates continue to rebound and while still elevated the time between contract signing and installation declined meaningfully as compared to the second quarter. Dealer productivity, as measured by activations per day per dealer improved to an all time high during the third quarter.  In addition, our dealer survey data suggests approximately half of all the field inventory is allocated to an active customer contract highlighting the need to further increase the pace of installs to close the gap between strong end-customer demand and installation capacity.  While the previously mentioned sequential improvements provide evidence that our channel partners are beginning to make progress in working through their elevated backlogs and field inventory, we expect home standby order headwinds to persist through the first half of 2023, as field inventory levels normalize.  Even when assuming no major outage events, in the second half of 2023, we expect significant sequential sales growth from the first half of the year and only a modest decline in sales on a year-over-year basis as we maintain a new and higher baseline level of demand.  Over the last 30 years, the home standby category has grown in a step function pattern as penetration rates have expanded rapidly for several years at a time driven by notable major power outage events followed by periods of flatter growth as demand normalizes. With each successive growth period comes increased awareness around home standby generators and increased distribution for these products, both which have been critical in helping the category reach new and higher levels of baseline demand. The latest growth steps that the product category has experienced was underpinned by an increase in power outage activity over the past several years with four of the top 10 major outage events since 2010 having occurred in just the last two years alone. This growth can be evidenced through a number of key market metrics in comparing the first three quarters of 2022 to the comparable period of 2019 as activations per day more than doubled, home consultations more than tripled and our dealer count increased by nearly 40% from 6,200 to 8,500. The approximate mid-teens compounded annual growth rate in the category over the past several decades can be tied to the increase in power outages over that time as the nation’s electrical grid has struggled to reliably supply power to homeowners and businesses. The ageing and underinvested grid infrastructure has become more vulnerable to the increasing severity of high impact weather-related events such as hurricanes, heat waves, ice storms and polar vortexes. Additionally, new megatrends have emerged that we believe will drive the next step of growth in the category. Grid resiliency concerns have been increasing as decarbonization trends accelerate causing a widening gap between supply and demand leaving many utilities and grid operators scrambling to avoid rolling blackouts over the past several years and we believe little has been done to rectify this situation.  We also believe the home essentially where megatrend will persist as the shift to remote or hybrid work remains intact. The electrification of homes continues to grow and demographic trends are driving increased levels of aging in place. With the nationwide penetration rates still in the mid-single-digit range, and these megatrends firmly intact, we are confident that the long-term growth trajectory for the home standby category remains significant.  I’d now like to discuss our residential clean energy products as shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the significant liquidity challenges of a large customer that seized operations and subsequently filed for bankruptcy. Additionally, during the quarter, we continued to address certain warranty-related matters for the upgrade of a components within our PWRcell energy storage system. As part of this effort, we have engaged a number of third-party service companies to assist with the completion of these upgrades and these efforts are well underway.  As a result of these items, we recorded a $55 million charge in the quarter, comprised of an $18 million bad debt reserve and a $37 million warranty charge. The challenges we experienced in our clean energy business from the third quarter were very disappointing, but we believe that the solar-plus energy storage market continues to represent an important strategic opportunity for Generac longer term. However, this quarter's results have demonstrated the need for us to further expand our distribution by focusing our efforts on partnering with high-quality, reputable sales and installation companies for these products. Importantly, we are committed to supporting the dealers that are participating in our warranty coverage upgrade program as they play a vital role in restoring our competitive in the residential clean energy space. In addition, we continue to broaden our product offering and bring new innovations to this market as we announced an update to the PWRcell energy storage system during the quarter that enables AC-coupled battery storage, as well as AC generator integration. Work also continues on our PV microinverter product called the PWRmicro, as our beta testing began late in the second quarter and will continue through the balance of this year. We anticipate a phased commercial roll out beginning in the first half of 2023 and a full commercial launch targeted for the second half of the year. I'd now like to provide a quick update on our ecobee acquisition, which we completed last December. During the initial period of our ownership, we have been focused on developing cross-selling opportunities for ecobee's hardware solutions through Generac's distribution partners and have seen positive indications of demand for smart thermostats alongside other clean energy products. Synergies between ecobee and Generac's grid services teams continues to be validated and we are identifying higher potential value creation for ecobee’s devices and demand response programs amid ongoing concerns around grid stability and rising energy prices. We have also begun leveraging the talented ecobee team to help accelerate our Connected Devices strategy, which is core to the development of our residential energy ecosystem that will ultimately be accessed and controlled by a single pane of glass user interface. I also want to provide some additional color on the efforts of our grid services team as they continue to execute on a growing and diversified sales pipeline. We have further expanded our efforts to extract synergies across our commercial teams as they work to offer an increasing mix of Generac hardware alongside our Concerto grid services software platform.  Our comprehensive suite of solutions aimed at distributed energy resource management-related programs is unmatched and is proving to be a competitive differentiator for our grid services team as the number of devices and megawatts of capacity connected to the Concerto platform continues to grow.  We announced a number of program wins since our second quarter call, including Software-as-a-Service contracts with Dominion Energy and U.K.-based Pearlstone Energy, as well as a performance contract with Arizona Public Service, which demonstrates Generac's unique ability to deliver end-to-end solutions in grid services programs. The long-term market opportunities for residential energy storage, microinverters, monitoring and management devices and grid services solutions remains highly attractive and core to our strategic vision. However the loss of a major customer during the quarter, along with the specific warranty-related issue, has impacted near-term demand and our outlook for the full year 2022.  We now expect the combination of clean energy technology products and services to deliver sales between $300 million to $330 million for the full year 2022, as compared to our previous guidance of approximately $500 million. Our continued investment in the people and processes involved in the development of these products remains a key focal area for the company as we work to further broaden our product offering, while also improving the quality and performance of the technologies we've acquired and developed over the last three years.  With that in mind, we're building a talented and focused clean energy noise management team beginning with the addition of Norm Tap in August as our new President of this organization, along with the new Chief Technology Officer, Senior Vice President of Finance, and a Senior Vice President of Policy. Norm and his team bring decades of industry leadership experience, as well as robust technical expertise that will help drive Generac's integrated clean energy technology solutions forward. Additionally, the policy backdrop for this market has never been more favorable with the Inflation Reduction Act providing the necessary visibility for long-term value-creating investments. We will continue to build out our energy technology leadership team and our suite of products and solutions as we expect to play an important role in the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable and more reliable electric grid. As a result of these investments and the strong outlook for this market, we expect clean energy technology sales to return to strong growth for the full year 2023 with sequentially improving results throughout the year. Our C&I products continue to perform exceptionally well in the quarter, as global C&I net sales increased 20% on an as-reported basis and 23% on a core sales basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and foreign currency as compared to the prior year.  Both in-shipments for domestic C&I products in the third quarter was led by strength across national rental equipment, telecom and industrial distributor customers. We experienced continued strength in demand during the quarter as backlog for our C&I products remained at record levels and expanded further in the month of October, giving us excellent visibility that solid growth will continue in the category well into 2023. Shipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel grew significantly again in the third quarter and order trends indicate this momentum will continue in the quarters ahead as backlog in the channel increased on a sequential basis. Quoting activity and close rates remain elevated, compared to prior year levels, highlighting our market share gains, as well as the durability of demand trends for backup power for C&I applications. Shipments to national telecom customers also increased again during the third quarter as compared to the prior year, as several of our larger national customers continue to invest in hardening their existing sites and the build-out of their fifth generation or 5G networks.  These networks are increasingly considered as part of the nation's critical infrastructure and require backup power for resiliency. Upgrades to telecom infrastructure remain one of the key megatrends that we expect to drive growth for our business in the coming years as global power and network hub counts continue to expand. We also experienced another quarter of substantial growth with our national and independent rental equipment customers as they continued to invest in equipment to refresh and expand their fleets. We anticipate the demand environment for mobile products will remain robust in the quarters ahead as the megatrend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements continues to play out. Strong customer interest for our natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects also continued in the quarter with sales of these products growing at an exceptional rate. We believe we are in the very early innings of growth for this exciting new market opportunity, as grid stability concerns and volatile energy markets are expected to further drive demand for these innovative solutions. We also took a significant step forward in our C&I generator connectivity efforts shortly after quarter end with the acquisition of Blue Pillar, an industrial Internet of Things platform developer that enables distributed energy generation monitoring and control.  Blue Pillar's connectivity solutions can make previously stranded C&I backup generators available for use in grid services programs by connection to the Concerto software platform and will provide a foundation for our longer-term vision of creating a single user interface for a suite of connected C&I assets. Our International segment continued to experience very strong momentum, as total sales increased 14% year-over-year during the third quarter with 22% core total sales growth when excluding the benefit of acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.  Core total sales growth was driven by strength across all regions, most notably in Europe and Latin America with intersegment sales also growing substantially in the quarter as our Generac Mexico facility further ramps production of telecom products for the North American market. The European region has seen remarkably strong demand across product lines, most notably in C&I and portable generators due to a heightened focus on energy independence and security. Concerns over power security amid the conflict in Ukraine have continued to rise and we are providing backup generators to the region through our European sales branches. Longer-term demand trends are less certain, however, as geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions in the region remain volatile, but end market awareness of the need for resiliency has increased across the continent in recent quarters.  The subsequent effect of the war on Europe's energy complex has highlighted the dependence on continuous power sources for homes and businesses around the globe. Looking into 2023 for our global C&I products, given the strong demand fundamentals and existing backlog, our preliminary view anticipates continued strong year-over-year growth throughout the entire year. In closing, this morning, we were disappointed that our third quarter results were below our prior expectations. But we believe we have action plans in place to address the underlying challenges in the business. New clean energy technology leadership has brought an increased emphasis on quality and innovation, and we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity for this strategic area of our business. Important initiatives to help ease home standby installation bottlenecks are well underway. And as the home standby market normalizes, we are confident that the new and higher baseline of end demand for the product category will become clearer.  Hurricane Ian is the latest example of increasingly severe and more volatile weather patterns, and we believe the power grid's growing supply and demand imbalance is far from resolved, as we add intermittent renewable generation sources, while simultaneously pursuing the electrification of our homes, our businesses and our transportation. The secular growth themes and megatrends supporting the company's Powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy remain firmly intact, and as reliance on electricity around the world grows further, we will continue to invest in innovative products and solutions to lead the evolution to the next generation grid. I now want to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our third quarter 2022 results, our outlook for the year and our preliminary views on 2023. York?
York Ragen : Thanks, Aaron. Looking at third quarter 2022 results in more detail, net sales increased 15% and to $1.09 billion during the third quarter of 2022, as compared to $943 million in the prior year third quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 5% net back on revenue growth during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the third quarter by product class. Residential product sales grew to $664 million as compared to $609 million in the prior year, representing a 9% increase over a strong prior year comparable. Contributions from the ecobee acquisition and the slight unfavorable impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 5% of revenue growth for the quarter. Home standby generator sales made up the majority of the residential product core sales growth, increasing at a solid mid-teens rate over the prior year. This was partially offset by weakness in shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems. Commercial and industrial product sales for the third quarter of 2022 increased 20% to $311 million as compared to $258 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency provided a net headwind of more than 2% to net sales growth during the quarter. The strong core net sales growth was broad-based across most regions, internationally and across all channels domestically with particular strength in national rental equipment, telecom, industrial distributor and energy management channels. Net sales for the other products and services category increased 49% to $113 million as compared to $76 million in the third quarter of 2021. Core sales growth for the category was 17% due to strength in aftermarket service parts and extended warranty revenue recognition, along with strong growth in our services offerings in certain parts of our business, both domestically and internationally. Gross profit margin was 33.2% compared to 35.6% in the prior year third quarter as we continue to experience modest price cost headwinds during the quarter from a margin percent standpoint. In addition, recent acquisitions and a less favorable sales mix, primarily driven by a lower proportion of home standby product sales, also negatively impacted margins in the current year quarter. Operating expenses increased $111 million or 68% as compared to the third quarter of 2021. This increase includes $55.3 million of pretax charges comprised of $17.9 million of bad debt expense related to a clean energy product customer that is filed for bankruptcy and a $37.3 million charge for clean energy product warranty-related matters.  The remaining increase was primarily driven by higher recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions and an increase in intangible amortization expense. To a lesser extent, higher employee costs and higher marketing spend also contributed to the increase. Adjusted EBITDA, before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $184 million or 16.9% of net sales in the third quarter as compared to $209 million or 22.2% of net sales in the prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 18% to $947 million in the quarter, as compared to $802 million in the prior year with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 8% of the revenue growth for the quarter.  Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $160 million, representing a 16.9% margin as compared to $188 million in the prior year or 23.4% of net sales. The lower domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to continued price cost headwinds. In addition, continued operating expense investments for future growth and the impact of acquisitions had an unfavorable effect on margins during the quarter, as operating expenses as a percentage of sales came in higher than expected on the lower shipment volumes relative to expectations. International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 14% to $183 million in the quarter as compared to $160 million in the prior year quarter. Core total sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 22% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests was $24 million or 13.2% of net sales as compared to $21.5 million or 13.4% of net sales in the prior year. This margin performance was impacted by a higher mix of lower-margin intersegment sales, which was mostly offset by favorable operating leverage on significantly higher volumes. Now switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2022 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $58 million as compared to $132 million for the third quarter of 2021. The current year net income includes the pretax charges totaling $55.3 million related to the clean energy bad debt and warranty-related matters. GAAP income taxes during the quarter – GAAP income taxes during the current year third quarter was $11.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 16.1% as compared to $32.6 million or an effective tax rate of 19.7% for the prior year. The reduction was due to multiple discrete tax items that drove the tax rate down versus prior year on a net basis. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.83 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $1.93 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $112 million in the current year quarter or $1.75 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $151 million in the prior year or $2.35 per share. Cash flow from operations was negative $56 million as compared to positive $74 million in the prior year third quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release was negative $73 million as compared to positive $42 million in the same quarter last year.  The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year was primarily due to lower operating earnings, increased tax payments and higher working capital levels in the current year quarter, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2022, we have approximately $1.48 billion of liquidity, comprised of approximately $230 million of cash on hand and $1.25 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.36 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter of 1.6 times on an as-reported basis. Additionally, during the third quarter, we repurchased 536,006 shares of our common stock for $123.9 million, which exhausted our previously existing stock repurchase program.  In July 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to 500 million of our common stock over a 24-month period. With that, I will now provide further comments on our updated outlook. As previously disclosed 2 weeks ago within our pre-release, we updated our net sales growth and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for the full year.  In line with the pre-release, we still expect net sales in 2022 to increase between 22% to 24% as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis, which includes an approximate 5% to 7% net impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This revenue outlook assumes sales of residential and C&I products both increased at a similar rate in the low to mid-20% range during 2022 over the prior year. Also in line with our pre-release adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are still expected to be approximately 18% to 19%. This EBITDA margin expectation reflects a modest sequential improvement in gross margins in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter levels, with higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales, partially offsetting the sequential gross margin improvement. Now I'd like to provide some further comments regarding our initial framework for net sales growth in 2023. Summarizing Aaron's earlier remarks, our preliminary view for 2023 anticipates that the first half of the year will experience year-over-year weakness on a consolidated basis. We expect to return to solid growth in the second half of the year, resulting in overall net sales to only decline modestly for the full year 2023 as compared to 2022. Again, as Aaron previously discussed, home standby generator sales growth is expected to face significant headwinds in the first half of 2023. But as field inventories normalize, we anticipate strong sequential sales growth and a much more modest decline in sales growth over the prior year in the second half of 2023. Clean energy technology is expected to experience robust sales growth for the full year as we continue to expand our presence, build out our distribution and launch new products into this market, resulting in sequentially improving results during 2023.  Our preliminary view for 2023 C&I product sales growth anticipates continued strong growth throughout the year. This preliminary guidance assumes power outage activity that is in line with the long-term baseline average, and does not assume a prolonged recessionary environment that meaningfully impacts consumer spending during 2023. Additionally, this is a preliminary early look into our 2023 forecast, and we will provide a more detailed update when we report fourth quarter results in mid-February of next year. Shifting back to 2022, we will now provide additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the full year 2022. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 24.5% for the fourth quarter of the year, resulting in a full year 2022 GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 21.5%.  For full year 2022, we now expect interest expense to be approximately $53 million to $55 million, an increase from the previous guidance of $52 million to $54 million, reflecting higher than previously expected benchmark interest rates. This assumes no additional changes in outstanding debt for the remainder of the year. Depreciation expense is still expected to be approximately $54 million to $56 million in 2022. GAAP intangible amortization expense in '22 is still expected to be approximately $100 million to $105 million. Stock compensation expense is still expected to be between $32 million and $34 million for the year. Our full year weighted average diluted share count is now expected to be approximately 64.5 million shares compared to the previous guidance of 65 million to 65.5 million shares. Our capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately 2% to 2.5% of our forecasted net sales for the year compared to prior guidance of approximately 2.5% to 3% of net sales. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be closer to 100% of adjusted net income in the fourth quarter as the investment in working capital begins to level off. Finally, this updated 2022 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Halloran with Baird. Your line is now open. 
Michael Halloran : Hey, good morning, guys. 
Aaron Jagdfeld : Very good morning, Mike. 
Michael Halloran : So just kind of want to talk through what happened between second quarter to today is the first question. Obviously, in the second quarter, you talked about installation challenges potentially being a headwind but I think the magnitude caught a lot of people by surprise and how quickly that changed. And so could you maybe talk about the dynamic that got you misaligned with what was happening in the channel. That’s the first question?
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yeah, Mike, this is Aaron. Yeah, it's a great question and one that obviously not only caught us by surprise, but even our channel partners. I think we hit kind of our peak output levels with home standby. We've been working very hard over the last couple of years to – we've quadrupled the output and we really – we hit our stride as we predicted we would kind of as we exited the second quarter and began the third quarter. And so we’re producing at a really high rate. And we thought that was really important because we wanted to bring our lead times down, because we knew that that was having a negative impact on close rates, it's having a negative impact on our ability to sign new channel partners. So we really – we're working hard to do that and so we kind of open the floodgates on shipping to get all that product out in the market. And what we started to see at the end of the second quarter, and we mentioned it, as you said on the call, was that our installation, our activation rate, which is our proxy for installations, it was up year-over-year, but it wasn't increasing at the same rate commensurate with our output increase. And so we could see field inventory building.  And we had been talking to our channel partners for several quarters about this coming. And we were trying to get them prepared for that, helping them hire people. We had a number of programs actually in place to get ahead of this, but in the end, it's just – that we have 8,500 channel partners, dealers and then obviously, a lot of non-dealer contractors who install these products. And it's a ton of one-off conversations, and we just weren't able to change that inflection point on the installation rate to the degree we thought we could. So the flaw in the model, the simple answer is, the flaw in the model here was that we modeled unconstrained installation bandwidth and that actually was not how it played out. We had never had that happen before, by the way. I've seen probably six of these cycles in the past, and successively as we kind of hit our peak rate with new output levels, we had never seen the installation bandwidth be a barrier. So that was the problem. And it, unfortunately, stacked up really quick when you're shipping at those rates and only installing at kind of marginally higher rates. So the field inventory started to stack up, and they physically started to run out of room, run out of credit.  And so what we saw is we saw cancellations and deferrals on orders from those home standby dealers and other channel partners during the quarter, and that accelerated through the quarter here in Q3. And it became very clear very quickly and again, that's why we did the prerelease because as soon as we put all this together, we can see what happened a couple of weeks ago.  It's like, okay, this is information we want to get to folks so they understand it. And we've redoubled our efforts, tripled our efforts on what we can do to increase installation bandwidth. So anyway, that's kind of answering your first question. That's the issue in a nutshell if you will, for home standby.
Michael Halloran : So, that's super helpful and related, if I think about the time it's going to take to sync the channel up. I guess I'm having a hard time thinking of the idea that the underlying pieces are still pretty healthy and you gave a lot of good metrics in the prepared remarks and in the press release around what's happening on the consultation side, the closures, et cetera with how long it's going to take to right-size the inventory and maybe it's just a bandwidth conversation with where the installers are at.  But I'd love to have a sense for how I can kind of take that timeframe and sync it with what you're calling still pretty healthy underlying demand.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yeah, I think probably the best way to maybe get your head around that is we believe that currently today, field inventory levels are about double where they should be. And so that's the bad news, right? That's the additional output that we’ve put into the market ahead of the installation capacity increasing to the right levels. We are modeling that installation capacity is going to increase next year.  The challenge, of course, is that just seasonally, we're coming into – as we turn the page here and get into Q1 and Q2, we normally run into a seasonally low period of installations, because parts of the country like the Midwest and the Northeast where installations are much harder to do because of the cold weather because of winter. So unfortunately, even though we are targeting the installations are going to improve year-over-year, we have this seasonal challenge we've got to deal with. It's just nature. We can't really, that's a hard one to fix. And so it won't increase necessarily as quickly as we needed to in the first half. Now the good news is, when we pull our dealers, half of that field inventory that's out there today is spoken for, meaning it's got a customer contract against it. A customer has got a deposit on it. And again, it's indicative of the installation challenge, because we're now back to what we said in the prepared remarks is mostly normal lead times. We still have backlog.  We have a couple of models - we're still out there, some liquid cool products, things like that. So that's supportive of where we're going here in Q4. But what ends up happening is that we have these mostly normal lead times for us to our channel partner, but if you are a homeowner and you call and you try and get a product, you still are being quoted longer lead times, because of these constraints, whether they’d be people constraints or permitting constraints or component constraints, gas meter upgrades, we've – there are localized issues all over the country where some of our channel partners are bumping up against just delays.  And so they're working through that and as those ease, that will help. But we think that it's likely going to take the first half of next year to get through this and that's going to put pressure on the incoming order rate for home standby through the first half of next year and so that's really the challenge.  We think that, again, in our prepared remarks, we said by the second half of the year, we're back to growing again in the category and really only down modestly for the year in total for the category. So anyway, so that's – it’s I think when you put it all together, we feel pretty good about longer term that the end market is supportive.
Michael Halloran : That makes sense. So basically, what you're saying is relatively normal sequentials on the home standby category for the next few quarters from a couple quarters from the run rate you're talking about in the back half of this year before there is a potential inflection as things start catching up and normalizing a little bit.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Right. Return to normal seasonality, return to growth in the second half. 
Michael Halloran : Yes. 
Aaron Jagdfeld : And then again, just the first half is going to be down considerably, second half will grow, still down kind of moderately for the category, only modestly for the company overall. That's kind of our overall guide for next year, but just to clarify that.
Michael Halloran : Yes. Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for that. Appreciate it.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes, thanks, Mike. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with Key. Your line is now open. 
Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, good morning, guys. 
York Ragen: Good morning, Jeff. 
Aaron Jagdfeld : Hey Jeff. 
Jeffrey Hammond : Hey just on kind of the – as you're thinking about the guide, I just want to kind of understand how you're thinking about like comping the backlog drawdown that you're seeing this year and then what that would imply for kind of underlying demand for the category.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yeah, I mean, again, that's a big part of the headwind for the first half of next year is the comp, because we're – obviously, we were bringing that backlog down heavily in the first two quarters of this year and so we'll be comping against that without having the benefit of that backlog kind of as we get into next year. So that's a big part of it.
York Ragen : And then Aaron's point about the home standby category being down moderately in the second half, that's because you are trying to comp like some of that backlog headwind that we're bringing down here in the back...
Aaron Jagdfeld : Moderately in total, returning to growth in the second half, but yes, for 2023.
York Ragen : Yes, for the standby.
Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, okay. 
Aaron Jagdfeld : For standby. We're talking just standby.
York Ragen : Yes, yes. We're just talking standby. But that – we've got an headwind on the backlog that's driving that.
Aaron Jagdfeld : That's what's driving that, exactly.
Jeffrey Hammond : And then, just what are you guys doing with your production levels as you get this reset? And just how should we think about destock of your own inventory? It looks like your own inventories are a bit elevated as well.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes, they are and you saw that read through just the work capital increase in the third quarter, driving free cash flow negative for the quarter. We see that coming back around in Q4. So, we basically slowed the factories down still have some material coming at us, but that's starting to slow as well. We should basically get into a better position in Q4 and then really working hard through the first half of next year to bring down those inventory levels, both raw materials and finished goods as it relates to the home standby category in particular.  It's actually kind of a dichotomy, because in our industrial business, we're constrained still in certain components and our inventory levels are low and we are struggling to kind of feed our factories with materials there on our industrial side and we would be able to, in fact, go even higher, faster with our industrial business if we could get more engines and breakers and other things that are in shorter supply. But on the home standby side, we are definitely seeing a lot of material hitting our distribution centers as we slow production down.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is now open. 
Brian Drab : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. 
York Ragen : Hey, Brian. 
Brian Drab : Maybe shifting to clean, hey, good morning. Just shifting to clean energy for a minute. So, I think that the energy storage business in 2021 was around $220 million, $225 million. It looks like the guidance that you're giving us now for $300 million to $330 million implies that that's down something like 30% or so this year. Is that about right and what market is growing and can you clarify...
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes, market is still growing, although there is some mixed comments out there about the market growth. But, yes, the loss of that major customer of ours in the second half of the year here, they really ceased operations in July. So we've got to do the hard work that, honestly, we should have been doing all along of continuing to expand our channel to more channel partners, but that hurts us definitely in the year, Brian. So, unfortunately, that's going to be down this year.  Looking for that to return to growth next year. But as we kind of fill in with new customers and we kind of reset, so 2022 is going to end up being a reset year for us here on energy storage, which is disappointing, but I think – and a rather painful learning lesson for us on just some of the trials and tribulations of that market some of the customers and the dealer partners there, you're having to pick your partners carefully. Again, a lot of learning cycles we are going through there.
Brian Drab : Okay. Thanks. And then, for my second question, can you just clarify exactly what you're saying about 2023 one more time in terms of – I think that you said total company in the prepared remarks, it's all about total company and that you'd be down modestly for the full year, up sequentially first half to second half. But I am just wondering, is home standby expected to be up year-over-year in the second half?
York Ragen : Yes, this is York. So yes, so total company, to clarify, we said weakness in the first half, total company, mainly driven by the home standby discussion we just had a little bit of, maybe a little bit of clean energy as we build growth there.  But second half, I think important to note, total company returned to solid growth for total company in the second half. You put that all together then for full year, that would only be a modest decline for full year 2023. That's total company.  So then home standby specifically, again, weakness first half, sequential growth from first half to second half and then a much more modest decline in sales growth over the prior year in the second half of the year. So maybe down a little bit, but it's much more modest decline relative to the first half for home standby.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. 
Mark Strouse : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. York, curious if you can just talk about margins through the first half of next year? Just kind of the lower factory absorption with HSB, the lower mix of HSB and then kind of offsetting that somewhat easing of some of the supply chain issues that you've had. And how we should think about margins going forward?
York Ragen : Yes. No, I think Aaron mentioned a return to seasonality for the home standby business, meaning Q1 is usually the lowest point in the curve once you catch backlog, then you return to normal seasonality, Q1 is the lowest point. So, you would expect, just from a mix standpoint, that sequentially from Q4 2022 to Q1 2023, that gross margin should decline because – mainly because of that mix element.  But, I mean, recall we were facing some pretty heavy inflationary pressures in Q1 of 2022. So I would expect just from a price cost standpoint, we are going to see some nice price cost benefit there. But yes, we are still putting our models together on how that's going to look, but I would expect just sequentially that given the mix - the mix changes going into the first half of next year, you'd see maybe a slight decline in gross margins relative to the runrate.
Mark Strouse : Okay. And then just to clarify on the Clean Power business. Is most of the reduction in the revenue outlook driven by needing to backfill for the customer that has gone bankrupt? Or is there a broader issue with the actual product itself that there is some actual reconfiguring of the solution?
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yeah the majority of the market is related to the loss of the customer. It was a really important customer for us and the diversification of our customer base is going to be the primary focus here going forward. And obviously, we've got to restore trust, too, right, in the market to some degree. There is probably a spillover effect there to a bit. But I will say this, and like I said, we've got a lot to learn in this market. That’s a painful learning lesson. But in speaking with a lot of the kind of national companies that are well established, the national solar sales and installation companies, almost every OEM has had challenges over the course of the solar kind of markets’ existence and storage being the new component here. So, again, I am not trying to indicate that people should expect that, but it's a pretty new market. I mean, penetration rates are very low on these products. The environment, being rooftop mounted, electronics is a severe environment. The warranty periods are very long. 25-year warranty periods for the rooftop mounter components, 10 years on the batteries. So you've got a pretty – you’ve got a pretty, there is a pretty high bar there quality-wise and a lot of companies have unfortunately struggled with that. Now, I think, we feel like we, a couple of things. One, we're very committed to this. We think it's the future. We think it's an important part of our strategy going forward. I think it represents some great opportunities for Generac in terms of what can fit with our brand. Our distribution and our expertise in some of these areas. So we're committed to it. We've got a great balance sheet to be able to finance this.  The investment needed, obviously, is going to be greater than we had originally thought. You can't just take a start-up technology and try to scale it. That's clear based on our experiences here. So we are going to have to do a lot more work around that. We are going to have to put more talent in the teams. We've started to do that.  We mentioned that in some of our prepared remarks this morning, and we're going to continue to do that. We think that this is, again, it's an important part of the future. We're committed to it and we are going to be a major player in it longer term. We are going to take our lumps here and the humility that comes with that. But in the end, I believe that we will have a lot of great success in this longer term..
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joseph Osha with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. 
Joseph Osha : Thanks. 
York Ragen : Hi, Joe. Morning. 
Joseph Osha : I wanted to spend a bit more time on the clean energy business. We've talked a lot about storage, which is great. Ecobee is a good size business. So I'm wondering as you look into the next year. Obviously, you don't want to get too detailed, but maybe if you can give us a little bit of a sense as to the – roughly what the breakdown of that business might look like? And on a related note, now that you've got the safety couple products, we talked about this before, given some of the challenges that you've talked about with some of the other stuff, could we see you perhaps pivot more to selling that AC couple product alongside other people's inverters? So those are my two questions.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes. Joe, great questions. Just let me touch on the ecobee piece first and then I'll get to the AC coupled solution. So on ecobee, there – it's a great company, really well run. It’s - they've really struggled this year with component availability in the first half of the year. So they've under-delivered a bit to our expectations and their own expectations just around that. But things have really picked up here as they exited the third quarter. They're looking at fourth quarter being their highest quarter ever as a company and looking at big things. I think a lot of that, you can probably tie back to higher energy prices, right?  Homeowners, I think, are looking for solutions to mitigate those higher energy prices, and smart thermostat is kind of a really cost-effective way to go after that. The paybacks are really strong, and you buy one of these products, inside of a year, you can pay that back. And that's even -- not even assuming the opportunity to connect that thermostat to a grid services type program, like a demand response program, which can enhance the payback even more.  So really excited about that business. I think when we announced it, it's something like $125 million. It's grown nicely this year and will continue to grow and we're not going to break down the pieces because we don't want to get into doing that every quarter here going forward. So, but it's a great business, well run and a lot of upside there. And I think one of the bigger opportunities within that is just the team that they have, the expertise they have is going to be central to this single pane of glass initiative that we see as sitting at the heart of the smart home energy system that we've talked about, connecting whether it be generators or PV microinverters or storage devices or smart thermostats or water heater disconnect switches, load management, ultimately EV charging, things like that. We think all of that...
Joseph Osha : I did hear you say $125 million for this year, right?
Aaron Jagdfeld : No, that was what we said when we announced the deal back in December. That was their runrate.
Joseph Osha : Okay. All right.
York Ragen : They've grown nicely.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes, they've grown nicely since then. And then on the AC coupled – the AC coupling that is definitely a focal area and one of the things that we've been pushing to get into the market the microinverter or excuse me, the PV, the PWRcell with a firmware update can accept power from third-party ACQUISITION, our third-party inverters now.  So we feel really good about that and that's going to be a focus area for our commercial teams as we go forward. So looking forward to that getting some traction in the marketplace and we think that that we'll see success of that.
Joseph Osha : Thank you. 
Aaron Jagdfeld : You bet. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. 
Jerry Revich : Yes, hi, good morning, everyone. Aaron, I wonder if you could talk about the production rate for the standby business. In the fourth quarter, normal seasonality I think installs tend to be up low double-digits are we now at a normalized runrate where that business can be up sequentially in your term based on the visibility you have as of today?
Aaron Jagdfeld : Well, production rates won't be because we're bringing those down because of the field inventory issue, and we've got plenty of inventory, as well. So, that – if the question is around production rates, we won't be up in the fourth quarter. We'll be lower. So we expect that and that's built into our guide today. But again, installation capacity, that normally, seasonally does peak in the fourth quarter.  And we continue to see, again, we added 300 new dealers in the quarter alone, which is helpful for that. We are pacing well, again, to add more dealers here in the fourth quarter and we need to be hitting our peak rates for installation by the end of the year, but that's all contemplated in the guidance. I don't know if I'm answering your question, Jerry or not, but.
Jerry Revich : Yes. And earlier, you mentioned production would be down as normal seasonality in the first quarter as well. And so I am just trying to understand, right, after every major outage event, there is a new and higher baseline, but that baseline is obviously down from the peak.  And I'm just wondering, are we going to be running at that baseline based on the order rates that you see today without making any assumptions on installation capacity as we head into, call it, $400 million standby revenue quarter in the first quarter? Does that match the incoming order rate? Or is there a risk of additional step down?
Aaron Jagdfeld : No, no. So what we've said is that the order rate is going to continue to – we're going to have headwinds there as they work their field inventory down. So they've got – again, field inventory, which is about double where we should be at this time of the year, and "normal" in terms of days of field inventory is about double.  But about half of that – so really the problem, right, the doubling is already sold. So they just have to get it installed. So because of that, we're not – the order rate is going to be artificially depressed until we get through that.
York Ragen : I guess, the hurricane will increase the backlog of our dealers basically that will...
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes, effectively right, exactly. And could accelerate some of the drawdown of field inventory in the Florida regions, in particular, where Ian impacted. But no, we think that the order rates that we are seeing today that we'll continue to see through the end of this year and in the first half of next year are artificially low as we right-size that field inventory.
York Ragen : And remember, we have some backlog in the fourth quarter here that we’re satisfying as well.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Exactly. That's a good point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. 
Maheep Mandloi : Hey. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you enough guidance on gross margins for the C&I – for the HSB projects in Q4 and the first half. But maybe if you could just opine on OpEx in Q4 and the first half given all the data points you're seeing on channel inventory and in-house consolidations? Should we expect any changes over there? And then I just have a follow-up on i should go.
York Ragen : This is York. OpEx, I think, I alluded to it. OpEx may tweak up a little bit here in the fourth quarter as a percentage of sales relative to Q3. Just there is actually just some seasonality on some spend in Q4, some accrual reversals in Q3 that won't repeat. So, just a modest increase in OpEx sequentially, both dollars and as a percentage of sales, what we're modeling in our guidance.
Maheep Mandloi : And any guidance on how should we think about it in 2023?
York Ragen : No. I mean, we're still – we're just – we gave the framework for the top-line. We're still working on the framework for gross margins and OpEx. So I think we are going to hold off on discussions on the margin side for next year until next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. 
Kashy Harrison : Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. So just the first one from me, so the C&I and other segments, both quite strong. Can you maybe just dig into some detail on the strength in both of those segments in Q3? And then, maybe speak to the specific indicators you're seeing right now that gives you confidence of a continuation of strong growth entering calendar 2023 so early? And I have a follow-up.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes, Kashy, really, the C&I business has been ripping along here for a number of quarters and really hitting its stride. We are taking share in the market. We're seeing in our industrial distribution channel. Everything was up basically in C&I. So our telecom vertical that is a really important vertical for the company was up.  Our mobile business was up as the national rental accounts continue to refleet and top off their fleets our business internationally, which is mostly C&I, was also up very nicely. Again, just a lot of the same opportunities there. Probably one area that I would call out that was up even more so than in past and I think we categorized that in the prepared remarks as early inning, was this kind of – we refer to it as beyond standby applications.  So, mainly natural gas generators, large C&I natural gas generators that would otherwise have normally been sold into emergency backup-type of applications are being sold into applications where they are still used as emergency backup power, but they can also be called upon to support the grid during times of significant stress. So, heat waves, outages, things like that. So think micro grids or kind of energy-as-a-service types of programs, demand programs where the generator can be switched on remotely by a grid operator or a utility oftentimes connected through our grid services software platform, Concerto and we're seeing that market was up really large in the quarter for us.  Now it's still pretty small in totality, but it's growing very quickly and the quality conversations we are having with people on projects, potential projects in the future, the pipeline here for that business looks really good. So much so that we are oriented around adding capacity in our C&I factories to accommodate that growth.  And so, additional test capacity, additional manufacturing capacity, additional sheet metal fabrication capacity, we're making investments there, so that we can be ready for that business as it grows because we think it's a fundamental part of the mega trend that we've identified of kind of the grid instability issues that are coming from the rapid decarbonization of utility scale sources and the - on the demand side, the electrification of everything, inclusive of transportation. This supply-demand imbalance, many utilities and grid operators have really struggled here and had to scramble over the summer in particular. Now they were able to avoid any major outages, which was pretty remarkable. But in the end, the reserve margins, that's really kind of what it gets down to is the reserve margins is the excess capacity or sources that they have over demand.  And those reserve margins have gotten compressed dramatically in certain markets out West, even here in the Midwest, where the reserve margins are down to kind of critical levels, where if you get a spike in demand or you get some kind of interruption in supply, a major plant goes offline or there's some other disruption, can cause significant challenges. And this is really at the heart of what happened in February of last year in Texas. The cold snap that happened there has exacerbated the supply-demand challenges that were underlying what was going on in the ERCOT region or the ERCOT market.  And so the opportunity to use generators, fossil fuel generators, but natural gas generators, which burn much cleaner, obviously, than diesel generators, has really come into focus as a potential opportunity to use these assets for the purposes of grid support. So that was kind of what happened in C&I in a nutshell. As you mentioned, the other category was also up nicely. That encompasses some of our monitoring businesses, encompasses some other areas of the business that have been growing very nicely, as well. So, between those two segments or not segments, but product classifications, those we saw really nice growth in the third quarter.
Kashy Harrison : And just the indicators you're seeing that give you the confidence for 2023 so early on?
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes, so, the C&I business is a backlog business. I mean, that always has been a backlog business. So we look at that, you've got lead times on products there that, in some cases, go out 26, 36 weeks depending on the size of the product. It's custom built and it always has been this way. This is not the new kernel in the story over the last two years is the fact that home standby, which has never been a backlog business became a backlog business.  But the C&I business has always been backlog, provides great visibility for us. So we feel very good about that. You are also seeing kind of some of the public statements, like if you look at the national rental account customers that we sell to, they are indicating that they believe their CapEx budgets and CapEx spends are going to continue to grow into 2023 as, again, some of these mega trends around the infrastructure investments that need to be made around the country.  We had the investment, the Infrastructure Act that did get passed earlier this year. There's a lot of spending that's going to come through for that, for roads and bridges and airports and ports and all those types of massive infrastructure areas, our rental customers are going to serve that. The telecom business continues to – our telecom customers continue to tell us that their midstream and the build-out of their – not only hardening their existing networks, but the build-out of their fifth-generation or 5G networks. So that feels really good.  And then, again, the quality of the pipeline, as I said, around some of these newer things like the beyond standby opportunities, the microgrid opportunities in C&I. We think that there is – those have a lot of legs yet going into 2023.
York Ragen : Yes, the fact that book-to-bill remains strong is promising for next year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. 
Praneeth Satish : Thanks. Good morning. I guess if we could just focus only on the second half of 2023 for a second, you mentioned that HSB could be down, but I would have thought by then that the field inventory and the installation issues would have been resolved or normalized. So I am just wondering what's kind of driving that view for HSB in the second half of 2023, given that demand is so strong and is there a scenario where it could be up?
York Ragen : Yes. No, I think we alluded to it before that I mean, there is some backlog that were satisfying here in the second half of 2022 that won't repeat. So there is a little bit of a, I guess, year-over-year headwind when you're looking at 2023 versus 2022.
Aaron Jagdfeld : The guide also doesn't contemplate any major outages.
York Ragen : Yeah, that would be upside. So if you're looking for upside, where could we grow...
Aaron Jagdfeld : We did have some outages this year.
York Ragen : Yes, things happen. Mother Nature happens. So that would definitely be a scenario where things could grow. But that's an inherent – the backlog situation here, resolving that backlog here in the second half of 2022 is an inherent headwind for the second half of 2023.  But I think sequentially, as we get through these field inventory challenges here in the first half, you definitely would see growth sequentially from first half to second half, at least in terms of how we're seeing it in our framework here for 2023.
Praneeth Satish : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just switching gears on PWRcell, you mentioned that a certain component needed to be upgraded and so you're enlisting kind of third-party installers for repairs. Can you elaborate on what that component is? And then, has that component been fixed in new batteries that are being produced?
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes. We have an upgrade path on that component. It's a rooftop mounted shutoff device and that device is the previous generation of that device, it has a higher failure rate than what we'd like to see. So we're proactively replacing those devices for customers. So they don't see an interruption of the production of their systems. So, but everything is – we've got path forward and have had a path forward here for some time.  We just have to get the upgrades complete. And so to speed that up, we brought in a bunch of third-party, service companies that are going to help us do that. We were relying on some of our channel partners, but with the loss of that largest channel partner became obvious that we needed to enlist the help of others, and that's why the third-party folks are going to be in there. And that upgrade, the total effort there is what's reflected in that additional warranty reserve charge that we took here in the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Donovan Schafer from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open. 
Donovan Schafer : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Hi, can you hear me?
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes. 
Donovan Schafer : Okay, okay. Good. So, on the home standby side, I was just curious, is there any kind of a pattern in the lower orders from the channel partners in terms of, is it more concentrated on the side of big-box retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's or maybe regional installers or even potentially kind of the longer tail smaller installers?  I think the smaller installers tend to be limited, maybe more on warehouse space and access or willingness to use credit. So, I am just curious if it kind of is disproportionately in any one of those areas? And then I have a follow-up.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Not dramatically, so, Donovan. I mean, it's pretty much fits the historical in terms of just the channel, the mix, if you will, the channel mix within home standby hasn't changed dramatically. I mean, we do have some of this "stocking channels" right? Like if you look at a retailer or you look at a wholesaler for us, those are traditionally stocking channels where a non-dealer contractor comes in or a homeowner comes in and buys one of the products stock.  Whereas our dealers, they generally only buy from us when they have a contract signed by a homeowner because they – and that's nothing has changed with that. That's kind of the way the business has pace. So I think to answer your question, there is nothing dramatically different about the mix channel-to-channel going on there.
Donovan Schafer : Okay. And then, as - my next – my follow-up question is just, focusing on what's going on in Europe, because you guys – in commercial and industrial, and you really are kind of a global business and you've got a lot in Europe and India other parts of Southeast Asia, there is kind of just so much.  But when I look at what's going on in Europe, it feels like there are a lot of puts and takes that could be kind of both tailwinds and headwinds because you've got the energy crisis and all the fees and stability around there, but then simultaneously, you are also going to have people saying, this is why we shouldn't be using natural gas.  And so there might be resistance against natural gas infrastructure and installing more generator sets to rely on that. Maybe even if there's any diesel that might be seen as much more of like a short-term thing and so they don't want to invest the CapEx for a longer-term back up. So, it just seems like there is a lot of potential puts and takes there and the sort of differences of Eastern Europe versus Western Europe. So could you just go under a little bit more detail on like what exactly you are seeing specifically in Europe and how that's kind of unfolding for your businesses?
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes, yes. It's a good question. I mean, Europe has and has always been a mostly diesel C&I generator market. So that's just to level set. We have seen growth in natural gas gen sets in not only the European market, but also India, here recently coming off a base of almost nothing. There is – there is nothing there.  And I think on the margins, maybe on the edges, I should say not to confused with gross margins or anything like that, on the edges of the discussion, yes, there are some pipeline - people want to limit gas connections. Natural gas isn't going away. That is about the most foolish thing for people to think is the right answer for anything here. Natural gas is needed for heating, for cooking. It's plentifully available, it burns cleanly. We would do well as a society to continue to focus on further improvements in cleaning up the emissions that come from natural gas, whether it be the extraction emissions or it's the consumption emissions.  But because I think it's a fuel that can really help us shift as a populous here, as a global populous, further away from more carbon-intense forms of energy generation like coal and other fuels. So again, it's not – it might be on the edges, you are going to see some natural gas limitation just like we are seeing here in the U.S. in places like California, Berkeley, other places like that where they've taken the – they've taken it on themselves to close off new natural gas connections. The reality of it is you can get a propane tank anyway.  So I mean, it's kind of a fruitless effort the generators are off of propane as well. So you don't actually need pipeline. It's helpful, but you don't need pipeline gas. So, again, I think there is – our view is there is going to be plenty of growth in the C&I generator world, even the home standby generator world outside of North America and natural gas gens are going to be part of that natural gas and propane gens.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Your line is now open. 
Saree Boroditsky : Thanks for fitting me in. So just going back to the home standby commentary, you talked about only a modest decline in the second half of the year. Could you just help frame how you're thinking about the magnitude of the decline in the first half of the year?
York Ragen : No, we didn't necessarily frame that out. I think what we're looking at is more – when you look at the total company returning to solid growth in the second half resulting in only a modest decline for the total company for the full year. So, you can sort of get the magnitude of – what that means for the first half on a total basis.  You know that as based on our comments that C&I is going to continue to be strong in the first half. So you'll see growth there. We'll be sequentially improving our clean energy business throughout the year in 2023. And so that basically leaves you sort of – gives you some framework for how to put all the pieces together.
Saree Boroditsky : Okay. And then, it seems like sales grew faster at home standby than anticipated when you kind of gave out that 2024 guidance. Could you provide us with an estimate on where that puts you from a penetration rate at the end of this year and then any thoughts on where we could go from there?
Aaron Jagdfeld : Well, pen rate this year, we're around 6% is where we anticipate ending. So, it doesn't – it didn't change that dramatically and we are going to have to update our guidance on the long-range guidance. Again, I would point out, we did say at our Investor Day, that growth was not going to happen in a straight line. I know we have people who haven't been around the company that long and are learning kind of how the cycles work here.  But we have, in particular with home standby, we have the dramatic increase cycles where you have these step functions up, then growth kind of levels off, comes off of the peak actually, comes down off of a peak and normalizes to a baseline level, a new baseline level that's materially higher than the previous baseline level. And then, you kind of – as you increase awareness and distribution then you are ready for the next step up in growth. So it's more of a step function grower. We'll have to review the long-term targets. We are not prepared to update them this morning. But we are going to have – we'll have another Investor Day next year for sure, if not before then in terms of updating the long-range guidance.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mike Harris for any closing remarks.
Michael Harris : We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and [Audio Gap] in mid-February. Thank you again and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-03 10:00:00) =====

I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were very strong with robust revenue growth, significant sequential margin expansion and all-time records in net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Shipments of home standby generators and global C&I products outperformed our previous expectations, primarily driven by continued progress on our capacity expansion and our team's ability to effectively manage the challenging supply chain environment.  Growth in adjusted EBITDA margins were also ahead of our expectations in the quarter, reinforcing our prior forecast of margins bottoming in the first quarter. Gross margins benefited from favorable product mix, largely driven by home standby generators. These dynamics drove adjusted EBITDA margin outperformance and sequential margin expansion, combined with impressive top line growth, resulted in an all-time quarterly record for adjusted EBITDA dollars.  Positive underlying demand trends led to continued backlog strength with C&I products and home standby backlog, both providing us with considerable visibility for the quarters ahead. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 40% to $1.29 billion and grew sequentially from the first quarter of 2022, which was the previous all-time record. Strong momentum in core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, continued in the quarter with 33% growth over the prior year.  Overall, residential sales growth was again very robust, driven by a substantial increase in shipments of home standby generators as well as the impact from recent acquisitions. The C&I sales increase was broad-based, led by growth across all channels domestically, all regions internationally and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded sequentially from 17.3% in the first quarter to 21% due to improved price realization and the moderation of input costs.  Importantly, we expect growing realization of previously announced price increases in the second half of the year, further execution on cost reduction projects and continued easing of input cost headwinds resulting in sequentially improving margins over the remainder of the year.  Now discussing our second quarter results in more detail. Shipments of home standby generators grew at an exceptionally strong rate over the prior year. Growth also accelerated sequentially from the first quarter as we continued to expand production and power outage activity in the U.S. as measured on a rolling 4-quarter basis at the end of the second quarter remained above the long-term baseline average. In addition to elevated baseline outage activity in the U.S., severe storms left more than 1 million utility customers without power in Ontario and Quebec in May, which resulted in robust leading indicators of demand in Canada as well.  Power grid stresses are expected to persist, with forecasts for the upcoming hurricane season pointing to another year of above-average activity and multiple grid operators warning of potential outages as a result of excessive demand coinciding with supply challenges. Home consultations or sales leads continue to point to strong underlying demand for home standby generators, growing at a mid-teens rate despite a prior -- a strong prior year comparable period driven by the Texas winter storm event in February of 2021. This demand was broad-based, with 4 or 5 regions experiencing year-over-year growth in home consultations in the quarter.  To frame just how much home standby baseline demand has grown over the last several years, second quarter home consultations were more than 4x greater than pre-COVID levels seen in the second quarter of 2019. Importantly, strength in this leading market indicator has continued here in the month of July. In addition, activations, which are a proxy for installs, continued to grow at a solid rate in the second quarter compared to the prior year, led by the South Central and Midwest regions as we further added to our residential dealer base as we ended the quarter with approximately 8,200 dealer partners.  We continue to make excellent progress increasing our production levels for home standby generators, with daily build rates dramatically higher as compared to prior year levels and ramping sequentially as our Trenton, South Carolina facility continues to expand capacity. As we have increased build rates, lead times have continued to improve, and we are getting product in the hands of our customers and channel partners in a more consistent and a more timely basis.  As a result of this progress, close rates on our sales leads have begun to improve, supporting our belief that reducing our lead times will improve our ability to capture more of the new and higher baseline of home consultations or sales leads within our sales pipeline. Our build rates and supply chain challenges have been the main growth constraint for the home standby category over the last few years. We have now ramped production capacity to the point that our lead times for the product category have materially improved.  However, the constraint has now shifted to the installation capacity of our dealer base, driven primarily by contractor labor availability, permitting and utility-related delays and shortages in certain materials needed to complete an installation. As a result, project lead times for homeowners, as measured by the time between the signed contract and the installation date, have not come down in proportion with our production lead times.  We have a number of initiatives focused on increasing installation bandwidth in the market, including aggressive campaigns to add new dealers to our network, cultivate and train non-dealer contractors on home standby installations and decrease the overall time associated with the project. Additionally, as housing construction activity begins to slow, we believe we have a greater ability to focus installing contractors on improving the pace of home standby installations.  I'd now like to discuss our increasingly diverse suite of clean energy products and solutions. With the closing and integration of the ecobee acquisition, and given the growing commercial sales synergies and cross-functional initiatives between residential energy storage and microinverters, monitoring and management devices and grid services solutions, we now have one of the broadest portfolios of clean energy products and solutions in the industry.  Net sales from these combined clean energy products grew well over 50% on an as-reported basis in the second quarter over the prior year. Macroeconomic uncertainty, input cost pressures, industry-wide supply chain and logistics challenges and lack of clarity around regulatory policy have impacted residential clean energy markets as of late. But rising prices for traditional energy sources and a growing focus on energy independence and security have the potential to more than offset these concerns and continue to drive adoption of alternative and emerging solutions over time.  Additionally, we're very encouraged by last week's announcement of the Inflation Reduction Act as a potential positive catalyst for demand, although it's still not fully through the legislative process. As we work to capture this demand, our residential clean energy installer network continues to grow as we ended the second quarter with approximately 2,800 trained and certified technicians, with approximately 1,150 registered dealers on our PowerPlay sales platform.  We remain excited about the new and innovative products we're bringing to market in 2022, including the recent product launch of PWRmanager and the pending launches of our PWRgenerator, which is the industry's only engine-driven battery charger, an AC coupling solution for our PWRcell storage product for use in retrofit applications and our new PV microinverter product called the PWRmicro. As expected, we began shipping PWRmicros for beta testing in June and are now working to expand beta testing with full commercial launch expected in the fourth quarter.  I'd now like to provide a quick update on ecobee. Integration is proceeding as planned, and we continue to make good progress in developing cross-selling opportunities for ecobee's hardware solutions through Generac's distribution partners. The ecobee team successfully launched 2 new thermostats with industry-leading features during the quarter. And high temperatures and rising energy costs across North America are driving increased interest in the smart thermostat category. Early reception on these new products has been encouraging, reinforcing ecobee's differentiated competitive position ,focused on intelligent, intuitive, feature-rich devices that maintain comfort while unlocking significant value creation and energy conservation for homeowners and grid operators.  This differentiation also drives significant market opportunity for ecobee's energy services offering, which has been further enhanced by synergies with Generac's grid services efforts. ecobee's installed base of more than 2 million connected homes is particularly valuable to grid operators seeking load flexibility and resilience. Consumer awareness of elevated energy market volatility is also driving potential growth for recurring services revenue as ecobee enables consumers to take advantage of variable rate pricing structures.  Additionally, we are beginning to leverage the amazing talent within the ecobee team to help accelerate the development of our residential energy ecosystem, a key element of our connected devices strategy.  Now expanding a bit more on Generac Grid Services, the team continues to drive momentum in its increasingly impressive and diverse sales pipeline, building on the recent success across software-as-a-service, turnkey and performance contracts as well as experiencing an increasing mix of hardware sales, which are proving to be a competitive differentiator for our Grid Services business.  From distributed generation and storage to load flexibility assets, our grid services suite of solutions is unmatched in the market. We announced a number of recent contract wins since our first quarter call that highlighted our expanding capabilities, including EV charging, monitoring and optimization, a turnkey program for low- and moderate-income households utilizing PWRcell energy storage systems and a unique solution for the German power market.  Utilities and grid operators continue to warn of potentially significant disruptions to the power grid as a result of supply/demand imbalances, underscoring the need for new technologies to decentralize and digitize the power grid through the development of virtual power plants or VPPs. As an example, this need was on full display during the recent heatwave in Texas, as a number of home standby generators enrolled in the VPP program were autonomously controlled by our Concerto software platform to take demand off the grid and help keep critical community resources online.  The market opportunity for residential energy storage and microinverters, monitoring and management devices and grid services solutions remains extremely compelling and we believe will prove to be a key long-term future growth driver for Generac. For the full year 2022, we expect net sales of these clean energy products and solutions to approximately double from the prior year to more than $500 million in sales, with strong core and inorganic growth contributions and an even larger opportunity in the years ahead.  Now let me make some comments on our C&I products, which also grew at a strong rate in the second quarter across nearly all end markets and geographies. Specifically, global C&I net sales increased 22% on an as-reported basis and 16% on a core basis as compared to the prior year. Strong growth in net sales for domestic C&I products in the second quarter was led by national rental equipment and telecom customers as well as our North American distributor channel.  We saw continued strength in demand during the quarter, which contributed to a further increase in our backlog for C&I products and supports our expectations for solid growth to continue in the category. Shipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel also grew significantly in the second quarter, and improving close rates helped drive growth in orders and backlog in this channel. Strong momentum in quoting activity has continued as of late, highlighting the sustainability of demand trends for backup power for C&I applications.  Shipments to national telecom customers increased again during the second quarter as compared to the prior year as several of our larger telecom customers further invest in hardening their existing LTE sites and begin to build out their fifth generation or 5G networks. Telecom infrastructure upgrades remain one of the key megatrends we expect to drive growth for our business in the coming years.  We also experienced substantial growth with our national and independent rental equipment customers during the quarter. These customers have been investing heavily in equipment to refresh and expand their fleets, to serve increased commercial construction activity as well as other infrastructure projects, supporting a resilient demand environment for mobile products and the megatrend of the critical need for infrastructure improvements.  We also continue to see material traction in orders for Off Grid Energy's mobile energy storage systems from our key North American rental channel partners as they work to reduce the carbon footprint of their equipment fleets. Momentum remains strong across our domestic C&I channels and is being supplemented by emerging capabilities that support the long-term growth profile of the category. Specifically, we're establishing a strong reputation and applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects, driven by our ability to deliver customized turnkey solutions to serve this market.  Our unique hardware and software portfolio in this vertical is highlighted by expanding smart grid-ready features that allow connection to grid services programs. Large C&I generators can provide enhanced resiliency and stability for grid operators while simultaneously providing a tangible and meaningfully improved return on investment for the asset owners, which is driving demand for these solutions across a diverse range of customers.  Strong momentum also continued in our international segment, with total sales increasing 43% year-over-year during the second quarter, with 34% core sales growth when excluding the benefit of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. The core sales growth was driven by strength across all regions, most notably in Europe and Latin America. The European region has seen strong demand across product lines as the heightened focus on energy independence and security that emerged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine has continued. But longer-term implications are uncertain as geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions in the region remain volatile.  International energy security concerns are not unique to Europe, and we are evaluating additional opportunities for home standby generators across multiple regions as a result. External sales in the Latin American region continued to grow at a solid rate, while intersegment sales grew substantially as our Generac Mexico operations continue to ramp production of telecom products for the North American market.  In addition to strong core growth, our recent international acquisitions, Deep Sea Electronics and Off Grid Energy reported impressive results in the second quarter. Demand for Off Grid Energy's mobile storage systems continues to grow across our global distribution footprint as we integrate the product offering through our commercial sales branches and channels. In addition, we have several product development projects underway within the C&I energy storage category, including expansion of the power capacity range of the mobile product lineup as well as potential stationary applications.  Concerns around power security and energy prices in key international markets underpin the opportunity for an increasingly broad storage product portfolio for C&I applications. Deep Sea also benefited from healthy global demand for advanced generator controls during the quarter. And we remain very excited about the additional engineering capabilities Deep Sea brings as we leverage the team's electronics controls expertise to advance product road maps across our enterprise.  Our international segment has also experienced much stronger profitability despite inflationary headwinds and supply chain challenges. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margins expanded to 14.5% from 9.7% in the prior year period due to the accretive margin profiles of the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions, improved overhead absorption and better operating leverage on significantly higher volumes.  In closing this morning, I'm extremely proud of our team's continued ability to deliver record results and maintain our 2022 outlook despite the developing uncertain economic environment. Our strong sequential margin improvement reinforces our expectation that margins bottomed in the first quarter of 2022 and will continue to improve throughout this year. Additionally, our recent refinancing has provided further liquidity to accelerate our evolution into an energy technology solutions company.  We remain focused on executing against our Powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy, and the megatrends supporting this strategy are as compelling as ever, many of which have the potential to decouple from the broader macroeconomic environment. Structural supply-demand imbalances facing the grid are not impacted by inflation, and increasingly severe and volatile weather cannot be slowed by higher interest rates.  The energy ecosystems that we are building for the future will give our end customers the ability to take control of their power security, lower their energy bills and reduce energy consumption while also helping utilities and grid operators to balance supply and demand. With our broad portfolio of products and solutions, combined with our services, our distribution, our brand and importantly, our expertise, Generac is uniquely positioned to lead the evolution to a more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy future.  I now want to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our second quarter 2022 results and our outlook for the year. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at second quarter 2022 results in more detail, net sales increased 40% to $1.29 billion during the second quarter of 2022, another all-time record, as compared to $920 million in the prior year's second quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 7% impact on revenue growth during the quarter.  Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the second quarter by product class, residential product sales grew to $896 million as compared to $600 million in the prior year, representing a 49% increase despite a strong prior year comparable. Contributions from our clean energy acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 7% of revenue growth for the quarter. Home standby generator sales made up the vast majority of the residential product core sales growth, increasing by more than 50% over the prior year as we continue to expand production capacity for these products.  Commercial and industrial product net sales for the second quarter of 2022 increased 22% to $309 million as compared to $254 million in the prior-year quarter. Contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency had a net impact of approximately 6% on net sales growth during the quarter. The strong core revenue growth was broad-based, driven by growth across all regions globally and all channels domestically.  Net sales for other products and services increased 31% to $86 million as compared to $66 million in the second quarter of 2021. Contributions from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 13% of this revenue growth during the quarter. Strength in aftermarket service parts continues to be a key driver of the core sales growth in this category due to a larger and growing installed base of our products in the field, which is also leading to higher levels of extended warranty revenue. Also contributing to the increase was continued growth in our services offering in certain parts of our business.  Gross profit margin was 35.4% compared to 36.9% in the prior-year second quarter as the challenging supply chain and overall inflationary environment drove higher input costs during the quarter. Specifically, the lagging impact of elevated commodity prices and other surcharges, higher inbound logistics and expediting costs, increased labor rates, and continued plant ramp-up costs all pressured margins relative to the prior-year quarter.  The increasing realization of multiple pricing actions previously implemented and favorable sales mix partially offset these higher input costs. We're very encouraged that gross margins expanded 360 basis points on a sequential basis as pricing benefits increased and input costs began to ease during the second quarter, reinforcing our expectation that margins have bottomed in the first quarter.  Operating expenses increased $83 million or 53% as compared to the second quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily driven by higher recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions and an increase in intangible amortization expense. Higher employee costs and additional variable expenses from the significant increase in sales volumes also contributed to the increase. Operating expenses, excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of revenue, increased approximately 75 basis points as compared to the prior year period due to the impact of recent acquisitions that have a higher operating expense load relative to sales as those businesses scale for future growth.  Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest as defined in our earnings release was an all-time record $271 million or 21% of net sales in the second quarter as compared to $218 million or 23.7% of net sales in the prior year. The decline in EBITDA margin versus prior year was driven by the previously discussed decline in gross margins and higher operating expenses. But again, we're very pleased with the 370 basis point sequential improvement in EBITDA margins relative to Q1 2022.  I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 42% to $1.13 billion in the quarter as compared to $793 million in the prior year, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 6% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $242 million, representing a 21.5% margin as compared to $204 million in the prior year or 25.7% of net sales. The lower domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to higher input costs and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the increasing realization of previously implemented pricing actions and favorable sales mix.  International segment total sales, including intersegment sales, increased 43% to $203 million in the quarter as compared to $142 million in the prior-year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 34% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests was $29.5 million or 14.5% of net sales as compared to $13.7 million or 9.7% of net sales in the prior year. The significant expansion in international EBITDA margins was primarily due to strong margin contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and improved overhead absorption and operating leverage on significantly higher sales volumes.  Now switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2022 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $156 million as compared to $127 million for the second quarter of 2021. GAAP income taxes during the current year quarter were $45.8 million or an effective tax rate of 22.5% as compared to $46.4 million or an effective tax rate of 26.6% for the prior year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to a discrete tax item in the prior-year quarter, resulting from a legislative tax rate change in a foreign jurisdiction that unfavorably revalue deferred tax liabilities by $7 million, which had an approximate 4% tax rate impact to the prior-year quarter.  Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.21 in the second quarter of 2022 compared to $2.01 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $194 million in the current year quarter or $2.99 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $153 million in the prior year or $2.39 per share. Recall from last quarter, and as disclosed in our reconciliation schedules in our earnings release, our adjusted net income and EPS for the current year no longer adjust for cash taxes due to the expiration of our significant tax shield that originated from our LBO transaction in 2006.  Cash flow from operations was $24 million as compared to $123 million in the prior-year second quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $6 million as compared to $96 million in the same quarter last year. The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a much higher working capital investment in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher operating earnings. Inventory levels stabilized in the second quarter, so the higher working capital investment during the current year quarter was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable, given sequential sales growth and a reduction in accounts payable as we optimize inventory levels and purchasing patterns. We expect free cash flow conversion to return to the historical long-term average in the second half of 2022, resulting in approximately 90% conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow.  We significantly enhanced our liquidity profile in the second quarter with the amendment of our existing credit facilities. This included establishing a new term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million and a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion, which was unfunded at closing. Proceeds from the $750 million new term loan were used to prepay $250 million of the existing term loan B facility and to fully pay off the existing ABL revolving credit facility, which had $285 million outstanding at closing, with the remaining funds added to the balance sheet to be used for general corporate purposes.  Our new term loan A and revolving credit facility mature in June 2027. These new debt facilities will initially bear interest at SOFR plus 150 basis points through the end of 2022. And beginning on January 1, 2023, the applicable spread will range from 125 to 175 basis points, based on the company's total leverage ratio. Additionally, our existing term loan B does not mature until December 2026. We do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date, and it has a low cost of SOFR plus 175 basis points.  We also maintained our interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $1.72 billion of liquidity, comprised of $467 million of cash on hand and $1.25 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.37 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter of only 1.5x on an as-reported basis.  Before discussing outlook, I want to highlight that we've been repurchasing our shares opportunistically thus far in the third quarter. In fact, we have exhausted the remaining $124 million of share repurchase authorization that existed as of the end of the second quarter. As a result, on July 29, 2022, the company's Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock over a 24-month period.  With that, I will now provide further comments on our outlook for 2022. As Aaron previously discussed, we are maintaining our sales growth and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for the full year 2022. We continue to expect net sales to increase between 36% to 40% as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis, which includes an approximate 4% to 7% net impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This revenue outlook still assumes shipments of residential products increase at a mid- to high 40% rate during 2022. And revenue for C&I products is still expected to grow at a high teens rate compared to the prior year.  Looking at seasonality for the second half of the year. Revenue is expected to increase sequentially in both the third and fourth quarters, continuing the strong double-digit year-over-year growth trends, with fourth quarter sales levels up more modestly above the third quarter. Looking at our gross margin profile. As discussed, we expect that margins have bottomed in the first quarter. We continue to expect fourth quarter gross margins to recover back to first quarter 2021 levels in the 40% range, driven by increasing price realization, continued easing of inflationary pressures through the remainder of the year and further materialization of cost reduction benefits. This would result in gross margin percent for the full year 2022, to be approximately in line with 2021 levels, which is consistent with our previous expectations.  Operating expenses as a percent of sales, excluding amortization expense, for the full year 2022 are still expected to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to full year 2021, primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions that have a higher operating expense load relative to sales as they continue to invest for future growth.  Adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are still expected to be approximately 21.5% to 22.5% for the full year. From a seasonality perspective, adjusted EBITDA margins are projected to improve sequentially in the second half, primarily driven by improving gross margins as previously discussed, with fourth quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA margins approaching 26%.  Several additional guidance -- themes that we provide to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow require updating for the full year 2022. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 24% for the remaining quarters of the year, resulting in a full year 2022 GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 23%.  For full year 2022, we now expect interest expense to be approximately $52 million to $54 million, an increase from the previous guidance of $42 million to $44 million, reflecting our updated capital structure due to the refinancing of our credit facilities in June 2022. In addition, we have updated our interest rate assumptions to reflect the latest market expectations for SOFR in the second half of 2022. This assumes no additional changes in outstanding debt for the remainder of the year. Depreciation expense is still expected to be approximately $54 million to $56 million in 2022, given our assumed CapEx guidance. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2022 is now expected to be approximately $100 million to $105 million as compared to our previous guidance of the high end of the $95 million to $100 million range. Stock comp expense is still expected to be between $32 million to $34 million for the year.  Our full-year weighted average diluted share count is now expected to be in the low -- at the low end of the previous guidance range of approximately 65 million to 65.5 million shares, given our share repurchase activity in July 2022. Our capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately 2.5% to 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. And as previously mentioned, free cash flow conversion is expected to return to historical norms of approximately 90% in the second half of the year. Finally, this 2022 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value.  This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Michael Halloran of Baird.
Michael Halloran: So there's a lot of great content in there. Could you just help me triangulate with something? You're talking about backlogs that are starting to be filled, lead times coming down, at the same time, really good IHC consultations and you feel pretty good about the underlying demand environment. So could you maybe give some context to what that backlog bleed has looked like or what the inventory lead times look like? And maybe put that in context for the visibility that you have, how far out that tracks relative to a typical time line?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Mike, this is Aaron. Yes, the lead times have come down now, on average, we're talking home standby category here, 8 to 10 weeks, which, again, is, I think, directly the result of our actions in increasing production and was always part of the plan, as we've talked.  What we're really encouraged by and what continues to pace ahead of kind of expectations here is the front-end kind of lead generation, the end market. I think there are a couple of catalysts there that we can point to that, I think, are probably at work.  The first would be the summer season here has come with it a number of high-profile kind of warnings, if you will, from utilities and grid operators about the potential for outages on shortfalls in supply, I mean, just raw supply not being enough to meet demand. So that's kind of 1 catalyst that's new this year.  A second one, obviously, we got a very aggressive forecast again here for hurricane season. It's been quiet so far but the season forecast was well above average. And then the third thing I would point to as a catalyst for why we think the end market is still very active in the category is really around this outage that happened in Canada. We don't talk about Canada as much as we probably should. It's a great market for us. It always has been. We have over 500 dealers up there.  It's actually -- it's a great market because from a demographic standpoint, fits quite well with the buyers of the category. But they suffered a pretty high-profile outage of 1 million utility customers in Ontario and Quebec about 1.5 months ago, it was. And that really has -- jumps off the page when you look at it in our statistics when we track by region.  We actually track some -- just a lot of data really down to the zip code level in areas. But it's interesting to see how much of an impact that had for us in that part of the world. So I would point to those things, again, end market demand very strong, but we continue to ramp production to bring that -- the lead times on the category down.
Michael Halloran: The backlog part of that question then, Aaron? Where is the backlog rough and tough? And then maybe some thoughts on how far that visibility stretches out for you at this point?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. We've always said home standby visibility, usually, it's not very good, right, because we typically don't have a backlog. We've been in a backlog situation now for close to 2 years as we've been working to ramp production and tackle these supply chain challenges, which we've been doing. That backlog is still significant.  And in fact, we -- as we have said previously, we still expect to have a backlog by the time we exit this year. So even though we've got our ramp ongoing in production output, we're still not going to catch that by the end of the year. And we'll continue to bring the lead times down, but the backlog is still significant for home standby.
Operator: And your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So let me just come back to the gross margin question. Obviously, you guys reaffirming here the outlook and troughing off 1Q. Can you comment a little bit about some of the input cost reductions flowing through? How much latitude should that provide you as you look forward going into your longer-term outlook, '23-'24, et cetera? How much is that going to cascade? And also, can you speak a little bit more about repricing the backlog, the success and perhaps pricing trajectory given some of the moderation in the cost input here?
York Ragen: Yes, Julien, this is York. So we posted 35.4% gross margins in the second quarter. Very pleased with the sequential improvement off of Q1. And we are starting to see pricing read through. You mentioned repricing of the backlog. We did announce a price increase in April that repriced the backlog as of June 1. We still have some additional pricing that launched late last year that will flow through backlog into Q3.  But as our prepared comments said, if -- we posted 35.4% gross margin in Q2. Expect then to get closer to 40% by the end of the year. As we ramp that, what is that, 4% to 5% increase, about half of that sequential increase will be about -- half of that will be pricing, price realization continuing to come through, the other half being moderation of input costs.  When you look at commodities starting to roll over, we'll start -- we'll see the lagging impact of that. There's always a lag in our realization. As commodities move, there's always a lag. We'll start seeing some of that here in the latter part of the year. We're seeing inbound freight costs come down. Some of our expediting costs are coming down. Just getting our plants' absorption improve. We do have a number of just cost-out projects. We're working on our build and material of our products that will materialize in the second half. So all that supports and gets us comfortable with that progression of sequential margin improvement to the point where when we exit 2022 here, we'll feel very comfortable with our margin profiles, again back to where they were early part of 2021 before all this inflationary pressures happened.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, yes. It sounds like maybe there's even more latitude there as you continue to compound with some of these benefits. But maybe just if I can pivot quickly, I know you said high teens for C&I. Just with respect to that business and obviously, there's a litany of reasons why you should continue to see some of that input. How is that trajectory going today? And how much is that helping some of the backlog commentary here to just continue to keep that at a robust level? I know that, obviously, the backlog here is normalizing for some of the factors from last year. But can you comment a little bit on C&I here and how that could complement the backlog?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Julien, this is Aaron. The C&I business is -- we don't spend enough time talking about that business. It's a really great solid business that has been growing quite nicely and is really the benefactor of many of these megatrends we've been talking about. C&I products in particular, in a couple of areas, and I'll point them out.  Telecom, the telecom market for us, we are a significant share player in that telecom market. We supply all the major Tier 1 carriers here in the U.S. and many of the secondary and tertiary players as well. We have a diverse offering of product. We engineer and design specific solutions for specific network applications. So a lot of these gen-sets, you would think they're standard products and they are, but they're specific to a particular customer's network. So we'll customize around the needs of each network, which are different.  So that's 1 trend. And obviously, as the telecom companies are spending a lot of CapEx to harden their networks and build out the fifth generation networks, that -- we're benefiting from that trend and we think that, that will continue for the next several years at the very least.  The other 1 is in the rental space, the rental channel partners that we have, they're all re-fleeting. So they kind of went through a process after -- through the COVID cycle down where they reduced their purchases, obviously, with the uncertainty on what might happen. And then as the economy began to really come to life, as a result of a lot of the stimulus spending, they found themselves with fleets that were aged or undersized for the market requirements.  So we're a leader in -- when it comes to power generation, temporary lighting, temporary dewatering, heating, those types of applications. We've got a great product assortment that we sell to, again, all the major rental accounts. And that has been a -- that's proven to be a really great business.  And then just 1 other point I'll make, the International side of C&I. Most of our International business is C&I. We do have a nice growing residential business in there and we don't talk a lot about that, but we're seeing home standby activations around the globe, which is, I think, an indication of some of the power security issues that exist not only here in the U.S. but certainly everywhere.  But internationally, that business has done just incredibly well, and they've been doing well for several quarters now. And that's on the back of some of the energy security issues in Europe. But just, again, power security in general, whether you're talking about the conflict, the Russia-Ukraine conflict or whether you're talking about challenges in other parts of the world, we need power. We need a continuous source of power, and backup generation is going to be in demand for a long time. So that C&I business is great. Book-to-bill was positive in the quarter and backlog grew again.
Operator: And your next question is from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners.
Philip Shen: So some of our checks suggest that lead flow has dropped in -- certainly in some regions. I think some regions have a healthy lead flow but others are a little bit down, some of the lead flow might be down 25%, 40% from maybe 4 or 5 months ago. Can you talk about how that might serve as a leading indicator at all? I know you were talking about healthy IHCs, but lead flow at some level is -- precede that.  And then if you can touch on lead flow for the solar business as well. To what extent are -- when you kick -- when you started the solar business or when you're early into it, generating lead flow was a key point of differentiation. Where does that stand with your ability to create value for your dealers and so forth?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Phil. I'll unpack that here with a lot of it around -- or all of it around leads. Let's talk a little bit about home standby leads. Four out of 5 regions, they were up quarter-over-quarter and up big in some regions. The only region we saw a pullback was in the South Central region and that's Texas. Texas is the -- you take that February 2021 winter event out there.  And that's where if you are doing channel checks, you may find in Texas, I mean, they were so high a year ago. In fact, I would just point out that when we look at all of our states, just individual states, Texas was still the top state on just an absolute basis for us in the quarter. So even though the South Central region was off as a region and Texas off big within that region, actually, on an absolute basis, the number of leads we generated in Texas was the highest of any of the 50 states.  So I would think that if you're doing channel checks, that's the only region, at least based on our data. I think as we said before, we're really pleased to see the kind of the lead activity because it's just -- it's such a great barometer of the market activity that is to come. We've proven this out. We've been tracking sales leads for almost 10 years now, and it's a pretty solid, reliable predictor of volumes in the future. So it's a great leading indicator.  Specifically to the clean energy business with leads, yes, as you indicated, that is and has been a differentiator for us vis-à-vis others in the marketplace. And it's really been helpful for us to help court new channel partners and new dealers. Giving those leads to customers in a market like the solar market, as a for instance, they historically has had very high customer acquisition costs, I think, is -- I think, again, it's an area that we excel at based on our experiences with it, and our channel partners are coming to find the real value in that.  That said, I think there's even more that we can do there as we dial in kind of how we go to market with our messaging. And that's everything from the type of media that we buy to the regions and particular markets that we target. But we've enjoyed some pretty good success out of that early on here in terms of the clean energy business.
Philip Shen: Great. As it relates to backlog, we've talked about it a bit already, but some of our conversations with dealers suggest the 22- and 24-kilowatt are basically caught up. Basically, it's like a 1- to 2-week lead time. And so you can kind of get it when you need it. It seems like the long lead time generators are the liquid-cooled ones. And so I was wondering if that's true.  And then also in your backlog, to what degree have you received cancellations in your backlog? Were there -- because some of the people we've talked to, they are full in terms of inventory and they just don't need as much, given the situation. So just wondering if you're seeing any of that.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. On the backlog -- on the lead time question, I'll hit that here first. The category, it's about 8 to 10 weeks and that's air-cooled and liquid-cooled products. That's obviously average for the weighting of each of those products within there. We have certain SKUs where we're obviously -- we're performing better than that average and certain SKUs where we're longer. It depends on sometimes component supply challenges.  We have, as an example, we're launching the 26-kilowatt product here this month. And so that's been sitting in backlog. So those lead times look particularly long. And we have some other products within the air-cooled family, where either we have component shortages or other constraints that have manifested. And in the liquid-cooled side, that demand has been incredibly robust with liquid-cooled. And our ability to increase production output there has been a bit hampered by supply chain. So working to bring all of those lead times down.  And again, we've been speaking -- when we talk about lead times, we've been talking about the averages, and that's the average number of weeks of orders in backlog. And I think that's an important distinction, because when you talk to dealers, you're going to find different dealers are in different places, right? Some dealers are -- they can't get enough product, right? They'll take more product if we can get it to them. They either have the space or the financial capacity to do that.  You have other dealers, maybe don't, right? In particular, as you get into smaller dealerships. They don't typically have a warehouse so they run out of space more quickly. They don't typically have the financial capacity, right? A lot of times, they're paying with a credit card even in some cases.  And in the prepared remarks, I spoke to the fact that installation bandwidth, in particular, when you look at the smaller end of the dealer spectrum, they're struggling to find labor. They're struggling with some components that they need, things like propane tanks and other things. They're struggling with permitting delays or getting a utility to come out, to pull a meter or upgrade a meter. Those things are all starting to manifest themselves.  As we've kind of brought our output levels up to a significantly higher level year-over-year, now you're starting to see the constraints kind of move kind of downstream, if you will. And that's exactly what -- we're working with the channel partners to alleviate that, whether it's talking to individual AHJs about permitting issues or delays there or it's looking to -- we've even stood up. We've got HR efforts here to help hire contractors for our dealers or noncontractor labor for our dealers, depending on what their needs are. So kind of we're recruiting for our dealers.  And of course, we're bringing new dealers in all the time. We added another 100 dealers here this past quarter. We're now at 8,200 and we need more. That's something that we're working hard on. As far as cancellations, of course, we have -- our policy around orders has always been a pretty, I'll call it, a liberal policy that way. So the ability to cancel or defer an order is -- you'll see that in those smaller dealers that are coming up against some of those constraints as you point out.  I would say on balance, it's not a material number when you look at the total. But we work through that and it's kind of dealer by dealer. It's really kind of hand-to-hand combat down in the trenches in terms of working with the dealers on -- and again, this is where other programs are really, really helpful with -- our Wells Fargo program is a great program for dealers to stock product.  And so we encourage dealers if they're not already signed up on that platform, to get on that platform. That's a great way for them to be ready for the season. The last thing we want dealers to do is to not be ready for the season. And so that's the messaging that's going out in the field.
Operator: And your next question is from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. If we could just get into battery storage. I think you said there's some noise and I know there's a lot of supply chain issues. So just talk about what's going on in that business and what kind of your growth expectation or updated growth expectation is on that.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. That's great. Thanks, Jeff. Appreciate it. Yes, on storage particularly, yes, supply chain challenges have been numerous. In fact, I would say we hit our most challenging quarter with that here in Q2. And it was not really about cell supply. It was actually challenges in all the electronics components that go into this gear from microprocessors to FETs to everything that we use in the inverter, in the storage cabinet and the storage devices themselves. So that was challenging in the quarter and we're hoping here for the second half to be better in supply of those components.  Demand has remained strong. Again, when you look at IHCs, again, sales leads, we're seeing good strength in lead volume in clean energy. So -- and obviously, there's been a lot of noise around the regulatory environment. Are we going to have "Build Back Better?" Are we not? Now you've got the Inflation Reduction Act, which still has hurdles to clear legislatively, but that could be, obviously, a catalyst for additional demand, as we said in our prepared remarks.  Our position in storage, we still feel very good about our position there. But the supply chain has been a burden here in Q2. And so more to come on that. We've got, I think, a nice forecast here for the balance of the year. Our guidance -- I think when you think about just -- we've talked about this in the past. We have -- we've gone away from like trying to talk about discrete numbers of megawatts and everything else. I mean, that business is so much more diverse for us in terms of clean energy and all the things that kind of work together there from the energy monitoring and management to the grid services elements to -- we've got our power generators. We've got our power managers, our load management controls. There's just a lot of stuff there. So we didn't feel it was appropriate to just talk about a single metric.  So what we've said here and what our prepared remarks said is that we're anticipating that entire kind of complex of products and services that we refer to as clean energy, smart thermostats, everything and go into that now, to be in excess of $500 million for the full year, which is basically double what it was last year. So feeling really good about that business and where it's going in the future.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay, great. And then a lot of my companies have kind of built a lot of working capital into the first half. And with all the supply chain and demand, et cetera, just -- I don't know if you updated the free cash flow guide and how you think working capital is -- how big of a source it can be in the back half?
York Ragen: Yes. No, Jeff. This is York. We did say that looking at -- basically, our performance to date, where we're coming into the second half from a working capital standpoint, we like that. We saw inventories stabilize in the second quarter. With that, we should get back to a more normalized free cash flow conversion in the entirety of the second half of the year.  Recall, normal cash flow conversion for this business is around 90%. So it'll probably be more weighted towards into Q4. But when you look at the second half in totality, free cash flow conversion should improve and return back to normal free cash flow levels for this business.
Operator: And your next question is from Brian Drab of William Blair.
Brian Drab: On home standby, field rates, you mentioned are up significantly year-over-year, obviously. Can you quantify how much we're up year-over-year for second quarter build rates? And where is your capacity now relative to what you feel you need in that business?
York Ragen: Well, we did mention shipments were up over 50% for home standby, which is indicative of our build rates for this category.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Of our build rates. Yes, being free there. That's a good proxy for that.
York Ragen: Yes. No, I think our theoretical capacity, as we get Trenton up and running, and particularly another set of machine tooling here in the second quarter, that should -- basically, that gets us to what our projected capacity increases were expected to be. So it would -- and that actually even gives us room here from where we're at today to even surge, should we get a major event. So there's -- we're good from a capacity standpoint in terms of our expectations now.
Brian Drab: Okay. And is there anything you can tell us about the capacity expansion plans for the medium term? Are you -- I mean, are there -- is there another phase to capacity expansion coming over the next couple of years? Do you feel like you're going to need that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Well, there could be, Brian. We took the action last year of getting an additional machine, filling an order, even though we don't even have an address to deliver it to at this point. We'll kind of watch how the season plays out here. And if we do get the aggressive hurricane forecast that's been projected, none of that's in our guidance, obviously. So if that comes to fruition, we probably would need to find a home for that tooling.  Now it could be an expansion of our Trenton facility, which is expandable. We've talked about that. It could be another greenfield site. But we're kind of -- it's a little bit of a wait-and-see approach here to the market. But at some point, our belief in the category continuing to grow, there will be capacity adds that are needed at some point in the future.
Brian Drab: Okay. And then just lastly, you mentioned -- I mean, there's a lot of discussion on IHCs, obviously. Did you say specifically whether IHCs were up sequentially from first quarter to second quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I don't have that in front of me but we did not -- they were up, yes. Mike's pointing up. So yes, they were up sequentially. They've been on a tear here in Q2, specifically to the catalyst that I mentioned. But it's been -- we've been surprised by the robustness of the end market demand, to be very frank. I mean, it's something that has -- I think it speaks to how the category continues to move into more of a mainstream -- as more of a mainstream appliance, if you will, for homeowners.
York Ragen: In fact, they were up very nicely sequentially.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Sequentially, yes.
York Ragen: Very nice.
Operator: And our next question is from Mark Strouse of JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse: I might be splitting hairs here a little bit, but I wanted to come back to the installation constraints with -- you mentioned dealer labor and permitting and other components. Is it a function of the -- those conditions deteriorating since your last call? Or is it more so they're just not keeping up with your increased manufacturing output?
Aaron Jagdfeld: No, they are increasing. We said that activations increased actually year-over-year, so we are seeing installs increase. They're just not increasing at the same pace. So it's not a deterioration. It's more of a -- it's the pace is not increasing at the same rate proportionate to our output.
Mark Strouse: Okay, okay. That helps. And then just curious, within the home standby business for new construction, new homes, just curious what you're hearing from your partners within that channel.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Well, new home construction is slowing, but again, our IHCs are up. So we've always been only marginally exposed to new construction. That's -- I think it was something 10% to 15% of our total volume goes into that. So it's not a huge thing. It never really has been. In fact, we've always said that could be a nice opportunity area if we could get it to grow. And it has grown from kind of that 10% range to more like 15% now. But it's still -- it's kind of relative. I think it's mainly a retrofit category, kind of always has been. There's just a lot of housing stock out there in a lot of areas of the country that are struggling with power quality. So we don't really see -- and we're not hearing anything directly from channel partners about that. The only thing we do hear from them is that more home-builders want to offer the product as a feature, the potential -- not necessarily a standard feature but certainly as a feature to the people who are looking to build a home.
Operator: And your next question is from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Aaron, I wonder if we could just put a finer point around the order trends in standby. It sounds like based on your backlog comments, that net orders were about $200 million in the quarter compared to $500 million last quarter. Can you just comment on that? Because I know you look at it on a forward production basis when you quote lead times. And just put that into context for us because, obviously, a sharp pickup in-home consultations year-over-year. So would just love to get your thoughts on that disconnect if those numbers are right.
York Ragen: Jerry, this is York. We haven't necessarily talked orders historically. We are running up against tough comps on the order standpoint, just given the Texas outage last year. So comparing that and as well as some of the installed bandwidth comments that Aaron talked about. But I mean, you really have to look at the IHCs to really understand what's going on with the end market demand and having those up nicely year-over-year here in the quarter and up, what we said, what, 4x from...
Aaron Jagdfeld: Over 4x, yes.
York Ragen: Over 4x pre-pandemic levels. So the underlying demand for the category is still very, very strong. But comparing that order rate is -- versus priority is probably not the right metric.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And what we've seen is higher baseline post major outages. We've seen generally a 30% peak-to-trough decline as the second adopters, if you will, wind up installing gensets a year after the peak installation rate. Can you just talk about, based on your IHCs, how you feel like that might play out this year? I know we touched on it on the last quarter's call, but I'm wondering if you could expand on that, given we've got 1 more quarter of information across the board here.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Jerry, this is Aaron. Again, I think when you think of the category, I don't know the historical context if the right place to look. I mean, the category has changed dramatically over the last several years. And I think all of the major kind of trends that underlie the demand in the category and the strength that we're seeing, in particular in IHCs, we believe, are going to remain intact here for the foreseeable future.  So I think that -- frankly, I just think the world's changed, so to speak, whether it's work-from-home or whether it's -- so that's our Home as a Sanctuary trend or whether it's the power quality trends that continue to be front and center for homeowners. I mean, you have homeowners who -- they're buying the category today or at least shopping the category today because they're worried about a potential outage. The category used to be all about outages happening.  And it's still largely -- that's an important demand catalyst, but all the rhetoric and dialogue around utility companies struggling with raw supply, as we work to electrify everything, as we're decarbonizing the grid, all of this kind of rapid shift in how we produce energy and consume energy is exposing the -- just massive vulnerabilities in supply and demand balancing. And that is something that is, obviously, a catalyst for not just home standby generators but also C&I products, our clean energy products, our grid services products.  Those are all directly in line to benefit from just the sheer chaos that the grid has become. It's a patchwork quilt, to begin with, but now it's a quilt with a lot of holes in it. And you're talking about massive concerns by people about just keeping their lights on, keeping their families safe, their home, their properties safe, their business, their livelihood safe, all of these things operating. So I think it's just -- I don't know that you can compare it to kind of what has happened historically in any of those categories.
Operator: And your next question is from William Grippin of UBS.
William Grippin: Just a simple 1 here, but wondering if you could talk about some of the puts and takes on the sequential margin improvement in the Domestic segment. And specifically, to what extent any product discounting initiatives may have been an offset to that?
York Ragen: No. That -- I mean, pricing -- price realization is actually going up. There's, if anything, very limited promotion going on. I mean, there's always some just general underlying -- undercurrent of some minor promotions.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We have planned promotions that are there but...
York Ragen: But I mean, normally when we're not in a backlog situation, there's an ordinary course of promotions. But even when you're in backlog, you have some minor promotions going on. So sequentially, there's nothing going on there. And in fact, we've, obviously, raised price, repriced the backlog June 1. And I think partly maybe where you're going with that is did that price increase stick in the marketplace? And it did.
William Grippin: Got it. And just curious if you could quantify what the 8 to 10 weeks of backlog translates to in terms of value. I didn't hear you mention that on the call.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, we don't disclose that. That's why you didn't hear it.
Operator: And your next question is from Maheep Mandloi of Crédit Suisse.
Michael Harris: So Chris, yes, I think we'd probably go the next question.
Operator: And that question is from Kashy Harrison of Piper Sandler.
Kasope Harrison: Aaron, just wanted to revisit lead times just 1 more time. You mentioned that now you're in the high singles versus 20 weeks last update. I know you had mentioned last time that because capacity is increasing, the relative dollar per week of lead times is different from what it was last time. So I was wondering if you could just give us maybe a sense of how to think about that rate of change dollar per week this time versus last time, even if it's just, like, a general percentage number. And then maybe part and parcel of that, maybe just some thoughts around the length of time before these bottlenecks between the dealers and installs begin to clear along with the risks if the bottlenecks persist.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, those are great questions. I think it's also a good point that the -- and we've said this in the past, that as we increase our production rate, that the backlog, as we stated, weeks of orders is -- that grows, right, as the output grows per week.
York Ragen: We want to catch it.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And we want to catch it. I mean, yes, we think that -- as we said in our prepared remarks, 1 thing we are seeing is we're seeing improved close rates off of IHCs because we are bringing down lead times. So that's part of our overall strategy here is if you're a customer and you're shopping the category and even if you hear 8 to 10 weeks on a product, you might be -- you might kind of sit on the sidelines and see what happens, right?  And even worse, kind of getting to the second part of your question is if a channel partner or a dealer is quoting something longer because their bandwidth to install has got them kind of at a fixed rate that keeps the lead time longer. So that gap, as we pointed out, kind of grew in the second quarter because of the increase in our production output. And they increased activations or installs but not to the same level. So we're working with them to bring that inside. We're going to need more dealers. We're going to need more installing contractors.  We have a lot of initiatives around trying to make installations easier and less time-consuming. Today, an installation, a typical installation still takes 2 individuals, about 8 hours a piece, so about 16 hours of labor in the installation. So if we could get that down, that obviously frees up some additional bandwidth.  So that's where our focus has been. And again, it's dealer by dealer so it's not widespread, but we are seeing dealers struggle with that. In particular, dealers that are in markets where either housing has been really hot in certain markets. That's where they're really struggling with labor for construction labor, contractor labor. So as, again, part of our prepared remarks, as the housing market cools, we actually think that will help us refocus installing contractors' attention towards the category and will hopefully improve lead times to the end market.
Kasope Harrison: And just a quick follow-up there. So the high singles, would that be 50% more than last time on a per week basis? 75%? Double? Just any rough sense of how to think about it on a relative basis would be great.
Aaron Jagdfeld: No. I mean, again, it's -- we have to do the math. I don't have it in front of me.
York Ragen: We don't have a ratio.
Aaron Jagdfeld: I don't have a ratio like that put together. But I think lead times, we quoted last time were in the 20-week range. They're roughly half of that now, 8 to 10. But again, that 8 to 10 represents a greater amount. So in terms of our production output, so it's not half of what it was before. So to your point, I think that's the point you're trying to get to, I just don't have the math in front of me on that.
Operator: And your next question is from Praneeth Satish of Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish: I'm just trying to understand here with the constraints on the installer side. I mean, if there was some kind of major weather event in the second half of this year, what would be -- would you be in a position to benefit from that? Or would that be basically kind of adding to the '23 sales at this point?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean, as we've said before, if we -- today, the plan is we're going to probably exit the year with some backlog remaining. So that -- because of that, there's not a lot of room for upside for the storm. There hasn't been all year for HSB. We've got some room on portable generators. We're in a good inventory position there, ready to serve the market if there is an active storm season.  But on HSBs, and this is, again, why we're working with the channel to increase their installed capacity because we've got to get that to a higher level longer term. We've got to -- we have seen opportunities for that to expand. But the backdrop right now, what we're hearing from these contractors that are struggling is primarily labor, some components and then some permitting and utility-related delays.  So we're attacking all of those things. We've got a broad slate of initiatives to get after those things and have been here for the balance of this year because we kind of -- we could see this coming. We needed to see the installation rate pick up. And while it has increased, it just hasn't increased enough at this point.
York Ragen: And you'd have to ramp your supply chain up further as well.
Aaron Jagdfeld: That's a good point.
York Ragen: This challenging environment could limit that but definitely would help out 2023.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's a good point.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. And then just switching gears, can you give us an update on the Grid Services business? How many deals did you win in Q2? And are you seeing an acceleration in that side of the business with utility rates going up and utilities kind of looking for any way to lower their costs?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. That has been a really active space for us. Really pleased with the sales pipeline that's building there. The challenge, of course, in that business, and as we've said before, is just the time it takes to get these programs through, not only the utilities themselves in terms of developing the programs, but also then the regulators for approval.  So we have a couple of really nice wins that we will -- you'll see some announcements here in the weeks ahead on that are, I think, really are a good example, both of the wins that you'll see are really good examples of the power of the hardware plus software approach that we've taken here. And I think that, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're definitely beginning to see that there's a differentiator for us as a company, because we bring so much more to these potential programs by offering solutions that span everything from a smart thermostat program to a generator program to a battery program to a C&I generator program.  I mean, there's big chunks of load that come from C&I generators. And we can bring all of that hardware to bear alongside this really advanced software platform called Concerto that our team has developed. It's just -- it's a really interesting space going forward.  And to the point about utilities, we have seen a change in their attitudes over the last several months, several quarters really, in terms of the sense of urgency in which -- and they're asking questions and engaging with us. We were down in DISTRIBUTECH, which is kind of the utility markets trade show, if you will, down in Dallas a while ago, a couple of months ago. And I was struck by just the quality of the conversations, the quantity of the conversations we had with utilities and grid operators.  And they just feel like their back is against the wall. They can't solve their problems with traditional means, right? Like a traditional mean being if demand is going up because of more EV adoption in a particular market, a grid operator utility would simply have outlined a plan to add a gas peaker plant to cover those points in the curve where they need additional supply.  And so that's something that they can't do anymore. The regulators are saying, "Look, we're not going to allow you to add another thermal asset to your fleet for supply." And so they're finding themselves in the uncomfortable situation of having to -- it's kind of like a dual mandate. They have to decarbonize their grids because of that mandate, but the other mandate is they have to continue to provide resiliency. And so they're really struggling with ways to do that. So they have to have new tools in the toolkit.  And they see these virtual power plants and these distributed energy resources, like generators and batteries and load management and thermostats as ways to -- as really valuable ways to help them build out the additional supply or the reduction in demand that they need to provide the resiliency that they're charged with providing.
Operator: And your next question is from Donovan Schafer, Northland Capital Markets.
Donovan Schafer: This is Donovan Schafer. So it seems like there has been so much changing all over the world in the last few months. So I'm just wondering if we can step back and talk about some of this in terms of what it means for the megatrends you guys like to talk about.  So first, there's grid instability. But I do -- it does seem, on some, level, that in the United States, there are at least some bonafide grid investments with the Infrastructure Bill that was passed last year, plans to make it easier to permit transmission lines. It does seem like there's a bit of traction there. So on that front, I'm wondering if there are any risks or if there is any chance we could get kind of a reduced trend in outages, not near term but maybe say, 3 to 5 years out. I know MISO has been just recently approved, 18 high-voltage transmission lines to handle 53 gigawatts of capacity or something.  And then I also want to talk on the Russian situation. That does make the diesel to natural gas megatrends, certainly in Europe, to some people, look like a bad idea. I know you also sell diesel generators, so maybe you can kind of be agnostic there. But historically, the megatrend you've talked about has been the shift to natural gas.  And then kind of on the flip side, you've got growth in the LNG markets. Maybe that allows more HSB and natural gas generation elsewhere, increasing energy security concerns generally. I mean, nations like Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines really struggle with electricity generation, limited resources, having to import everything and they probably don't feel great about China right now. So those could be positive drivers.  So just I'm curious kind of, again, stepping back and looking at megatrends from these kind of big movements globally, we've been saying. Which ones are you watching? Which ones do you think -- which things do you think could really be material over a couple of years? Yes, any clarification on that would be very helpful.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Donovan, from a megatrend standpoint, the grid's a mess. And I don't -- there's nothing in the next 3 to 5 years. I mean, you can talk to any utility company, any utility executive or -- and while they'll get some transmission lines approved and a couple of other things going in the right direction, maybe that will light a fire under regulators.  But there's so much deferred -- if you just -- if you didn't have the Electrify Everything trend, if you just took that away for a second, and you dealt with the more severe climate experiences that we're having and just the decarbonization of the grid in general and that kind of generating fleet, those sources being -- they're moving to a more intermittent nature, and because the technologies have not kept up, like battery technology is just not there yet commercially to be a viable storage technique.  And that's really what we need. We need storage if we're going to move to 100% of our power being generated from renewable sources. You've got to have the ability to store that power at times when those renewables are not able to perform. This is a massive challenge that grid operators and utility executives are trying to solve for. There's no silver bullet there. There's no easy way to do it. There's no technologies that have -- that are presented that allow for that in a commercial way, in a cost-effective way, certainly. And there's nothing in the next 3 to 5 years.  And they would tell you that even if they had an approved plan, all the resources necessary to execute that approved plan, it would be decades just to execute against it. The buildout of the transmission lines, the upgrade of all the equipment that needs to happen to modernize the grid. It's -- there's trillions and trillions of dollars behind in deferred spending and just the raw effort to do that is decades in the making. So we don't see anything on that front.  On your question on natural gas versus diesel, I mean, our -- almost 100% of our business C&I-wise outside of the U.S. is diesel. There's a little bit of natural gas, as we've said. And we think that, that's a trend longer term that'll improve. Where the gas to debt -- the diesel and natural gas trends have been more -- much more prevalent is here in the U.S. and where we have a lot of gas available and that's not an issue.  And I do think even in Europe, they need gas. So whether it comes from Russia or whether it gets imported from other areas, they're not going to move away from pipelines. That -- they've got the infrastructure. They're going to get gas.
York Ragen: Still be an important part of...
Aaron Jagdfeld: They're not going to change how they heat. They're not going to change how they use gas for process. I mean, they need gas. So they'll get it from somewhere. It's probably going to be imported LNG coming into the countries. They need it.
York Ragen: And they may name natural gas as a clean...
Aaron Jagdfeld: And natural gas will be redesignated in Europe as a clean -- as a clean fuel, which is great. So I think longer term, we feel really confident in those trends. Maybe shorter term, there'll be some noise around that. But again, that business today is mostly diesel. So it's really not a today impact.  And then you're right, you've got other countries where there's opportunities for us. You mentioned a couple of countries in Asia that have -- they're islands, right? So they import, whether it's Japan or whether it's Taiwan, those are all areas where they import. And we do see LNG becoming an important fuel. And this is where I think the United States is in a really good spot here to be able to provide a path for countries that need that important fuel source, whether it's baseload power generation or process or for energy security. That's going to be something that I think is going to be a -- that's a trend that's going to continue long into the future. Natural gas is a fantastic energy resource. It's going to be part of our baseload power structure here as a global populous for a long time to come.
Operator: And our final question is from Maheep Mandloi of Crédit Suisse.
Maheep Mandloi: I hope you guys can year me?
York Ragen: Yes.
Maheep Mandloi: So that -- 2 or 3 answers. Just 2 quick ones. One, just on the backlog. It said more than $1 billion the last quarter. Is it somewhere in line with that range or different? And I had a separate follow-up.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Again, we've talked about 8 to 10 weeks of orders in the backlog and it's sizable. It's a big backlog. And we expect to still have backlog as we exit the year, even that's in spite of the increased production rate. So it's a sizable number. And we want to get that down because that's how -- we think that serving the market with shorter back -- with shorter lead times is really important to winning in the market, in particular, on those sales leads that we've talked about.  So that's a really important focus for us, Maheep, and we're going to continue to lean into that. And again, working on that installation bandwidth as well. But that 8 to 10 weeks is really how we would speak to the backlog.
Operator: And I would now like to turn the call back over to Mike Harris for any closing remarks.
Michael Harris: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2022 earnings results with you in early November. Thank you again, and goodbye.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-04 10:00:00) =====

I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We experienced another all-time record in shipments during the first quarter as net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were all ahead of our previous expectations. The revenue outperformance was primarily driven by continued progress on our capacity expansion plans and effective management of a challenging supply chain environment. This led to higher-than-expected shipments of home standby generators, PWRcell energy storage systems and C&I products globally. The higher revenues drove adjusted EBITDA dollars, which were also ahead of our prior expectations, despite elevated input costs resulting in lower-than-expected margins in the quarter. Demand for our products also exceeded our expectations for the quarter, resulting in an increase in overall backlog from the end of 2021, with the home standby backlog remaining significant and providing us with considerable visibility in the quarters ahead. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 41% to $1.14 billion and also grew sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2021, which was the previous all-time record. We continue to experience robust and broad-based growth across the business with each of our residential and C&I product classes and Domestic and International reporting segments, all growing at incredibly strong double-digit rates as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis. Strong momentum in core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, continued in the quarter with 33% growth over the prior year, led by our residential product category. Overall, residential sales growth was again driven by a substantial increase in shipments of both home standby generators and PWRcell energy storage systems as well as the impact from recent acquisitions. The C&I sales increase was led by our mobile and telecom channels domestically, growth across all regions internationally and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 17.3% were lower year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of higher input costs, driven by ongoing supply chain challenges in the overall inflationary environment. Partially offsetting those cost headwinds where the increasing impact of multiple pricing actions implemented over the past year, favorable sales mix and the early impact of product cost reduction initiatives. Importantly, we expect growing realization of the previously announced price increases as 2022 progresses as well as incremental favorable margin impacts from additional pricing actions, which were enacted during the second quarter, further execution on cost reduction projects and easing input cost headwinds, resulting in sequentially improving margins throughout the year. Now discussing our first quarter results in more detail. Shipments of home standby generators in the first quarter grew at an exceptionally strong rate over the prior year and continues to benefit from the convergence of multiple megatrends that have significantly increased consumer awareness for the category. Power outage activity as measured on a rolling four quarter basis at the end of the first quarter was approximately in line with the long-term baseline average. And early forecast for the upcoming hurricane season are pointing to another year of above-average activity. As discussed previously, home consultations faced a challenging comparison with the prior year due to the high-profile Texas winter storm event and several significant outages in other states in the first quarter of last year, but were in line with our expectations for the quarter. For some perspective, home consultations during the first quarter were nearly 3x higher than the levels seen in the first quarter of 2020, reinforcing our view that demand for the home standby category has once again achieved and held a new and higher baseline level. Activations, which are a proxy for installs, continued to grow at a solid rate compared to the prior year, led by the South Central and Midwest regions. We ended the quarter with over 8,100 residential dealers, an increase of more than 400 dealers over the past 12 months. We made better-than-expected progress increasing production levels for home standby generators as daily build rates at our Wisconsin facilities further increased over prior year levels and build rates continue to aggressively ramp sequentially at our new Trenton, South Carolina facility. Higher output levels are driving an important -- an improvement in lead times, which have been declining to approximately 20 weeks from the approximately 27 weeks at the end of 2021. Despite the ongoing improvements in build rates and lead times, home standby backlog remains well above $1 billion. While build rates are projected to further increase throughout the year, we still expect to carry a meaningful portion of this backlog into 2023 even without the benefit of a major outage event in our forecast. In response to higher inflationary pressures, we're also taking additional pricing actions in the home standby category in the second quarter, and we expect to realize the benefit of these additional increases primarily during the second half of 2022. New orders now reflect this higher pricing and orders in backlog will also see a price increase effective June 1. In addition to the several pricing actions we've taken, significant cost-reduction initiatives and moderating input costs are expected to further benefit margins for the product category moving forward. Our clean energy products contributed meaningfully to overall growth in the first quarter as shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems grew significantly from the prior year period as our team successfully navigated industry-wide supply chain and logistic challenge. Supporting this rapid growth is the continued build-out of our installer network as we ended the first quarter with more than 2,600 trained and certified dealers with approximately 1,100 registered on our PowerPlay sales platform. In response to rising input and expedited logistics costs, we have also recently implemented additional price increases for our clean energy products. In spite of policy-related uncertainty in the near term, we believe the megatrends and secular growth drivers underpinning consumer demand for residential clean energy solutions is as compelling as ever. We remain very optimistic about the new and innovative product offerings we're bringing to market in 2022, including our new PV microinverter product offering called the PWRmicro, which has continued to receive significant prelaunch interest from our channel partners. In addition, our recently launched PowerManager load control device has garnered positive feedback in the market. And we expect this industry-leading innovative product to further strengthen our position within the residential energy storage market. We are still expecting clean energy revenue growth well above 50% for the full-year with continued strength in PWRcell energy storage systems, along with contributions from the initial rollout of new products. I'd now like to provide a quick update on ecobee. We're seeing good progress in developing cross-selling opportunities for ecobee's hardware solutions with Generac's retail and wholesale partners. Longer term, we're pursuing opportunities with residential and clean energy dealers as well as working to leverage ecobee's existing HVAC dealer base to sell Generac products. In the smart thermostat product category, the ecobee brand resonates well with consumers, and we have exciting new product introductions coming here in the second quarter. Additionally, ecobee's dedicated energy services team has seen a number of wins with several utilities and grid operators, including a recently announced demand response program with a local utility provider in Colorado. This is a simple but important example of a program that can be replicated across the country, which allows for the adjustment of ecobee smart thermostats during periods of high demand, resulting in energy conservation, financial benefits for homeowners and improved grid stability. We're also seeing promising commercial developments between ecobee and Generac Grid Services with utilities having an increasing interest in ecobee's product offerings. The Generac Grid Services and ecobee sales teams are jointly bidding on projects. And this collaboration offers significant growth potential in a large and rapidly expanding market by leveraging ecobee's growing installed base of more than 2 million connected homes. Our ability to increase our share of the value stack of a Grid Services program is also improving the economics and payback for homeowners, which has the potential to improve demand for ecobee hardware as well as participation in Grid Services programs. Expanding a bit more on Generac Grid Services. The team is executing on its strategic vision and has an increasingly impressive and diverse sales pipeline that includes expanding the cross-selling of Generac equipment, along with other opportunities beyond Software-as-a-Service contracts, driven by our unique hardware plus software plus services value proposition. Generac Grid Services also experienced strong growth during the quarter in key metrics such as connected assets under management. And we signed and closed a number of important software-as-a-service, turnkey and performance contracts. In addition, a growing proportion of hardware orders, including home standby generators and PWRcell energy storage systems, along with other contracts in the final stages of negotiation, have improved our line of sight for a significant ramp in this business during 2022. Importantly, the Generac Grid Services team is making great progress integrating Generac products onto the Concerto software platform to create complete solutions for utilities and grid operators. We are excited about the economic and societal value of these opportunities as we work to facilitate the decentralization, the digitization and the decarbonization of the power grid. Now let me make some comments on our C&I products, which also grew rapidly in the first quarter with strength across multiple end markets and geographies. Specifically, global C&I net sales increased 38% on an as-reported basis and 24% on a core basis as compared to the prior year. Strong growth in net sales for domestic C&I products in the first quarter was led by national telecom and rental equipment customers as well as growing demand for our natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects. We also have a substantial backlog for C&I products, which increased further during the first quarter, supporting our expectations for solid growth to continue in the category. Shipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel grew again in the first quarter, and improving close rates helped drive growth in orders and backlog in this channel. Shipments to national telecom customers increased significantly during the first quarter as compared to the prior year, benefiting from elevated levels of capital spending by several of our larger telecom customers. The catalyst for the investment in backup power in this important vertical continues to be driven by the elevated power outage environment over the last several years, the power security mandate in California and the growing number of connected wireless devices alongside the build-out of high-powered and increasingly critical 5G communications infrastructure. We also experienced very strong growth with our national and independent rental customers this quarter. These customers are investing heavily in fleet equipment. And we remain optimistic about the long-term demand outlook for mobile products given the megatrend of the critical need for infrastructure improvements and recently passed legislation supporting infrastructure spending. We're also very excited about the opportunity to bring our mobile energy storage solutions, which we recently added through the Off Grid Energy acquisition in the U.K. to the North American market in 2022. And we have already seen meaningful order activity from key domestic channel partners for these products. Additionally, we're experiencing significant momentum in project wins for our natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional standby power generation such as their use in Energy as a Service, microgrid solutions and other distributed generation projects. A diverse range of customers from national and regional commercial accounts to municipalities and beyond are showing substantial interest in these solutions. We believe this demand is being driven by the need for enhanced resiliency and grid stability that these larger blocks of power offer for grid operators while simultaneously providing a tangible and meaningfully improved return on investment for the asset owners. Strong momentum also continued in our International segment as well with shipments increasing 49% year-over-year on an as-reported basis during the first quarter, with 27% core net sales growth when excluding the benefit of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. The core sales growth was driven by strength across all regions, most notably in Europe and Latin America. Overall demand remains very strong across our International segment with backlog further increasing since our fourth quarter earnings call. The European region is seeing particularly strong demand for portable generators, mobile products and C&I generators due in part to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the near term, a heightened focus on energy independence and security has emerged in the region. But longer-term implications of the conflict remain uncertain given the troubling and very fluid nature of the situation. In addition to strong core growth, our recent international energy technology acquisitions, Deep Sea Electronics and Off Grid Energy, reported impressive results in the first quarter. Numerous sales synergies are developing for Off Grid Energy's mobile storage systems through Generac's global distribution footprint, resulting in incremental demand in new geographies and driving significant backlog for these products. We have also begun additional product development projects within the mobile storage category to significantly expand the power capacity range of the product lineup. Global demand for Deep Sea's controls and automation products at are at all-time highs. And order intake has surpassed our previous expectations. With respect to synergies, we are further embedding Deep Sea controls and technology into our legacy C&I products globally. Additionally, Deep Sea provides important capabilities that are core to the growth of our portfolio of grid-connected Energy as a Service and microgrid solutions. Our International segment has also experienced much stronger profitability despite inflationary headwinds and supply chain challenges. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margins expanded to 15.2% from 6.2% in the prior year period due to the accretive margin profiles of the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions, improved overhead absorption and better operating leverage on significantly higher volumes. In closing today, I'm extremely proud of Generac team's efforts in delivering record sales -- record net sales results and navigating the difficult operating environment to deliver overall results that exceeded our previous expectations. We'll be discussing in detail our 2022 forecast update during the outlook portion of our prepared comments this morning. But in short, we're raising our net sales guidance for full-year 2022 and maintaining our overall guidance for adjusted EBITDA dollars, which reflects the visibility provided from our increased backlog and confidence in our ability to execute. Supply chain challenges in the overall inflationary environment have persisted, but we believe we've also taken appropriate measures to offset these ongoing headwinds. While we are tactically executing on our near-term initiatives, we remain focused on the longer-term megatrends for our business and their alignment with the strategic pillars of our Powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy. As we execute on our strategic plan, we're building out an ecosystem of connected energy technology solutions for both the residential and C&I markets to address the challenges faced by the aging electrical grid and the serious supply and demand imbalances that are developing. We remain confident and squarely focused on building out the solutions portfolio as the modernization of the power grid is expected to significantly expand our addressable markets and ultimately lead to further growth opportunities for our business in the years ahead. I now want to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our first quarter 2022 results and our updated outlook for 2022. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at first quarter 2022 results in more detail. Net sales increased 41% to $1.14 billion during the first quarter of 2022, another all-time record as compared to $807 million in the prior year first quarter. The combination of contributions from acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate plus 7% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the first quarter by product class. Residential product sales grew to $777 million as compared to $542 million in the prior year, representing a 43% increase despite a strong prior year comparable. Contributions from the ecobee and Chilicon acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 5% of revenue growth for the quarter. Home standby generator sales made up the majority of the residential product core sales growth, increasing by approximately 50% over the prior year as we continue to expand production capacity for these products. Shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems also grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year as the U.S. residential solar plus storage market continues to grow and as we expand our distribution network for our clean energy solutions. Partially offsetting this strength, portable generators faced a tough prior year comparison due to the significant outages caused from the severe winter storm impacting several states in the first quarter of 2021, including the high-profile Texas winter storm event. Commercial and industrial product net sales for the first quarter of 2022 increased 38% to $279 million as compared to $202 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency had a net positive impact of approximately 13% on net sales growth during the quarter. The very strong core revenue growth was broad-based, driven by growth across all regions, highlighted by robust telecom and rental volumes. Net sales for the other products and services category increased 28% to $80 million as compared to $63 million in the first quarter of 2021. Contributions from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 8% of revenue growth during the quarter. Strength in aftermarket service parts continues to be a key driver of the core sales growth in this category due to the heightened power outage activity in recent years and a larger and growing install base of our products in the field, which is also leading to higher levels of extended warranty revenue. Also contributing to the increase were continued growth in our services offering in certain parts of our business and higher Grid Services subscription revenue. Gross profit margin was 31.8% compared to 39.9% in the prior year first quarter as the challenging supply chain and overall inflationary environment drove higher input costs during the quarter. Specifically, the lagging impact of elevated commodity prices and other component surcharges, higher inbound logistics and expediting costs, increased labor rates and continued plant ramp-up costs all pressured margins in the current year quarter. The increasing realization of multiple price actions previously implemented and favorable sales mix partially offset these margin headwinds. Operating expenses increased $73 million or 55% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily driven by the impact of recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions together with the increase in intangible amortization expense. In addition, higher employee costs and additional variable expenses from the significant increase in sales volumes also contributed to the increase. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization, increased approximately 50 basis points as compared to the prior year period due to the impact of recent acquisitions that have a higher operating expense load relative to sales given their start-up nature. Adjusted EBITDA, before deducting for noncontrolling interest as defined in our earnings release was $196 million or 17.3% of net sales in the first quarter as compared to $214 million or 26.5% of net sales in the prior year. The decline in EBITDA margin was driven by the previously discussed decline in gross margins. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 39% to $965 million in the quarter as compared to $693 million in the prior year, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 5% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $170 million, representing a 17.7% margin as compared to $207 million in the prior year or 29.9% of net sales. The lower Domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to significantly higher input costs and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the increasing realization of previously implemented pricing actions and favorable sales mix. International segment sales increased 49% to $171 million in the quarter as compared to $115 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 27% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $26 million or 15.2% of net sales as compared to $7.1 million or 6.2% of net sales in the prior year. The significant expansion in International EBITDA margins was primarily due to strong margin contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions, and improved overhead absorption and operating leverage on the significantly higher sales volumes. Now switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2022 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $114 million as compared to $149 million for the first quarter of 2021. GAAP income taxes during the current year first quarter were $28.6 million or an effective tax rate of 19.7% as compared to $35.4 million or an effective tax rate of 19.1% in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a lower discrete benefit from equity compensation in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year. The effective tax rate in the first quarter is seasonally below our full-year 2022 guidance due primarily to the timing of vesting of certain equity awards and the related benefit recognized for tax purposes. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.57 in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $2.33 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release was $135 million in the current year quarter or $2.09 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $153 million in the prior year or $2.38 per share. As disclosed in our reconciliation schedules in our earnings release, our adjusted net income and EPS for the current year no longer adjust for cash taxes due to the expiration of our significant tax shield that originated from our LBO transaction in 2006. Cash flow from operations was negative $10 million as compared to positive $153 million in the prior year first quarter. And free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was negative $37 million as compared to positive $126 million in the same quarter last year. The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a much higher working capital investment in the current year quarter. The higher working capital investment was primarily driven by a seasonal inventory build for certain product categories, increasing production rates and further increases in inventory levels due to the challenging supply chain environment and extended logistics in transit times. As of March 31, 2022, we had approximately $500 million of liquidity, comprised of $206 million of cash on hand and $290 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in May 2026. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.09 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter of only 1.3x on an as-reported basis. In addition, recall our term loan doesn't mature until December 2026. We do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date, and it has a low cost of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We also have interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. With that, I will now provide further comments on our updated outlook for 2022. As Aaron previously discussed, our strong execution and ability to maneuver through this challenging supply chain environment allowed us to exceed shipment expectations during the first quarter of 2022. In addition, the higher-than-expected inflationary environment that has manifested over the last couple of months has required us to implement another round of price increases here in the second quarter of 2022. As a result of these factors, we are raising our top line guidance for full-year 2022 as net sales are now expected to increase between 36% to 40% as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis, which includes an approximate 5% to 7% net impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This is an increase from the previous guidance of net sales growth between 32% to 36%. This revenue outlook now assumes shipments of residential products increased at a mid- to high 40% rate during 2022, up from prior expectation for a low 40% rate. And revenue for C&I products is still expected to grow at a high-teens rate compared to the prior year despite larger-than-expected FX headwinds. Importantly, this guidance still assumes a level of power outage activity during the year in line with the longer-term baseline average. As a result, consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year. Given we are still expect to be producing at full capacity for home standby generators throughout the year, the upside of a major power outage would be more limited to incremental portable generator shipments during 2022, meaning any extra lift for home standby generators from a major power outage would most likely result in incremental revenue in 2023. As we ramp capacity and our supply chain for home standby and clean energy products and as incremental price realization kicks in over the remainder of the year, we're expecting quarterly revenue to increase sequentially over the next couple of quarters, with net sales in the first half approaching 47% weighted as a percent of full-year sales. Looking at our gross margin profile. As we have discussed at length, cost pressures have continued to impact our profitability thus far in 2022. We expect first quarter 2022 to be the peak of this year-over-year price/cost headwind as price realization has a more meaningful positive impact on our gross margins, certain inflationary pressures progressively ease for the remainder of the year and as the benefits of our focused cost-reduction initiatives further materialize. As a result of these factors, we expect quarterly gross margin percent to increase sequentially throughout 2022, with fourth quarter gross margin is expected to recover back to first quarter 2021 levels in the 40% range. This would result in gross margin percent for the full-year 2022 to be approximately in line with 2021 levels. Looking at operating expenses as a percent of sales. Excluding amortization expense, we expect full-year 2022 OpEx percent to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to full-year 2021, primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions that have a higher operating expense load relative to sales given their start-up nature. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full-year 2022 before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 21.5% to 2020 -- to 22.5% compared to the previously expected range of approximately 22% to 23%. The additional price increases required to offset the higher-than-expected inflationary pressures are resulting in this modest EBITDA percent dilution from previous expectation. Importantly, the midpoint of this guidance range would result in adjusted EBITDA dollars in line with our previous guidance. From a seasonality perspective, adjusted EBITDA margins are projected to improve significantly as we move through the year, primarily driven by improving gross margins as previously discussed. We expect that the first quarter marked the low point for adjusted EBITDA margins for the year with the progression of sequential improvement approximately level loaded by a quarter, resulting in fourth quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA margins returning to the 26% range, similar to Q1 2021 levels. Several additional guidance items that we provide to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow also require updating for the full-year 2022. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 23% to 24% for the remaining quarters of the year, resulting in a full-year 2022 GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 23%. This compares to our previous full-year 2022 guidance of 24% to 25%. This decrease is driven primarily by the higher-than-expected equity compensation deduction in the first quarter as well as lower state income taxes expected during the full-year 2022. For full-year 2022, we now expect interest expense to be approximately $42 million to $44 million, an increase from the previous guidance of $41 million to $43 million, reflecting higher than previously expected levels of LIBOR rates throughout 2022, while still assuming no additional term loan principal payments during the year. Depreciation expense is now forecast to be approximately $54 million to $56 million in 2022 given our assumed CapEx guidance as compared to $56 million to $58 million previously expected. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2022 is now expected to be at the high end of the previously expected range of $95 million to $100 million. Stock compensation expense is expected to be between $32 million to $34 million for the year. As a result of these updated guidance items in our first quarter performance, net income as a percent of sales is expected to be similar to our prior guidance. Our full-year weighted average diluted share count is expected to be approximately 65.0 million to 65.5 million shares. Our capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately 2.5% to 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. For full-year 2022, operating and free cash flow generation is still expected to follow historical seasonality and be disproportionately weighted toward the second half of the year. Given the very strong organic sales growth expected during 2022, we still expect the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow to be approximately 70% to 80% for the full-year as a portion of cash flows will be invested in working capital to support this growth. Finally, this updated 2022 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Halloran: Hey, good morning everyone.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Mike.
York Ragen: Good morning.
Michael Halloran: So can we just dig into the home standby side a little bit? Obviously, you seem pretty comfortable with the in-home consultation to the consultations in general being in line with your expectations. But backlog came down. How much of that is a comment on demand coming in a little bit versus your capacity ramping to cover some of that incremental backlog? And maybe just what you're seeing in the channel in general from a customer demand perspective at this point, book-to-bill or anything like that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Mike, I think I'd point to a couple of things that we talked about on the prepared remarks, and I'll give you a little bit more color around it beyond that. So the HSB backlog did come down as projected. Our demand was in line with our expectations. So IHCs, I think in our prepared remarks, we said they were 3x the 2020 Q1 levels. So they're significantly elevated when you look past the Texas event last year, which is just -- was a very unique set of circumstances. And none of our guidance contemplated that reoccurring nor does any of our guidance contemplate any major events happening this year. So if something does happen, we're going to obviously end the year with even greater demand than we project at this point. On the execution side of things, we did execute better than we thought we would in Q1. So our output levels for home standby were better. We were able to navigate a couple of supply chain challenges that we're facing and continue to face. Our Wisconsin factories as a matter of fact just continue to outpace our projections here. We're getting a lot of output out of the factories here. And then obviously, in Trenton, South Carolina, we've been aggressively ramping that factory. And that output grows every week that goes by, so continue to lift that up. So the combination of increased output and then the demand being in line still puts us with an incredible backlog for HSB well above kind of where we would have thought we would be at this point. Especially if you go back to our Investor Day remarks in September, we really weren't planning on kind of being where we're at today. So pretty exciting times for the HSB category.
Michael Halloran: So a question on pricing then as a follow-up. Maybe a sense for the cumulative amount of pricing you guys have put in over the last arbitrarily 12 months or so. But did I hear you right, Aaron, in the prepared remarks that you suggested that the backlog was repriced for the current marketplace?
Aaron Jagdfeld: It will be on June 1st. Correct.
Michael Halloran: Okay. And cumulative pricing?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Cumulative pricing, I think high teens is kind of what we would call over the last close now to like 15 months, 18 months maybe even.
York Ragen: Including this latest round that we monitor here in April.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Including this latest round here in April, which is the repricing of the backlog on June 1 effective date.
Michael Halloran: Got it. Thanks guys. Appreciate your time.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Thomas Moll: Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey Tommy.
Thomas Moll: Aaron, I wanted to stick with the theme of pricing here. What insight do you have on how elastic demand is for home standby? And any insight into what portion of the underlying unit volumes are financed versus purchased outright by the homeowner?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. No, those are great questions, Tommy. I'll probably let York maybe tackle the finance piece. I don't know if we've given that.
York Ragen: I mean it's still a relatively small piece.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. But it's growing. I mean it's been growing pretty rapidly, the finance piece.
York Ragen: Historically, it wasn't a financed purchase. But it's growing dramatically.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Well, I think as the category expands...
York Ragen: Yes. Maybe if it's 10% of the volume, but it's growing.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's been growing quite a bit. In terms of elasticity around pricing, Tommy, I think what we would tell you is we have a ton of data and metrics that we watch very closely. So everything from inbound consultation request to, obviously, the proposal costs that go out on average. Recall that the high-teens number that I just quoted for pricing impact on the HSB is just the product itself. And the product itself is maybe half of the total cost of the project. So you have other inputs there around labor and other materials that have also increased, of course. But when we look at those project costs, we're able to then look at the close rates that we're seeing, and that helps us kind of gauge the impact of each round of pricing. To-date, we're not seeing any significant impact on pricing. It's an expensive product to begin with, right? So we used to say it was all in kind of a $9,000, $10,000 project for a home standby generator. Today, it's maybe an $11,000 project to $11,500 when you look at the average proposal costs. That extra $1,500, $1,000 to $1,500 doesn't seem to be dampening the enthusiasm for demand for the category. And I think that really speaks to the underlying megatrends that are driving the need for resiliency and backlog. And I would point to, again, in our prepared remarks, we talked about IHCs being up 3x over this point last -- in 2020. So just up dramatically over that environment. And the pricing would be that kind of mid-teens, and maybe 20% overall increase in product category price. So we feel pretty good that -- and I would say this, just my last comment on this. Having been around this business as long as I've been around it. We've had to do pricing over the years, in the past. And the category is incredibly durable with respect to the demand and with respect to the impact from pricing. That durability, I'd point you back to the 2008, 2009 recession. Our overall consumer or residential business was up even in the depths of that. And I think if anybody would have said that, that category would be up, kind of a large ticket kind of arguably discretionary product tied to residential investment, I think most people would have said, you're kind of nuts. But we actually did outperform. And I think it speaks to the potential durability of the category. And just one last comment. I know I said that was my last comment. One last comment. You also have to think of the category because really it's a home improvement project. Yes, think of it as the impact of the price of that product in relation to the home's value. A lot of home values are way up. So when you think about it in the context of as a percentage of the home's value, it's not up significantly at all. In fact, I might argue that home values have risen faster than the price of the project itself. So anyway, I'll leave it at that. But thanks for the question, Tommy.
Thomas Moll: Yes. And I appreciate the context. Aaron, sticking on the home standby theme. As we think about some of the factors into next year, you mentioned that you've achieved and held a higher level of underlying demand versus the pre-pandemic baseline. And so once we get through most or all of your backlog and assuming away any kind of major outage event next year, what are some of the things that you can do to drive that awareness higher or to drive that underlying demand higher? I mean I'm thinking largely around customer acquisition spend. But there's a lot of focus on units next year once it's a "normal environment." We'll see if we ever get there. What is within your control to drive that demand?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. No, it's a great question and something that we're constantly focused on. I would tell you, we test a lot of things. We have hesitated to kind of roll out bigger things right now, because obviously, demand has been strong. The backlog is as big as it is. So adding to that, we're kind of up against do we frustrate customers with the lead times versus adding incremental demand. So I would tell you this, what we've been -- here's an example of a program we're testing. We have accumulated hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of unclosed leads over the last several years. Just as the category awareness has grown, all of those leads came in based on prior spend. We know that when we reengage unclosed leads, in particular after maybe a localized outage or maybe on the back of a promotion regionally or nationally, or just the phone call just to reengage them and maybe discuss ahead of the hurricane season, the upcoming hurricane season if they're located in those regions or ahead of the upcoming winter season if they're in those regions, we found that we can move the needle on close rate. So we've stood up internally a group, a team that is outbound calling to those unclosed leads. That is something that as we watch the return on that, and we're very pleased so far with the early returns on that pilot program, that's one area that could be scaled, could be scaled quickly. It could be scaled with outsourced resources or we could internalize it. We have a lot of capability when it comes to call centers and the ability to do those types of outbound campaigns. So that's one area. Another area is pulling on promotional levers, which we, again, largely not done over the last several years. I think there's a tremendous opportunity there just because we've been lying low. And you do have consumers who want to wait on those promotions. They find whether they're extended warranty promotions or if we're talking about free first year of monitoring type promotions or whatever the promotion may be. We've done those promotions in the past to great effect. We have done a lot less of them over the last two years. So that would be another lever to pull. So there's -- I think we have a lot of things at our disposal. Look, a lot of people, I think, are wondering if you listen to this call or you're watching the company, what's going to happen to demand for home standby in 2023. I mean if you've learned nothing about following this company over the last decade, it's that -- we're not sitting around waiting for some exogenous event to happen. We're very active, very proactive and we're constantly pushing the category forward. We always have been. We always will be. That's one of the reasons we have such a massive share of the category. We are the category. And when you got the leader like that we are, it's incumbent on us to continue to move the needle. And we have definitely moved the needle to a new place. You mentioned it a new hire -- new baseline level. We've seen this happen time and time and time again with this category. It's expanding. It continues to expand. And I'm confident that in the future, it will continue to expand. And that's just -- I think being around it as long as we have and understanding the drivers, the purchasing drivers and seeing what we're seeing in terms of the demand markers out there, we're really encouraged that the category is going to continue to grow.
Operator: Your next question is from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ross Gilardi: Good morning, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Ross.
York Ragen: Hey, Ross.
Ross Gilardi: Maybe we could just expand on your last comment there, Aaron. So if you take your new guide, you're at $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion in revenue in 2022. And your three year target from your Investor Day, I think, it's $5.5 billion or $5.6 billion. So how are you thinking about that now? I mean is it realistic to think you'll raise the $5.5 billion sometime soon. And within the $5.5 billion, is the home standby business the larger or smaller business, larger or smaller business than where it will finish in '22? And if we see the HSB come off, it's high in the next one to three years, you have enough other growth levers to comfortably get to the $5.5 billion.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I think when we laid out the guidance in the Investor Day, Ross, we never said we were going to grow in a straight line. The company continues to -- we grow. We're a grower and a dynamic grower at that. But we know that there are things that happen in the category sometimes that are outside of our control, things like what happened in Texas. And you don't know if you're going to get a strong hurricane season. Recall that none of our -- I think in our Investor Day, we really only had one major event assumed in the three year period. So to that effect, we've got a number of things that weren't in the guidance back in the Investor Day, things like ecobee. We don't have additional M&A in the guide. We're seeing some tremendous potential out of our Grid Services teams. We've got the entire clean energy story that is -- we're just tapping into a whole new market opportunity. It's pretty interesting. I mean we go through -- so we do strategic planning like every company, I'm sure. And we go through a pretty rigorous exercise around kind of our kind of TAM and SAM evaluations in each of the categories and channels that we participate in. The total addressable market that we have available to us today is so much greater than what it was even a couple of years ago. That based on not only where we've acquired companies and gotten into new spaces, but where we've continued to grow organically, where some of the spaces we were in before are growing organically. It's just -- it's actually pretty stunning. Yes, and think I it's -- to me, when I think about why is the company growing the way it's growing. It grew 50% last year. Our guide here this morning is to grow between 36% and 40% again this year. There aren't a lot of companies doing that. So why is that? I would tell you, I think it's just we are taking advantage of the opportunities in front of us. We're taking advantage of what we've built and we're leveraging it. We're leveraging it for better effects. We're leveraging it into these bigger addressable markets. And I think that, that is a big reason why we're experiencing the growth we're experiencing. Will that continue in the future at these rates? I mean I don't know. We're not here to update guidance this morning from a long-term basis. But I do know that all the signs that we have and all the success that we've experienced point to much bigger market opportunities based, in particular, on the megatrends that were tapped into strategically here. I think we're just in the right place at the right time with the right products. And I think we're going to continue to build on that not only the remainder of this year, but in the years going forward.
Ross Gilardi: And just HSB dealer inventories, are they normalized yet? And then just when you talk about production, you seem to be saying more so that you're getting -- you're squeezing more out of Wisconsin. Is trend actually hitting the production targets that you had laid out at the Investor Day? Or is Wisconsin having to overcompensate for that, maybe ramping slower than you thought?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's a great question. Trenton is actually on pace with where we thought they would be. Really, the outperformance in Q1 came out of the additional output out of the Wisconsin facilities. We continue to dial in. We've added a lot of automation to all of those facilities with the kinds of production rates we're talking about here with HSB. To be honest, I mean, being around the category as long as they've been around, they're mind-blowing in terms of the daily rates that we're producing. It's -- but to see our Wisconsin facility continuing...
York Ragen: [Indiscernible] through supply.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And the supply chain challenges getting around some of that stuff.
York Ragen: We baked some of that in.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We had. We had maybe hedged a little bit in Q1 for that. So that's the answer to that question. On the dealer inventories, we're seeing days of inventory be a little at the high end of where they've been historically. That happens kind of seasonally about now. It's coming out of the winter season. It's been -- and the spring weather has been, I don't know about many of the people on the call here, but if you live anywhere in the upper Midwest, it's a wonderful winter we're having this spring. I think I actually saw snowflakes again yesterday, so May 3. So it's been difficult to get out and install product at the kind of pacing we want to see. And we're also starting to see some of the limitations of the expansion of the category in terms of permitting in some areas, especially some newer areas like California, just really struggling with getting permits issued there. So that's been a hurdle. We called it out a couple of times. It just continues to befuddle me how difficult that is permitting in that particular region. But we need to increase the install pace because output is increasing. So that is a massive area of focus for us. And we're working hard with our existing dealers, but also with new dealers in terms of increasing their ability to install products more quickly. And they're struggling also, by the way, with labor. That's another struggle point for the channel out there. So it is something we're watching closely. But we are seeing install rates move up. We just need to see it move up even faster.
York Ragen: And we believe there's buyers for those units that are in the field. So I think that...
Aaron Jagdfeld: Well, absolutely. Yes. The IHC.
York Ragen: Based on the IHC volume.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Based on the IHC volume, we think the demand is there to support what we're seeing in the field in terms of inventory.
York Ragen: Going to increase the install bandwidth.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Right.
Operator: Your next question is from Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners. Please go ahead.
Philip Shen: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. First one is on a follow-up on the price increase. My sense is it was around 6% that's effective June 1. Can you talk through if that's right? And then also, what is the chance that we could see more price increases in Q3 and Q4? Is that a much -- is that a meaningfully low probability? Or is that actually on the radar because of the inflation you see ahead?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's a great question, Phil. I would tell you that you're pretty close on the price increase. It depends on which SKU and which model, but kind of mid-single digits, 5%, 6%, somewhere in that range with the last round of pricing. And that was across a number of products in the home standby category for sure. And then even a little more aggressive in some of the clean energy products. You may have your channel checks. In terms of where we'll go with pricing, Q3, Q4, I mean, I would tell you right now the guidance contemplates that additional pricing because we're taking the somewhat extraordinary step of repricing the backlog as of June 1, that's going to read through a lot quicker than previous price increases. So today, we feel like our guidance -- if you just look at kind of the margin progression here, Q1 is going to be the bottom. Q4, we're going to return kind of somewhere like back to where we were kind of in the beginning of 2021. And so that's a pretty big step, right, to get from today to there. And a lot of that, because of that 5% to 6% kind of reading through the back -- through the balance of the year here, alongside some additional cost reductions, plus previous pricing actions that we've done also reading through to get the full impact of all the pricing. So we feel pretty good. That said, obviously, sitting here like on the last call, it was prior to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. We were actually starting to see some pullback in some of the basic commodities. We're big users of steel, copper and aluminum. We're actually seeing some moderation in those commodity costs. And then that conflict happened. And we saw kind of a reengagement of those inflationary trends on those basic commodities as well as just continued and persisting high logistics costs, which have been really somewhat amazing to watch. We were very optimistic around the last call that those costs, commodities and logistics would start to moderate through the balance of the year. I'm not as optimistic as I sit here today that they will. And that's reflective of this kind of most recent round of pricing and why we did that.
York Ragen: We're -- in our latest guide, we've got steel prices at their higher levels here. And copper, now copper has actually moderated since then, but...
Aaron Jagdfeld: It has actually pulled back.
York Ragen: Yes. And we are starting to see the beginnings of some of the logistics costs moderate, so that will be helpful. But yes, if costs continue to rise from like, let's say, today's levels, then it's something we would have to evaluate. But I think the team was able to react very quickly to these higher inflationary pressures that we're seeing today.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And given the elasticity comments I made prior, it doesn't worry us if we have to do that. the thing that we probably could have done to help ourselves earlier is to reprice the backlog more fully earlier on. That's an extraordinary step. We try to avoid doing that because we know that our distribution partners, oftentimes, they've already bid out a job. They already have a contracted arrangement with end customers. So repricing the backlog is effectively just reducing their economics on a project or they have to go back to their end customer and also increase price, which different channel partners approach that differently. But that's a pretty painful step. And we understand that. But that's something that we -- it doesn't worry us. If we have to do that, we will do that again.
Philip Shen: Okay. In terms of capacity, Aaron, you just talked through hitting your Q2 '22 double, double. And you talked through the strong demand, the new baseline level. What else do you need to see before you become -- well, what else do you need to see for the next capacity expansion to become official? Like where are you in that process? We've talked through over the past few quarters here. And you've been waiting for something. What is that something? And how close are we? And if we are looking at another leg of expansion, where is it? And to what degree can you sketch it out?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Yes. Thanks, Phil. And we've been in the process for evaluating either an expansion in our existing facility in Trenton or perhaps another facility for home standby production in particular. We haven't announced a location yet or what our plans are there. We did take the extraordinary step of ordering some of the additional tooling we'll need to take another leg up in capacity -- to increase capacity further there because we know the lead times are long. That tooling right now would hit sometime in the first quarter of next year in 2023. Where we deliver that tooling to and where we take that production capacity to is the question. In terms of what do we need to see, I think we've already seen it. We've seen a new and higher baseline for the category. We know that we want to have, for ourselves, we need to build in some upside here in terms of the expansion capacity, if you will. We need some excess capacity there to handle where demand surges happen. We call it surge capacity. Today, we think we have -- we've been in pretty good shape not knowing what's going to happen in the back half of the year for the demand curve. Again, all of our guidance here does not assume, even though contrary to what the latest hurricane forecasts are, does not assume that we get a major event. So if we do see an active hurricane season, obviously, we'll want to move faster not slower on those capacity expansion plans. But in the meantime, we're going to have to figure out where we deliver this tooling. And we're going to have to figure out what that kind of longer-term capacity for HSB looks like. We do have some similar challenges on the C&I side of our business, which has been growing at a very similar clip. We know that we need to add capacity there and are also in the current evaluation phase of do we add another facility? Do we expand existing facilities? What do we do to address that as that category builds out? We've been, in the meantime, filling up our facility south of the border outside of Mexico City. We have a brand-new beautiful facility down there that we built a couple of years ago, mainly for the Latin American markets. And it was going to give us really nice long-term growth capacity down there. We've just filled it up very quickly with our capacity each year in the U.S. and Canada. So we're starting to get really tight on capacity in C&I. So that's another area. And then clean energy is another area where we have to evaluate capacity needs for the longer-term. So that is a very active process across the entire business. When you grow 50% one year and 36% to 40% the next year, figuring out what that footprint is going to be to accommodate that growth and growth in the future, it's almost an everyday discussion.
Operator: Your next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Hammond: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond: So I know you covered some on kind of price cost. But I just want to kind of level set on your confidence in the second half kind of margin ramp. And just as it relates to kind of the start-up freight and component surcharges, if you need some reprieve there to kind of hit that margin ramp. Thanks.
York Ragen: Yes, Jeff, this is York. I mean looking at our commentary, gross margins are expected to go up, let's say, roughly 8% from Q1 to Q4. I would say about half of that will just be the realization of the pricing that we've just been talking about at length here over the call. The other half is the cost inputs that you just mentioned. If you think about like where steel was at its peak, it is actually off from its peak. So relative to what we're experiencing in Q1, which was the peak, and as that progresses through the year, steel should come off a bit. We are starting to the beginnings of lower inbound freight costs. We don't believe we'll need to expedite as much as we do feel like we brought in a good amount of safety stock here over the last couple of quarters. So we just believe that inbound logistics cost should moderate a bit. As we ramp, we'll start absorbing in particularly our Trenton plant better. And then we do have line of sight on focused bill of material cost reductions on home standby telecom product, et cetera. So we feel like we have got good line of sight on some of the easing input cost to execute on that gross margin improvement. As I mentioned before, the guidance does assume steel costs at these higher levels that ramped up after the Russian-Ukraine invasion there. And so we feel like from a future commodity standpoint, we think we've embedded the current environment into the guide. So good line of sight to all the pieces to give that 8% increase in gross margin.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. Great. And then I don't know if I missed it, can you give us the updated lead time on home standby? And then just any updates on kind of just the net metering noise and kind of this trade circumvention kind of having any impact on your clean energy businesses?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. No, it's a great question there, Jeff. About 20 weeks on HSB today on inbound orders, so still pretty extended, pretty long. Backlog is still well north of $1 billion on HSB. But it's -- we're continuing to make progress there as we ramp production. In terms of -- on the clean energy business, the impacts to the net metering discussions that have been going on kind of coast to coast, right, from California to Florida, we've seen the Florida thing play out. The governor there vetoed, vetoed the potential rule changes around net metering, the curtailment of net metering. California is reevaluating the proposed draft rule making there by the PUC. We don't see -- actually, when you think about it, let's just take California as an example. We don't have a dramatic penetration in the State of California. So really probably kind of a nonevent for us. In fact, I would say probably that kind of a situation, net metering kind of being curtailed, and by the way, that's kind of the inevitable situation around net metering. As you get more homes that have solar and are producing their own power on-site, selling that back to utilities at retail rates is untenable economically. I mean it doesn't work longer-term. So -- but there needs to be a gradual kind of glide path. We've talked about this. We've engaged regulators on this. You can't have this abrupt kind of pulling the punch bowl away kind of situation. I think that's detrimental to the industry. But in what's being proposed in California, that would -- if they did pull the punch bowl away and net metering was curtailed dramatically there as being as proposed, storage is the answer. So we've actually seen marked increase in interest in storage systems as a result. And I think inevitably, that is what is going to drive storage attachment rates even higher. We're kind of in that 20% to 25% range right now on storage attachment rates. And then the trade circumvention discussion, really that -- we're talking to our channel partners. They're not concerned about it in terms of impacting resi solar, maybe more on the utility scale solar projects, those bigger projects. Some of the suppliers of panels to those types of projects are maybe going to be the ones that are caught up first in this evaluation or this investigation. On the residential side, frankly, there are other panel providers that might push panel prices up a bit. But again, looking at the total cost of these projects, not dramatically so in terms of the impact to the projects. They just don't think there'll be any real demand disruption on the back of that at the residential level. So no major concerns there, at least today, based on our discussions with channel partners.
Operator: Your next question is from Brian Drab with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Blake Keating: All right, good morning. This is Blake Keating on for Brian.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Blake.
Blake Keating: You have taken my question, I'll just ask a quick one here since it's after the hour. Have the two lockdowns in China affected any of your suppliers there or your supply chain network overall? And do you see that as a potential risk moving forward that they continue to be under lockdown?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, it's a great question, Blake. It's not helpful. Just broadly, we have supply chain there in that part of the world. And the lockdowns have created just another, yet another kind of struggle or challenge for our operational teams. So we're working around it. I do think that York may have made this comment before relative to our current working capital situation. We're feeling like -- we've got a lot of inventory sitting here that we're preparing for season. So you can kind of think of it as like a little extra safety stock right now, which is helping us buffer the impact of that. But we do have some instances where we're having to expedite logistics. Again we're having to fly some products over-the-top of things to get here faster because of the lockdowns where we can't load a ship or we can't get something here on a timely basis. So if those lockdowns extend, could that impact us? I think, like anything, probably would have some kind of an impact. I do think that we've done a really nice job over the last couple of years broadening our supply chain, meaning we have fewer single sources of supply now than we've ever had for some of our critical categories like home standby. So we do have other options. We're not as concentrated on supply. So that I think just derisks the category a bit and makes any one disruption that much less impactful. So I feel like we're in a better shape to weather that.
Blake Keating: Got it, thank you. I will pass along.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Blake.
Operator: Your next question is from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark, your line open.
Mark Strouse: Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, now we can hear you.
Mark Strouse: Sorry, guys. I was on mute. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning. Most of them have been answered. I did want to talk about the new Chilicon product, though. I'm sorry if I missed that. But are the new micros, are they still on track for introduction later this quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: They are. Yes, we're going to be shipping our first beta sites here late in Q2. And we expect to ramp full production and full shipment volumes here in the second half. I mean we still had a pretty modest part of our clean energy guide for the year that was associated with PWRmicro, that hasn't changed at all. We know that, that's going to be a slower ramp than probably what our storage ramp was originally. But I'll say this, every time we engage with a channel partner in the kind of the renewable space, the solar space, they're very excited to have us there as a potential supplier. We know that we've got -- we got to prove ourselves there. But we like where the opportunities could take us. That could be one of the more meaningful things, one of the more meaningful product launches here not only for clean energy, but maybe for this company in the years ahead. If we look forward, we feel really bullish about where that category is going.
Mark Strouse: Great, okay. That's it from me. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Your next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning everyone.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Aaron, I'm wondering if you can just talk about, given the initiatives that you spoke about earlier on the call in terms of growing database and just improvement in conversion rates today versus five years ago, 10 years ago, how do you feel about the peak-to-trough move in residential standby demand in this cycle compared to what feels like a 30% magic number we've seen post Katrina and Rita and Sandy, et cetera? How are you thinking about that within the context of the way you're positioned today? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Jerry, that's a really interesting question and one that we continue to ponder here as well. I would tell you that when you think about Sandy and even Rita and some of the back -- kind of go back, it's more than a decade ago, right? I mean that's the category was in a very different place in terms of awareness, in terms of distribution, in terms of our brand recognition, maybe even in terms of kind of consumers' view on the need for backup power, right? Just given everything that's transpired in the last decade, outages are more frequent. Outages are lasting longer. People are spending more time in their homes. The grid is in a different spot. I think we're that much more dependent on a continuous source of power in our homes and everything that we do. So I don't know if I'm ready to make a comment that it'll be in terms of, numerically, how it will differ. But I think the category, there's no question, that a category is in a completely different place. Awareness levels around the products are much, much higher today than they've ever been. So I feel like that it's not -- back 10 years ago, this was a category that was dependent on the episodic nature of things outside of our control. I do not feel that, that's the case today. I feel like we have a lot more -- we have a lot more levers to pull. We have a lot more buttons to push. And we have a lot more ways to stimulate demand. And there's a lot more need in the marketplace for that.
York Ragen: Well, just think about Grid Services and just having an ROI to the generator where in the past it didn't.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's a whole another angle to -- we're starting to see interest in home standby generators as part of these Grid Services bids. And that would be something we wouldn't have had back then, for sure. I mean it's a great example, York.
Jerry Revich: And I'm wondering, can you just expand on that last point? How close are we to seeing these contracts moving forward as part of Grid Services you had in California in alignment with PWRcell and utilities? I'm wondering if we're close to anything similar for the home standby category and utilities. Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, that's an area we're watching very closely as well. Grid Services, in our prepared remarks, we said we've gotten -- we've won a number of deals. I mean in Q1, our Grid Services team, I think it was eight or nine really kind of important deals for us that some small, some large. But we don't press release every one of them. I know others in our market do because I think they have nothing else to talk about. So you talk about that which is the only thing you can talk about. But for us, it's just one more thing. We're marching forward here, building that out. It's given us a lot of confidence about the future opportunities there, not only just kind of how we think about the balance of this year, but how we exit this year, and going forward with Grid Services. And it's a mix of products. It's not just home standby. It's everything from PWRcells to thermostats. We talked about ecobee in some of the prepared remarks, but lot of interest in thermostats. And there's a reason for that because utilities understand that the cost of a home standby, the cost of a PWRcell, those are pretty expensive products. They're impactful, of course, on the grid. But thermostats are more affordable. And when you talk about low and moderate-income households in particular, utilities have to solve for all of their rate payers. They have to solve this problem across their entire rate paying base. And so not every one of those rate payers is going to be able to put in a battery, a storage system or a home standby generator. So in order to really address all of the ratepayers, thermostats are a great way to do that. And so I've been actually pleasantly surprised by the number of high-quality conversations. I was down in Houston last week talking to a couple of larger utility partners down there. And just the enthusiasm they have for the full suite of products that we offer, but also around thermostats in particular, I think it's just been -- I think it's one of the many areas of traction that we're seeing. But one that I think longer term, this makes a lot of sense because you can deliver a lot of value across the entire rate paying base for not a lot of investment. And I think that really is exciting for many of those grid operators and utility companies.
Operator: Your next question is from Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Maheep Mandloi: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the questions as well. Most of my questions have been answered. Maybe just like on the HSB backlog, if you could help us understand, how much is coming from California and Texas. And just maybe thinking about the growth in those markets beyond 2022, should we expect like a similar run rate you see in your core backup generator markets? Or how -- what are you seeing in the last year in that market? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. No, great questions, Maheep. Thanks. Yes, we don't break out backlog traditionally by region or by state. But obviously, demand curve, we did call out last year and the last quarters last year that we were seeing obviously tremendous interest from those two markets, specifically that you mentioned California and Texas. We have seen a lot of distribution growth in those markets, which would lead to additional growth opportunities in the future. I would just point to one thing that I did mention, I think I answered it kind of indirectly in another question about kind of the field inventories. But California, in particular, the permitting process there has continued to kind of be challenging. It slowed the growth of that market, in my opinion, in terms of what we can install, the rate at which we can install. Interest level in the category remains very high, though. When we look at IHCs, our in-home consultations kind of -- and we look at them historically vis-a-vis kind of the 2020 level, that's something that we still see elevated levels in Texas and California, for sure, in terms of interest in the category. And again, I just mentioned on the last question, Q&A question, I took that we were down in Houston last week. We talked to a number of the participants down there in the market, and they continue to see very strong demand around the product. I think there are a lot of homeowners who maybe were disenfranchised when they tried to get a quote a year ago in the height of the demand surge coming off of the Texas winter event. They were a little bit disenfranchised by either the lead times or just even the time to get an in-home consultation done. And so they're coming back around this year, and they're starting to think about, okay, I want to be ready for next winter, meaning the winter of 2022. And so they're actually starting to see and talk to customers who were not in the funnel. They just kind of self-selected out because it was just too long to wait. And so they're coming back in and revisiting it. So I feel like those markets are going to be -- continue to be growth markets in the future and an important part of the overall story for home standby growth as we see the penetration rate deepen.
Maheep Mandloi: Thanks.
Operator: Your final question is from Kash Harrison with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Kashy Harrison: Good morning everybody. Thank you for taking my questions and all the details. So circling back to the commentary around home consultations being 3x above 2020 levels. This might be perhaps a simplistic way to think about things, but I mean, should we effectively just think about the "normalized" baseline level excess backlog is more or less being 3x your U.S. residential revenues from back in Q1 2020 since presumably PWRcell and ecobee weren't really contributing that much to revenues back then?
Aaron Jagdfeld: That's an interesting thought. I mean it's an interesting question. I would tell you that you'd have to take into consideration where our close rate is at. That's a part of that equation. And recall that IHCs are not our full, that's not everything we do, right? So it's -- we think it's representative or proxy for the HSB market, but that just is a portion of what we do. So there are other channel partners there. We've also seen growth outside the U.S. markets where we're more established with IHCs. We didn't talk dramatically about that this time. But we continue to see interest in the product category growing outside of North America. But it's a -- I would have to run the numbers. I have to unpack kind of the HSB growth as we've seen it in kind of the backlog there and where we're at if we took that away. I'm not sure that I could say with 100% certainty that the go-forward rate, baseline rate is 3x. I'd have to think more about that. It's an interesting question, though.
York Ragen: You got to forecast future close rates and then what is the storm season this year. And like there's a lot of...
Aaron Jagdfeld: But if you're thinking about baseline, which I think is his question, I think it's an interesting question. But there's a lot that goes into that. But it's certainly going to be higher. That's what we always talk about this new and higher baseline level that gets created after these kinds of events or cycles. And we've seen them historically over the last nearly 30 years. We kind of grow. We infill with new distribution. We infill with new levels of awareness and then the brand recognition and everything that goes into that. And invariably, it holds those higher baseline levels. It's really quite something to see.
York Ragen: And then you've got our clean energy business growing. Then you've got our global C&I business that is doing very well on top of all that.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Right, so those would be accretive to that.
York Ragen: Put all the pieces together, yes.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Accretive, yes.
Kashy Harrison: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just as my follow-up. I'm trying -- I was wondering if you could just maybe circle back to the relationship between the HSB lead times and backlog. You mentioned lead times are now around 20 weeks from 27 to 30 at year-end. But you still have over $1 billion in backlog and you expect to carry some of that into 2023. And so I was wondering if you could just maybe remind us what you consider "normal" lead times to be? And then are there like seasonal market dynamics that would stop the reduction in lead times from being linear, meaning that at the time of the next call, you wouldn't just shave up another seven to 10 weeks and then another seven to 10 weeks after that. I'm just trying to better understand how to think about the relationship of how the lead times might evolve over the next few quarters and then how the backlog might evolve with those lead times? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, that's a great question, Kash, and maybe a good place to end the call today. Obviously, the HSB backlog, I think the thing that, for us, we're going to have a meaningful backlog in HSB when we exit this year. That has become clear to us given the demand has remained robust, in line with our expectations in Q1, but was elevated off from Q4 where we thought it was going to be coming into this year. That pushed kind of the original assumption when we sat at our Investor Day was that we would be back down to our historical lead times, which are zero to two weeks. That was part of your question, what are historical lead times, zero to two weeks. It's almost like, we inventory for the product. We want to have product available so that when there are demand surges, we can handle it. We don't foresee ourselves getting back to that level by the end of this year. In fact, we'll be quite a bit -- lead times will remain fairly elevated. They won't be at 20 weeks, but they won't be back at zero to two weeks. And remember that because we're also we're ramping production here each week of backlog, we're talking about is a bigger number, right, because we're producing a lot more per week. So we're accelerating. And so that week -- each week of backlog is actually a bigger number. So the quantum is growing as we grow our output here. So -- and that's without. By the way, our assumption does not include a major event. So it includes no major events. So a muted hurricane season, that's not what's projected. So we are, I guess, maybe being a bit conservative there. I don't know. We've always guided without storms. Whether that's right or wrong, we could debate that for another hour on this call. But it's -- that's the way we guide. And so there's like a free option embedded in the stock that way. If you want to think of it that way, is that if you do get a storm season that's in line with what experts are saying, we're going to see more demand. I don't know that we'll be able to satisfy much more of that demand this year because it will be a 2023 story more so than anything. We do have portable gens and other things. We're in pretty good shape there. From an inventory standpoint, we'll be able to capitalize on that, if there were outages that were major outages this year. But we're going to have a sizable backlog going in next year. And that's the big -- I think that's where we'd probably leave it at here for this call. So -- but great question.
Operator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session. Now I'll hand the conference back to Mr. Harris for final comments.
Michael Harris: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2022 earnings results with you in early August. Thank you again, and goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-16 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to you host today, Michael Harris, VP Corporate Development and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Michael Harris: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter was a great finish to an outstanding 2021 for Generac, with all-time record performance for both the quarter and the full year for net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS as we achieved record quarterly production levels and continued to experience exceptional demand for our products and our solutions. Additionally, we completed the strategic acquisition of Ecobee during the quarter, which represents a major step forward in our efforts to provide a broader residential energy ecosystem that includes intelligent monitoring and management solutions as well as an increasingly sophisticated user interface platform. Fourth quarter revenue was well ahead of our expectations, driven by higher shipments of home standby generators as build rates for the quarter exceeded our plan due to strong operational execution. Shipments of C&I products also outperformed expectations during the quarter, with broad-based strength continuing across all channels and regions. Despite the substantial increase in production levels, our backlog continued to grow in the fourth quarter across the business, highlighted by home standby generators, providing us with substantial visibility into 2022 being another year of exceptional revenue growth. Year-over-year, overall net sales for the fourth quarter increased 40% to $1.07 billion, an all-time record, and also increased sequentially over the third quarter, which was the previous all-time record. Notably, fourth quarter core sales growth of 35% accelerated relative to the third quarter's core growth rate of 30%, highlighting our strong execution and the progress we continue to make in ramping capacity despite ongoing supply chain challenges. Growth in the quarter was broad-based with both residential and C&I products growing at a low 40% rate compared to the year ago period. Residential sales growth was once again driven by a substantial increase in home standby generator shipments and continued momentum in power cell energy storage shipments as well as the impact from recent acquisitions. The C&I sales increase was led by our telecom and mobile channels domestically, growth across all major regions internationally and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.7% were lower year-over-year as it reflected the impact of higher input costs, driven by ongoing supply chain challenges and the overall inflationary environment as well as the impact of additional operating expense from acquisitions. Partially offsetting these cost headwinds were the initial impact of multiple pricing actions implemented over the past year. And we expect even greater realization of these price increases, along with cost-reduction initiatives and other favorable margin impacts as 2022 progresses. Before discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail, I want to provide some full year 2021 financial highlights as well as share some key accomplishments that we achieved during the year. First and foremost, I want to thank our team of over 9,500 employees globally for their hard work and perseverance throughout an incredibly challenging operating environment in 2021. Our teams have helped us successfully navigate the pandemic while still providing an incredible level of service to our customers and our partners around the world. The hyperscale growth that we are experiencing is a reflection of their commitment to the execution of our strategy and their dedication to our success. As a result of our team's collective efforts, Generac achieved another year of record revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in 2021, far exceeding the previous record levels seen last year. In fact, revenue increased by approximately $1.3 billion, representing 50% growth year-over-year and marking the highest annual growth rate in our history as a public company. This performance came on top of very strong revenue growth over the 3 previous years that averaged in the mid-teens and was highlighted by tremendous growth in home standby generator shipments and approximate doubling of clean energy revenue and strong and broad-based growth in our global C&I products. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $861 million, with a very strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.1% that was similar to the prior year despite a variety of supply chain challenges, considerable inflationary headwinds and significant investments for future growth.  In the third quarter of 2021, we achieved an important milestone by starting production of home standby generators at our newest facility in Trenton, South Carolina. And we continue to make excellent progress in ramping production levels at this new facility as well as at our existing facilities in Wisconsin. Additionally, the further build-out of our clean energy market opportunity was a key highlight during the year as we significantly grew shipments of our power cell energy storage systems through the expansion of our supply chain, increased targeted marketing efforts, growth in our distribution network and the introduction of several exciting new products. We also broadened our Energy Technology Solutions portfolio with several strategic acquisitions, highlighted by Deep Sea Electronics, Chilicon Power, Apricity Code, Off Grid Energy, Tank Utility and ecobee. 2021 was also a heavy year of new products as we introduced our market-leading 26-kilowatt home standby generator, our Generac branded microinverter that we call PWRmicro, the industry's first dedicated engine-driven battery charging system we call PWRgenerator and our innovative PWRmanager load control device. We also introduced a host of new C&I products this year, including a hybrid mobile power solution pairing a mobile energy storage system with a traditional mobile generator, a mobile battery-powered light tower and our first C&I battery storage system for the North American market through the Off Grid acquisition. We also announced smart grid ready capabilities for all our home standby generators, power cell energy storage systems and our natural gas C&I generators. Smart grid ready technology is important to advancing our turnkey approach to grid services and enabling these products to be utilized in programs that provide grid resiliency and an incremental ROI for the asset owner. Finally, during our 2021 Investor Day last September, we debuted our new enterprise strategy we call Powering a Smarter World, which focuses on improving energy resilience and independence, optimizing energy efficiency and consumption, and protecting and building critical infrastructure. We also published our inaugural environmental, social and governance report, highlighting the alignment of our new strategy to key ESG-related external frameworks and standards. These accomplishments provide us considerable momentum as we head into 2022. The guidance we are initiating today is for another year of significant revenue growth between 32% and 36%, which is expected to be driven by further increases in home standby production throughout the year, strong growth in clean energy markets, continued broad-based global demand for C&I products and contributions from recent acquisitions. Notably, this full year 2022 guidance projects an approximate doubling of Generac's revenue as compared to 2020 levels, with organic growth accounting for the vast majority of the increase. In addition to the significant top line growth, we expect to maintain attractive margins while continuing to make aggressive investments in next-generation energy technology solutions. We credit these accomplishments to the agility and dedication of the Generac team as we overcome short-term operational challenges and remain focused on our long-term purpose of leading the evolution to more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions. Now discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail. Demand for home standby generators in the fourth quarter continued to benefit from important megatrends, which further expanded consumer awareness of the category. The Home as a Sanctuary trend remains a key driver of demand, along with the impacts of more extreme weather resulting in elevated power outage activity over the past several quarters, including 3 major outages over the past 18 months. The combination of these factors, along with broader electrification trends, continues to drive incredibly strong demand for home standby generators. As a result, home consultations or sales leads increased again in the fourth quarter over the robust prior year comparison and for the year grew at a strong double-digit rate, and we're nearly 4x the full year 2019 levels. Activations of home standby generators, which are a proxy for installations, also grew at a significant rate compared to the prior year. And our distribution footprint ended the fourth quarter with 8,100 residential dealers, an increase of approximately 800 dealers over the last 12 months. As we have discussed, we continue to make encouraging progress increasing production levels for home standby generators, most notably at our new facility in Trenton, South Carolina, as daily build rates at all our facilities were dramatically higher when compared to prior year levels. Build rates also grew sequentially as we added a new production line at both the Trenton and Jefferson, Wisconsin facilities during the quarter. As a result of the higher output levels, lead times have declined by approximately 4 to 5 weeks from 32 weeks at the end of the third quarter. However, home standby order rates have remained very strong, leading to a further increase in our backlog, which currently is still well over $1 billion and provides excellent visibility into 2022 revenue growth. Output levels are projected to increase further throughout the year as additional capacity comes online. However, demand has remained strong. And although we expect to exit the year with improved lead times, we anticipate that we will still end 2022 with a significant backlog for home standby generators. Many of the same factors underpinning tremendous demand for home standby generators, along with the increasing penetration of solar installations, are also helping drive rapid growth for our clean energy products. As previously mentioned, shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems grew significantly in the quarter as compared to the prior year and also grew at a strong double-digit rate sequentially. Despite industry-wide supply chain and logistics challenges impacting our clean energy solutions, full year 2021 clean energy-related revenue approximately doubled as end-user demand remains robust for our PWRcell energy storage systems. In addition to strong revenue growth, key performance indicators for clean energy products continued to show favorable trends in the fourth quarter. Home consultation and system activations both increased at a strong rate over the prior year and also increased sequentially. In addition, we further built out our clean energy installer network as we ended the fourth quarter with nearly 2,500 trained and certified dealers with approximately 1,000 dealers registered on our PowerPlay sales platform. The solar plus storage market continues to expand rapidly, and we expect to see significant year-over-year growth again during 2022. Shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems are anticipated to increase substantially during the year. And we expect clean energy revenues to grow aggressively as compared to the 2021 levels. We're also very excited about beginning shipments of the previously mentioned new product introductions for clean energy, which are expected to contribute incrementally in 2022. This includes our new PV microinverter product offering called PWRmicro, with shipments expected to begin toward the end of the second quarter and ramping further during the second half of the year. A key component of future growth for our clean energy offerings is establishing and developing our distribution network, including partnering with large national solar providers. We recently announced an expansion of our partnership with Sunnova that adds even more of Generac's industry-leading technology to its current suite of offerings. In addition to energy storage systems, Sunnova customers will now have access to the industry's only fully integrated lineup of home standby generators, microinverters and load control devices delivered from a single equipment provider. The scope of the new agreement includes integrating both companies' software platforms, enabling the joint participation in grid services programs across the U.S. Additionally, Sunnova's consumer-friendly financing solution will now be made available to Generac's certified dealers for all their customers' financing needs, including home standby generators. We're very excited about our expanded partnership as it grows distribution capacity for our residential products, increases financing opportunities for potential home standby customers and facilitate additional growth in grid services. I'd now like to provide an update on the ecobee acquisition, which closed in December and which helps to accelerate Generac's evolution into an energy technology company. We believe we can leverage ecobee's existing technology and capabilities to develop a home energy management platform, which will be core to our growing residential energy ecosystem of the future that benefits both homeowners and grid operators. This platform will enable homeowners to make smarter energy production, storage and consumption decisions while also integrating with our Concerto software platform to provide grid operators more efficient access to a home's distributed energy resources. Importantly, while still very early, we are already starting to see near-term commercial synergies from the acquisition as the initial integration with our existing commercial sales channels has been encouraging, including expansion into Generac's residential and clean energy dealer networks as well as key retail relationships. In addition, ecobee has a sizable dedicated sales team directly engaging utilities and grid operators with their ecobee energy program, which is aimed at developing demand response and load control opportunities. Our Generac Grid Services team has begun working closely with this group to coordinate and expand these efforts to develop our sales pipeline together by leveraging ecobee's more than 2 million connected homes as a valuable installed base of potential distributed energy resources. I'd also like to provide a further update on Generac Grid Services, a group recently formed within the company that builds upon our October 2020 acquisition of Enbala Power Generac Grid Services has been making excellent progress in expanding its sales pipeline, including meaningful opportunities beyond traditional software-as-a-service contracts. The fourth quarter saw significant progress in new deals closed and in the final stages of negotiation, increasing our top line visibility for 2022. The Grid Services team continues to integrate Generac's products and solutions into the Concerto software platform, with the resulting hardware cross-selling opportunities expanding the sales funnel even further. We believe this creates a unique advantage for Generac in the market for grid services, given our increasingly unmatched set of energy technology assets and industry-leading derms platform, helping us to maintain momentum with utilities, grid operators and energy retailers while raising our profile with key decision makers in the utility industry. We also recently announced a key win for Generac Grid Services to build virtual power plants, or VPPs, by recruiting and enrolling Generac solar PV and battery storage system owners for Southern California Edison's PowerFlex program. This initiative gives SoCal Edison's residential customers the opportunity to earn incentives by allowing some of their carbon-free electricity stored in their PWRcell energy storage systems to be dispatched for grid stability purposes. Public sector support for grid services opportunities has been increasing, highlighted by the numerous programs within the recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that target grid flexibility and resilience and encourage utilities and grid operators to develop and manage virtual power plants using distributed energy resources. Now let me make some comments on our C&I business, which grew rapidly in the fourth quarter as key end markets and geographies continued to recover off the softer prior year impacted by the pandemic. Global C&I product sales increased 43% on an as-reported basis compared to the prior year and 30% on a core basis, which was well above 2019 levels during the quarter. Our domestic C&I products saw growth across all channels in the fourth quarter, led by national telecom and rental equipment customers. We also have a record backlog for C&I products, which increased further during the fourth quarter and has continued to build here in the first quarter, providing good visibility for another year of meaningful growth in 2022. Shipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel grew again at a solid rate. And the channel continued to experience strong quoting and order activity along with improving close rates and market share gains in the quarter. We're also experiencing strong growth with our Energy Systems industrial distributor business in Northern California that we acquired in 2020 as our investments and overall increased focus in this important backup power market are producing excellent results. In working to build on this success, in the fourth quarter, we acquired the Power Generation Group of Papé Material Handling, our industrial distributor based in Southern California, further expanding our presence in the large and growing West Coast market. Shipments to telecom national account customers increased dramatically again during the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year, benefiting from elevated levels of capital spending by several of our larger telecom customers. The catalyst for the investment in backup power in this important vertical continues to be driven by an elevated power outage environment, the power security mandate in California requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power and the build-out of 5G networks. The long-term demand outlook for backup power in the telecom sector remains very compelling, driven by the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications. We also experienced very strong growth with our national rental equipment customers as shipments of mobile products continued to recover at a significant rate off the pandemic-driven lows of 2020. These customers are investing heavily in fleet equipment, and we remain optimistic about the long-term demand outlook for mobile products given the mega trend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements. We expect that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in late 2021 will support a higher level of capital spending by rental equipment companies over the next several years. Additionally, we're experiencing ongoing strength in project quoting and improved close rates for our natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, such as their use in Energy as a Service, microgrid solutions and other distributed generation projects. Order rates for generators used in these applications increased dramatically during the full year 2021. We believe the increased interest in these products is being driven by the need for enhanced resiliency and grid stability that these large blocks of power offer for grid operators while simultaneously providing a tangible and meaningful return on investment for the asset owners. Internationally, we continue to see strong momentum as well with shipments increasing 47% year-over-year on an as-reported basis during the fourth quarter, with 26% core net sales growth when excluding the benefit of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency. The core sales growth was driven by strength across all major regions and has recovered well above the levels from 2019. Overall, quoting and order activity continued to accelerate at a strong pace in key international markets in the fourth quarter, driving growth in the international backlog and higher visibility for 2022. We have also seen a growing interest in home standby generators in certain international markets, highlighting the potential for the product category's addressable market to grow significantly beyond the still underpenetrated U.S. market. Cleaner burning natural gas C&I generators are also experiencing positive momentum internationally as we work to educate the global market on the benefits of natural gas fuel generators over their traditional diesel solutions. The International segment's fourth quarter EBITDA margin expanded to 13.9% from 6.8% in the year-ago period due to the accretive margin profiles of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions, improved overhead absorption on higher volumes and realization from pricing actions, which were implemented throughout 2021. The integrations of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions are progressing well as we continue expanding the reach of their energy technology solutions through our global distribution channels. Off Grid has seen very strong market interest for its mobile energy storage systems in new regions and with legacy Generac customers. And we are very excited to bring this innovative battery storage solution to the North American equipment rental market in 2022. The Deep Sea acquisition has substantially expanded our global controls and electronics engineering teams and provides important capabilities that are core to the growth of our portfolio of grid-connected Energy as a Service and microgrid solutions. In closing today, 2021 was a year of tremendous progress for Generac as we significantly expanded our capacity and further accelerated our evolution to an energy technology company with a number of key strategic investments across product categories and regions. We believe this growth has resulted in market share gains in every part of our business during 2021. And I'm extremely proud of the hard work of our teams to achieve such strong results despite the incredibly challenging operating environment. As we look forward, we believe we are just getting started on our newly introduced Powering a Smarter World enterprise strategy. Through the combination of aggressive organic investment and strategic acquisitions, we have built a portfolio of power generation and storage systems, monitoring and management devices, and platform and controls capabilities that provide for resiliency as well as participation in grid services programs, thereby creating enormous value for an increasingly broad range of stakeholders. With these solutions, in tandem with our services, our distribution, our brand and importantly, our expertise, Generac is uniquely positioned to be a leader in the ongoing modernization and evolution of our electrical grid to be more flexible, cleaner and smarter. I now want to turn the call over to York to provide some additional details on our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and our new outlook for 2022. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter and full year 2021 results in more detail. Net sales increased 40% to $1.07 billion during the fourth quarter of 2021, an all-time record as compared to $761 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The combination of contributions from the Deep Sea, Chilicon, Off Grid, Tank Utility and ecobee acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 5% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Net sales for the full year 2021 increased 50% to approximately $3.74 billion, also an all-time record for the company. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class. Residential product sales grew to $706 million as compared to $499 million in the prior year, representing a 42% increase despite a strong prior year comparable. Contributions from the ecobee and Chilicon acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 2% of revenue growth for the quarter. Home standby generator sales made up of the majority of the residential product growth, increasing by approximately 50% over the prior year as we continue to make significant progress in expanding production capacity for these products despite the challenging supply chain environment. Shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems also grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year as overall solar market growth, rising storage attachment rates and our expanding distribution continue to drive growth for our clean energy solutions. An increase in shipments of portable generators and shore products also contributed to growth in the quarter. Commercial and industrial product net sales for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 43% to $284 million as compared to $199 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency had a combined impact of approximately 13% on net sales growth during the quarter. The very strong core revenue growth was driven by an impressive growth across all domestic C&I channels in all major regions internationally. While this growth rate was aided by the softer prior comparison impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, our C&I revenue was up approximately 19% on a core basis as compared to 2019 levels, which highlights the strong demand that we are seeing across most C&I markets. Domestically, the C&I growth was driven by a significant increase in shipments to telecom national account customers resulting from the much higher capital spending as these customers continue to harden their wireless networks. We also experienced strong growth in mobile product shipments to our rental channel customers as they continue to invest in their fleets, given strength in their end markets. Also contributing to the increase was solid growth with our industrial distributors as well as higher shipments of natural gas generators used in Beyond standby applications. Internationally, the increase in C&I products was broad-based from a geographic standpoint, with growth in all major regions as global C&I markets continue to experience a sharp increase in demand of the softer prior comparison impacted by COVID and had recovered well above 2019 levels. Net sales for other products and services increased 21% to $77 million as compared to $64 million in the fourth of 2020, recall this service category is primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring and grid services subscription revenue and other service offerings.  Contributions from the ecobee and Tank Utility acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency contributed approximately 4% of revenue growth during the quarter. Strength in aftermarket service parts continues to be a core driver of sales growth in the category as heightened power outage activity and a larger installed base is driving increased demand. We're also experiencing higher levels of extended warranty revenue on a larger and growing base of extended warranty contracts. Also contributing to the increase were higher levels of remote monitoring and grid services subscription revenue as well as increases in other services. Gross profit margin was 34% compared to 39.4% in the prior year fourth quarter as the challenging supply chain and overall inflationary environment drove input costs significantly higher during the quarter. Specifically, the lagging impact of rising steel prices, inbound logistics costs and labor rates, along with the Trenton plant start-up, all pressured margins in the current year quarter. The early realization of initial pricing actions partially offset these margin pressures. Importantly, our backlog as of the end of the year contains multiple rounds of additional price actions that will be increasingly realized in the coming quarters. Operating expenses increased $58 million or 44.8% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, but declined approximately 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization and transaction-related costs. The overall increase in OpEx dollars was primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions, and related transaction costs, higher employee and marketing spend, additional variable expenses from the significant increase in sales volumes and increased amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was an all-time record of $220 million or 20.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter as compared to $196 million or 25.7% of net sales in the prior year. For the full year 2021, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interests came in at an all-time record of $861 million, resulting in a strong 23.1% margin that was similar to the 23.5% margin in the prior year despite the challenging operating environment and acquisitions that impacted margins during 2021. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 39% to $896 million in the quarter as compared to $645 million in the prior year, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $197 million, representing a 21.9% margin as compared to $188 million in the prior year or 29.1% of net sales. The lower domestic EBITDA margin in the quarter was primarily due to the significantly higher input costs and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the early realization of pricing actions implemented throughout the year. For the full year 2021, Domestic segment sales increased 52% over the prior year to $3.16 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 25.1% compared to 27.0% in the prior year. International segment sales increased 47% to $171 million in the quarter as compared to $116 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 26% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $23.7 million or 13.9% of net sales as compared to $7.8 million or 6.8% of net sales in the prior year. The significant expansion in international EBITDA margins was primarily due to strong margin contributions from the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions, improved overhead absorption and operating leverage as well as the impact of pricing actions. For the full year 2021, International segment sales increased 45% over the prior year to $573 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests were 11.5% of net sales during 2021, a 640 basis point increase compared to the 5.1% margin in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2021 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $143 million as compared to $125 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. GAAP income taxes during the current year fourth quarter were $20.6 million or an effective tax rate of 12.4% as compared to $39 million or an effective tax rate of 23.8% in the prior year. The decline in effective tax rate was primarily due to certain discrete items related to acquisitions and a higher stock compensation deduction during the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.04 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $1.97 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release was an all-time record $162 million in the current year quarter or $2.51 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $136 million in the prior year or $2.12 per share. Cash income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $29.7 million as compared to $34.9 million in the prior year quarter. The current year now reflects a cash income tax rate of approximately 19.7% for the full year 2021 compared to our previous expectation of approximately 20.0% to 20.5%. The decrease is primarily driven by a higher level of stock compensation deduction than previously expected. This full year cash tax rate for 2021 compares to the prior year rate of 17.9%. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus the prior year is primarily due to a significant increase in domestic pretax income, which is taxed at a higher statutory rate, along with an increase in nondeductible goodwill from acquisitions. Cash flow from operations was $62 million as compared to $218 million in the prior year fourth quarter. And free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was $42 million as compared to $191 million in the same quarter last year. The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a much higher working capital investment in the current year quarter, partially offset by an increase in operating earnings and lower capital expenditures relative to the prior year. The higher working capital investment was primarily driven by further elevated inventory levels at the end of the year, resulting from extended logistics in transit times, ongoing supply chain constraints, increasing production rates and continued investments in the ramping of our new Trenton facility. We repurchased 350,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter for $126 million under our current share repurchase program. And we have approximately $124 million remaining under this authorization as of December 31, 2021. At year-end, we had approximately $550 million of liquidity comprised of approximately $150 million of cash on hand and $400 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in May of 2026. Also, total debt outstanding for the -- at the end of the year was $980 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was only 1.2x on an as-reported basis. In addition, our term loan doesn't mature until December 2026, and we do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date. And it has a low cost of debt of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We also have interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. Further enhancing our overall liquidity is our strong cash flow profile. And for the full year 2021, free cash flow was $306 million. Uses of cash during 2021 included $744 million for acquisitions, including earn-out and non-controlling interest buyouts, $126 million for share repurchases and $110 million for capital expenditures. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation give us the flexibility to grow our business, execute on our strategy and invest in future shareholder value-enhancing opportunities. With that, I will now provide further comments on our new outlook for 2022. As Aaron previously highlighted, key demand metrics for most of our product categories continue to trend strongly during the fourth quarter, leading to a further increase in backlog as we exit 2021. Looking into 2022, we expect significant growth in home standby generator shipments as we ramp capacity in our Trenton, South Carolina plant. We also expect strong growth from our clean energy products as the solar plus storage market continues to grow rapidly and as we launch several important new products, including PWRmicro throughout the first half of the year. We expect C&I products to continue to benefit from strong and broad-based global demand, highlighted by domestic telecom, mobile and energy management customers and several key international markets. In addition, our 2021 energy technology acquisitions are expected to contribute meaningfully to our overall growth in particular, the ecobee, Deep Sea Electronics and Off Grid Energy acquisitions. In summary, we have tremendous momentum and significant visibility into our demand profile as we enter 2022. As a result of this positive top line outlook, we're initiating guidance for 2022 that anticipate significant revenue growth as compared to the prior year. Net sales are expected to increase between 32% to 36% as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis, which includes an approximate 5% to 7% net impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This revenue outlook assumes shipments of residential products increased at a low 40% rate during 2022 and revenue for C&I products is expected to grow at a high-teens rate compared to the prior year. Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outage activity during the year in line with the longer-term baseline average. As a result, consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year, such as a Category 3 or higher landed hurricane. Given we are expected to be producing at capacity for home standby generators throughout the year, the upside of a major power outage event would be more limited to incremental portable generator shipments during 2022. Meaning, any extra lift for home standby generators from a major power outage event would most likely result in incremental revenue in 2023. As Aaron previously explained, we expect to significantly reduce our backlog and lead times for home standby generators during 2022. But given the strong demand for these products, we still expect to carry a notable amount of home standby backlog into 2023. As we ramp capacity for home standby and clean energy products, we're expecting a certain level of quarterly seasonality during 2022, with net sales in the first half being approximately 47% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 53% weighted. Specifically related to the first quarter, we expect first quarter 2022 shipments to be similar to fourth quarter 2021 levels with increasing residential shipments being offset by seasonal impacts for C&I products. Looking at our gross margin profile as we enter 2022, we anticipate cost pressures from ongoing supply chain challenges, component shortages, higher logistics costs and an overall inflationary environment to further impact gross margins in the first quarter, resulting in a sequential decline in gross margins from fourth quarter 2021 to first quarter 2022. We expect many of these inflationary pressures to progressively ease as we move through 2022 for a variety of reasons. Steel prices have come off their recent peaks, and we expect freight costs will recede during the year as supply chain bottlenecks improve. Also, the realization of multiple pricing actions that we took in 2021 will have a meaningfully positive impact on gross margins, particularly in the second half, supported by our significant backlogs that contain higher pricing levels. In addition, the impact of plant start-up costs will continue to lessen as production at the new Trenton, South Carolina facility further ramps. Also, we expect to realize certain cost-reduction initiatives that began in 2021 to combat the significant increase in input costs, including important projects to improve the cost structure for certain high-volume product lines. These tailwinds should be increasingly realized on a quarterly basis as we progress through 2022.  For the full year 2022, we expect pricing, easing input cost pressures during the second half and cost-reduction initiatives to more than offset the continuation of inflationary cost pressures during the first half. As a result, we expect gross margins for full year 2022 to increase modestly compared to 2021 with sequential improvements throughout the year. Specifically, from a seasonality perspective, we expect price cost headwinds to hit peak levels in the first quarter of 2022, leading to trough gross margins that are expected to be approximately 100 basis points below fourth quarter 2021 levels. We expect quarterly improvements throughout the year ultimately leading to fourth quarter 2022 gross margins recovering back to first quarter 2021 levels. In addition, we continue to make significant operating expense investments to scale the business, support innovation and drive future revenue growth in new and existing markets. These energy technology investments and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2021 are expected to result in moderately higher operating expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year 2022 when compared to full year 2021. As a result of these factors and our gross margin expectations, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are expected to be approximately 22.0% to 23.0% compared to 23.1% reported for the full year 2021. This includes the combined impact from recent acquisitions that is expected to dilute adjusted EBITDA margins by approximately 150 basis points during 2022. From a seasonality perspective, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to improve significantly as we move through the year, primarily driven by improving gross margins throughout the year as previously discussed in detail and, to a lesser extent, improved leverage of operating expenses on the expected higher sales volumes. Specifically, regarding the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to bottom in the first quarter at approximately 250 to 300 basis points below fourth quarter 2021 levels and then improve sequentially throughout the year, returning to the mid-20% range in the fourth quarter of 2022 even when including the impact of recent acquisitions. As is our normal practice, we're also providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for 2022. As a reminder, our approximate $30 million per year tax shield that originated from the LBO transaction in 2006 fully expired at the end of 2021. As a result, 2021 was the last year that adjusted earnings will benefit from a notably lower cash income tax rate relative to the GAAP tax rate. Given that our cash tax rate is now expected to be more in line with the GAAP tax rate, we are now only going to guide to the GAAP tax rate going forward. For 2022, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 24% to 25% as compared to the 19.7% full year cash tax rate for 2021. This increase is driven primarily by the expiration of the previously mentioned tax shield as well as lower expected share-based compensation deductions in 2022 when compared to the prior year. In 2022, we expect interest expense to be approximately $41 million to $43 million, assuming no additional term loan principal payments during the year and assuming increasing LIBOR rates throughout 2022. Our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately 2.5% to 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. And depreciation expense is forecast to be approximately $56 million to $58 million in 2022 given our assumed CapEx guidance. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2022 is expected to be approximately $95 million to $100 million during the year. This is an increase compared to $50 million of amortization expense in 2021 due to the impact of acquisitions completed during 2021 that resulted in a significant increase in finite live intangible assets such as trade names, customer lists, patents and technology. Stock compensation expense is expected to be between $31 million to $34 million for the year. For full year 2022, operating and free cash flow generation is once again expected to follow historical seasonality of being disproportionately weighted toward the second half of the year. Given the very strong organic sales growth expected during 2022, we expect the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow to be approximately 70% to 80% for the year as a portion of cash flows will be invested in working capitals to support this growth. Our full year weighted average diluted share count is expected to increase and be approximately 65.3 million to 65.5 million shares as compared to 64.3 million shares in 2021. Finally, this 2022 outlook does not reflect potential additional acquisitions or share repurchases that could drive incremental shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tommy Moll from Stephens.
Tommy Moll: York, you gave some helpful insight on the growth and EBITDA margins and their progression through the year. I wanted to drill down on the home standby business. It sounds like their price cost should be a tailwind as you get into the second half of the year. I would think that once Trenton has scaled production there, that also ought to be margin accretive. So if you run it all through and things go according to plan, could you exit '22 with a higher margin on that business than you had put up in the past?
York Ragen: I mean I think, overall, what we guided -- what we're talking to and what we're -- our guidance anticipates is that our gross margins overall for the company get back to, I guess, what we're calling pre-inflationary environment. If you look at Q1 2021 gross margins of roughly 40%, our guide basically gets us back there in Q4. I guess I'd have to -- we haven't necessarily parsed that out by product category in our guidance and in our prepared comments. But I would think it would get back to at least similar margin where the pre-inflationary environment was earlier in the year.
Tommy Moll: Fair enough. Had to ask. Aaron, to follow up on Grid Services, you made some news last month with the virtual power plant deal you announced in about that deal specifically. And then you mentioned the funnel for Grid Services is pretty full for 2022. How many more of these do you think you could sign this year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. The Grid Services piece, Tommy, as we've indicated a couple of times, I think, publicly is -- the pipeline there is growing at a rapid pace. We're actually -- we've been expanding our sales force there. We've more than doubled the headcount in that business. We're closing in on 100 people that are focused on it every day. And that's without -- there's a dedicated team, a pretty large dedicated team at ecobee as well that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that's going to be helpful in some of the sales efforts there.  The challenge, of course, for Grid Service and we noted this during Investor Day, is just a long sales cycle. You're dealing with utilities and grid operators and folks that have -- they have a process for these types of programs, the process is and one-off approval through a regulatory agency or regulatory body in general. A lot of these programs, in some cases, to certain utilities and grid operators are completely new. So there's a pretty good sized learning curve here as well. But I would say that we're incredibly encouraged.  We talked specifically about the Southern California Edison PowerFlex program as kind of a proof point of some of the deals that are in the pipeline that are actually getting done. That one is not a huge program, admittedly. But it's a nice program for us because it helps us demonstrate not only to Southern California Edison, but we can use that program and the elements of that program, we can share that with other utilities.  I think a lot of utility companies are just struggling with what is the right equation for them. What's the right -- is it a demand management program? Is it some kind of grid support program? Or is it some other kind of -- some grid operators need help with frequency or voltage on the grid? And we can do that with a lot -- in particular, with our storage systems. Those things can be incredibly helpful to helping stabilize the grid, whether you're talking about voltage or frequency or you're talking about augmenting power generation or curtailing demand. We have basically a huge amount of flexibility in what we can design for programs.  So the kind of lack of formality around what type of program is needed by each grid operators, you have to work with them on informing that. And then the long sales cycle that goes into that, it's going to be a while before we see real, meaningful kind of impact from that in our results. Now we've contemplated that in the guidance we're offering today. And in fact, it's tracking very well, if not above, what we shared with you on the Investor Day back in September. But really encouraging stuff, but just a long sales cycle.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America.
Ross Gilardi: Can you guys quantify any more specifically what you're assuming for home standby backlog exiting '22? And just like what is a normalized level of orders for home standby in today's world? I mean really what I'm trying to get at is, I mean, do you have enough home standby backlog for your -- in your planning assumptions right now exiting 2022 to avoid a down year in 2023 without significantly above trend or year -- in '23. Hopefully, you followed all that, but I think you know what I'm asking.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean you're asking for 2023 guidance, right? No, I think I understand what you're saying. And so just a couple of comments, I think. We do think, as we said in the prepared remarks, we're going to end the year, this year, we're going to end the year with a pretty substantial backlog yet of HSB. Because we anticipate the order rate, which we've seen already so far this year and as we exited 2021, has been really strong. In fact, so strong that even though we've taken our production capacity up, we've continued to outstrip that and grow the backlog.  And we are going to grow our output throughout this year. We've got some pretty heavy growth, as we've talked about, our double-double, the theoretical capacity. We talked about how we're unsure how supply chain is going to be able to feed that, although we're getting more comfortable with that as the year progresses here. Again, based on our prepared remarks, we've got some pretty nice growth built into our forecast for the year. But that all said, we're still going to end with a pretty good backlog. The question of how much backlog is going to depend largely on the type of outage environment we see over the next 6 to 9 months as the year progresses. So if we get a heavy kind of -- or normal, I'll say, even outage environment over the summer months and into the fall, we may outstrip that even further and the backlog may be even bigger. So it's really difficult at this stage for sure, to kind of answer the question you're asking.  I do think, though, that what's changed is when we -- last prepared remarks, we weren't -- we thought we'd be out of backlog by the end of '22. And that has changed at this point based on the current demand environment and based on even though that we are adding more capacity. So really, it's encouraging on the one hand, and we do think we're going to bring lead times down, but we're not going to get back down to that normal kind of 1- to 2-week lead time as we end the year.
Ross Gilardi: All right. And then I just wanted to ask you about International. You made some interesting comments about growth and interest in international HSB. Where are you seeing that? And then your International EBITDA contribution has basically tripled from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. I think a lot of that M&A, but you finished the year with a 14% EBITDA margin in the second half of the year. If we carry that over into 2022, that seems like a pretty big a tailwind that I hadn't really thought about before. So can you talk more about like [Indiscernible] margins in the business.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, yes. So on the HSB side specifically, the markets we're seeing interest, there's a number of markets. But very specifically, down in South America, we're seeing it in Argentina. We're seeing it in Brazil. When you go kind of elsewhere, you expand your aperture to a global basis, we're seeing, obviously, Australia has been a market we've targeted for some time for HSB. We're starting to see growth there, which is very nice. Interest in Japan, which is interesting. We're seeing interest in Russia and Ukraine, which arguably might be related to some of the security concerns short term here.  But typically, this product category benefits from a concern over your power quality. And whether that concern is driven by weather or whether it's driven by geopolitical concerns or something else, we have seen a really interesting increase in the interest level. In fact, I would tell you that the teams over in Europe that are responsible for the rest of the world sales and marketing efforts, they want more product from us. And because of our production constraints here, they're telling us they could sell even more product if we get it in their hands. So we're very encouraged by that. Because I think largely, as we've all talked, this is the category has been primarily a U.S. -- North American focused element. And so to get outside of that, I think, is exciting. Now on EBITDA margins, that's really exciting because we've been pushing on this for a while. We took -- we were heading the right direction up until the pandemic hit. And then our international EBITDA margin kind of stepped backwards as we lost top line volume. As volume returns, and this is -- strip out for a second the acquisitions, take out Deep Sea and Off Grid, which have -- they're accretive from a margin profile, no doubt. But actually, the core ROW business as we refer to are our international segment, without those acquisitions, actually was up as well.  So we're really encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of progress on our march towards improved EBITDA margins in that business. Then you add in the acquisitions, and like you said, we ended the year into the almost 14% in the fourth quarter. And we believe that is going to be a nice -- if you call it a tailwind, I call it kind of getting on finally on with where we want to be with this business longer term with EBITDA margins. But we're encouraged by it. And again, home standby generators, because of the margin profile of those products, certainly helps our natural gas C&I generators. They become -- are becoming popular there, also help. They're accretive to margin and then the acquisition. So we put all of those together, plus just improvements in the general core business that is the ROW business, we're very pleased with where we're going with EBITDA margins there.
Operator: And our next question comes from Philip Shen from ROTH Capital.
Philip Shen: Just following up on one of the last questions around demand. You just mentioned, Aaron, that where you thought backlog would be by end of '22 is meaningfully higher now versus the last time you hosted a call. And so given the demand signals that you're seeing and given the supply constraints and outlook for freight improving and so forth, where do you stand now with capacity expansion? Are you closer to making a decision? Do you think we could get something beyond the Q2 '22 double-double sometime soon? And if so, what's the timing and the magnitude of what that expansion could be?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Phil. And obviously, we continue to watch that very closely and continue to make the necessary moves we think are important to make timing-wise. As we mentioned on the last call, we made a commitment to invest in additional tooling for production of our alternators, which is one of the constrained areas in ramping production further or ramping output further. We made that commitment because of the long lead times of those machines. At this point, that automation equipment is out 50, 60 weeks in lead times. So we've got that on order. We don't necessarily have an address on what we're going to deliver it yet.  But it would -- based on the timing of that, it would be sometime in 2023. Early 2023, we'd have to find a home for that. We're considering whether we can add that to our existing footprint and maybe take some of the raw material or even finished goods storage that we do in the facilities we use today, maybe move that to off-site. So we're looking deeply at the home standby capacity footprint to figure out how we're going to effect that next leg up.  But we have put in motion kind of the longer lead time items that make that possible. So I feel good about that. And we continue to invest in additional automation in our existing operations and additional capacity. We mentioned -- and we've talked about this at some time, we really are producing home standbys in 3 facilities now. The intent, of course, being once we ramped our Trenton facility, we would go down to 2 facilities. We kind of absorb what we're doing today on a bit of a temporary basis in Jefferson, Wisconsin. We'd absorb that into Trenton more fully.  We are looking at should we keep that third facility running and should we expand it even further. In fact, in our prepared remarks today, we added another line in Jefferson in the fourth quarter. We also turned on another line in Trenton during the fourth quarter. So the Trenton one was contemplated. The Jefferson one was planned as well, but we've got those up and running now. And my point is with this is that, the Trenton one could become more permanent as a way to expand capacity beyond the double-double. So yes, and that plus the additional tooling investments that we're committed to, we think we're going to be in really good shape, at least, to have taken care of some of the longer lead time items that make that possible as we get to early '23.
Philip Shen: Great. And then as it relates to Chilicon and the PWRmicro, it sounds like you're ramping in Q2. Can you talk about how the channel is receiving that yet? Does the channel yet have the samples to be able to test and get the inverters on the approved vendor list for different companies and financing partners? And just curious on what kind of demand in terms of megawatts or revenue we could see from Chilicon in Q3 and Q4?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Phil. We're super excited about the PWRmicros. We think this is an opportunity for Generac to begin to really fully participate in the clean energy markets beyond just the storage markets, which have been really good so far and really encouraging so far as storage attachment rates continue to climb. But we know there's still a substantial number of PV-only type of systems going in that today we don't participate in. So the PWRmicros are our way to do that. The Chilicon acquisition was our pathway. We're making really good progress on the redesign of the initial Chilicon, the original Chilicon microinverter design. They had a really great design. The guys at Chilicon, super bright guys, had developed what we think is, frankly, we think it's industry-leading technology. And in fact, the approach, the 2:1 microinverter, 2 panels to 1 microinverter, we think is an important part of kind of the value prop of the product going forward.  We're on target for a Q2 launch. And so we feel good about that. And as we said in the prepared remarks that the -- where you'll start to see the benefit of that or will experience the benefit of that is really in the second half of this year. We haven't given specific guidance on that yet. We have a lot of supply chain work ahead of us here to ramp. And as you know, a lot of the components that go into those types of products, on the electronic side, semiconductors, processors, microprocessors, there are supply chain constraints that have formed for everybody in the industry and we’re no different. We're working through that, and we're talking to our supply chain partners today about how to be ready for the second half and to scale.  We do expect to get in early in the second quarter, get the samples into beta test sites for our channel partners. Receptivity by channel partners, by the way, continues to be incredibly strong. They are very excited to see us enter the market. And I think it really rounds out our product offering. It's that product supermarket approach that we've talked about so much that I think from a single provider to be able to offer everything from generators to storage systems to PV inverters to load control devices and integrate that on a single pane of glass, like we're planning on doing here and then expose all of that through our Grid Services teams, there's nobody in the industry that can do what we can do, by the time we get to the second half of this year with the product launches we've got that being a key one, of course.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brian Drab from William Blair.
Brian Drab: I'll just ask one question here. Aaron, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the dynamic, I guess the dynamics that are impacting the dealer count and how it's flattened out. I think, obviously, that's -- and I think you've talked about this related to new dealers not being able to get product right away that they won't give them the lead times. So how do you view that playing out? And I'm wondering if this, in the end, sort of spring loads growth into '23 in the home standby category? Because as the lead times come down, certainly there's an inverse relationship there with the dealers. And then all of a sudden, you get a little bit of extra growth because you're growing that dealer base again.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's a great question, Brian. Thanks for bringing it up. The pipeline for new dealers remains very strong. Our challenge, of course, has been fulfilling those orders for new dealers because of the backlog. So as the backlog was extended as it is, we're doing everything we can to get product to those folks, but it did flatten out at the end of the year here. We still added 800 in the full year, which is more than we've ever added in a single year. But I think you bring up a good point. I mean there's no question that continued expansion of that channel is critical to our growth. I mean we need that installation bandwidth. We need that sales bandwidth. We need that service and support bandwidth as the install base grows.  So we are laser-focused on continuing to grow that channel. And it is arguable that maybe it does spring load that a bit for 2023 -- or 2022 here. We didn't necessarily kind of speak to it that way. But it's -- I think it's probably the right way to think about it. And that's an incredibly important area for us and is getting a lot of attention. And I think we're going to find our way through to continue to grow that throughout the year here even, hopefully, as we increase our production capacity, that certainly helps us satisfy those new dealers with product. Because the last thing we want to do is sign a dealer up and then we can't deliver to them. I mean that's a demoralizing experience for the dealer. So we've got to focus on that as we get into 2022 here.
Brian Drab: Is there some sort of lead time threshold that you think you need to get to where that starts to -- where dealer count starts to grow again?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think you're going to see growth. I mean just naturally, I mean, you may have seen a little bit of a flattening out here in the back half of the year simply because of the lead times being extended. But as I mentioned, lead times are actually starting to come down. In fact, they're down 4 to 5 weeks from where they were at the end of Q3. So that, as it comes in, I don't think it's going to remain flat. I think it's going to accelerate here as we get out of -- as we exit 2021 and get into 2022, you will see dealer counts begin to pick up again.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc.
JeffHammond: Just maybe talk about, I think you gave kind of residential commercial, but maybe just how you're thinking about growth rates in storage this year, clean energy all in? And then just give us your view on kind of the California net metering proposal and how you think it impacts battery storage short term and long term?
York Ragen: Jeff, I'll start there. As I highlighted, embedded in the 32% to 36% overall growth guidance, I mentioned residential products will increase in the low 40% range. Embedded in that is clean energy. We do have aggressive growth plans. We doubled that business here. And from 2020 to 2021, we've got aggressive growth plans here in 2022, well north of 50% growth. So we're excited about that. So that will be accretive to our overall residential product growth overall.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And then, Jeff, just on the California, net metering situation is playing out there, really interesting for me personally. I mean I've gotten a front row seat to this. For the first time, we're involved. I'm on the -- there's a war room for the CEOs in the industry on this NEM discussion. It's being sponsored by California Solar and Storage Association, CALSSA. And so this is kind of our first kind of foray into the debate around policy changes that impact the industry.  And clearly, the concern there is a valid one in terms of the draft resolution that's been put forth by California Regulatory Commission there, the CPC. And so I personally, as a provider of storage, we think that this net metering fight is going to play out everywhere. I mean this is like the early innings on what's going to happen when solar hits a tipping point. You do run up against the fact that you need to kind of take a hard look at the incentive structure that net metering provides to assure a fair and equitable incentive structure going forward, yet you don't want to dampen obviously enthusiasm for renewable energy. So there's got to be balance in that. And I think the industry recognizes that. And I think what -- the proposed draft that was put out on California NEM 3.0 clearly doesn't achieve balance. And I think that's the concern.  That being said, I do think that as the battle for NEM plays out and as you find balance, it's going to drive storage rates higher, which is good for us. In the short term, we actually are underexposed in California. So it probably doesn't hurt or help us in California much initially here. But over time, this net metering fight is, if you want to call it that, or this debate, is going to play out. It has highlighted for us something though important, and that is that I think we need to have a stronger voice in the debate around policy as a company. I think we've probably taken a bit of a lower profile there than we should.  And so we're starting to lock shoulders, lock arms here with the industry and go shoulder to shoulder with others to kind of, one, really become deeply knowledgeable on the policy-related things that are going on in the industry; and then try to figure out how we impact it, how we impact it positively for the broader industry as well as for Generac and our customers, so -- and our dealer partners. So I think we are going to be investing in policy and investing in the regulatory forefront more so than we ever have. But it's been really interesting to see this kind of first hand.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. Great. And then in your Analyst Day, I think you put out 2024 EBITDA margin targets of 24 to 25 And clearly, we've had this unprecedented supply chain price cost, which seems like it's going to get better in the second -- into the second half. Some acquisitions coming in, most notably ecobee. Just how should we think about same or differ around that target as you look at it today?
York Ragen: Yes. Jeff, this is York. As I mentioned on the EBITDA pacing, we're looking at Q4 EBITDA margins in our guidance to be somewhere in that mid-20% range, which is for a fourth quarter, that's a seasonally strong quarter. But looking out, I don't see any -- now that we'll level set and reset the margin profile with the pricing actions we've implemented and maybe with some moderation in some of the inflationary pressures here, we should get back to sort of the cadence that we've been thinking about all along in our Investor Day, that 24% to 25% EBITDA margin longer term.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Mark Strouse, JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse: You've been raising pricing 3 or 4x now over the past year. Your backlog continues to build. Just curious at a high level once we eventually get to the other side of the raw material pricing and the shipping pricing coming down, what is your strategy on pricing to your customers? Do you bring down cost equivalently? Or do you kind of leave pricing where it is and try and juice up your margins a bit?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Mark, I think there's a -- within that question, there's a lot of moving pieces, obviously, on where do costs go. Is the inflationary environment transitory? The PPI, yesterday, it was a 9.7% read on an annualized -- for the last 12 months, and so 10%. And costs are up dramatically if you look at our business. And I don't think all of it's read through yet personally. I think this is the problem with the Fed. And the problem with these statistics is they're backward looking and they're lagging. You're looking at data that's dated.  Every new contract that comes up, I don't care if it's for snow plowing, grass cutting, delivering materials to the facilities, trucking, if it's -- everything that we do is higher. All the insurance renewals. Everything else is coming in, every time we get a new renewal, software cost, they're higher. So inflation is going to continue to kind of read through I think 6 to 12 months, again, in spite of what economists and other talking heads say. I mean they should really go work for a company because it's really just easy. You just look at all the costs. I said this a year ago. There's no way this is transitory. Wages are going up. Wages don't go back down. It doesn't happen, sorry. And we look at some of the costs and some of the inputs, they're not going back down. They're structural. So it's not that hard. And I think a lot of these folks just get tied up in the data.  So my point on all this is the pricing we put in was to help us neutralize these cost increases. That being said, we didn't put as much pricing in as costs have gone up because we are going to work very hard this year to offset that with some notable cost-out projects. We've got some big projects that we've been working on. We actually initiated them last summer when we saw costs really starting to climb that are going to help us kind of not have to fully bake in the pricing to offset dollar-for-dollar the cost increases. So where do things go from here? Let's hope that they come down at some point, and we're able to bring our pricing down. We want products to be affordable. We think that's an important tenet of growing the category going forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joseph Osha from Guggenheim Partners.
Joseph Osha: I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the trends you're seeing in consultation activity around the country. I've heard in the past that you were seeing some interesting growth in consultations in parts of the country that hadn't necessarily been big markets for you in the past, and that might signal some higher growth in places like California, for example. So I'm wondering what kind of trends you're seeing now, what that might signal in terms of how in the U.S. your sales shape up this year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. No, thanks, Joe. It's a great question. And obviously, we call them IHCs, in-home consultations. We are seeing a move towards more virtual nature there. But on a year-to-date basis, as we said, I mean, we saw 46 states that had growth in IHC counts. And I mean it's amazing how widespread the growth was, how broad-based it was. In the fourth quarter, there were a couple of regions that we did see a little bit of cooling off and a couple of regions that were just, again, really strong. Regions like the Midwest, regions like South Central and the Western regions continue to be very strong with consultations. Some of that could be that some of those areas have -- individually, there are some states underneath some of those areas that maybe have lower install bases or lower penetration rates, so they're kind of catching up to the averages. Whereas maybe some of the other regions like the Northeast and Southeast might have a little bit above kind of national average penetration rate, so maybe they're slowing down a little bit.  I mean a lot of that is based on what's been experienced in that region directly. That's our history with IHCs. But still phenomenally, I mean, for the whole quarter, up double digits again for the quarter across the country. So just a really strong read on IHCs. And I think it portends really well. And it gives us confidence in the guide that we're issuing this morning around 2022, given that kind of front-end interest that we're seeing in the product category.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jed Dorsheimer from Canaccord Genuity.
Jed Dorsheimer: Congrats on a great quarter and outlook. Aaron, I guess, my one question is just around Grid Services and the BPP -- and the deal you mentioned with SoCal Edison, the -- which is obviously on renewable. And my question is, Europe is proposing to reconstitute both nuclear and nat gas as clean energy. And Europe has kind of been a leading indicator for some of the trends here. So I'm wondering your capacity that's out there in the field seems to be over 20 gigawatt hours of capacity. Most of that's nat gas. I'm wondering how your discussions are going around moving that over from a BPP perspective or whether or not that's still a roadblock because it's nat gas powered.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Joe, it's a great question. We're really encouraged by seeing that move in Europe to kind of redesignate, if you will, nat gas and nuclear as "clean or renewable." And I mean it's -- look, and you follow the energy markets and a lot of folks on this call do as well. I think we all understand the importance of continuous sources of baseload power. We want to clean it up as much as we can. We want to move to lower intense forms of energy, lower carbon-intense forms of energy. Natural gas provides for us an awesome opportunity to do that and move away from things like coal and move to natural gas and nuclear and other forms that dramatically change the profile of baseload power in the context of how clean it is versus today. And especially as we go to electrify everything, right?  I mean our dependence on electrical power, just electricity in general, you think of a typical home today, and we depend on not only electricity, but we -- oftentimes most homes depend on natural gas for heating or for cooking. And certainly, with transportation, we depend on gasoline. I think having those 3 fuels provides for some flexibility. If we go to relying on a single source going forward, the challenge with reliability becomes -- I think it's going to be incredibly risky to do that.  Back to your point though, your point in terms of the conversations we're having here in the U.S., I think most of the utility operator and grid operators, they understand it. Maybe they're not able to publicly say it that nat gas is something that needs to be around. And you've got these movements afoot kind of local community to local community where they're trying to ban new natural gas connections, which is ridiculous. It's completely shortsighted. And it actually serves -- it serves us negatively as a populist to do this.  And so I think it's well intentioned, but I think the outcomes are really -- are going to be very undesirable. So the conversations are happening. That fleet of product that we have is really desirable. And I'm excited that we're going to be able to connect those products, as we said, through our smart grid ready technology, we're going to make them available and exposed to use in BPP programs like what you're seeing in SoCal Edison and in a lot of other places.
Operator: And our next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Just a quick one, a lot's been asked. I'm curious if the guidance assumes that Trenton's running full throughput at the targeted capacity for the second half or if you have some more gated assumptions there just based on all the factors required to make Trenton hum at that -- to accomplish that double-double.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Chris. So the simple answer is that you've got 2 types of capacity, a theoretical capacity and then you kind of have your real world or realized capacity, right, like what you can actually do. And so theoretical capacity is a bigger number than what we planned for here. And again, because we've got -- again, we've got a pretty good line of sight on everything we need. But you've got labor -- potential labor constraints. You've got potential supply chain constraints, logistics constraints. We've baked in, if you will, a hedge. I don't know if that's the right word to use. People can call it whatever you want to call it. But we are planned below the theoretical capacity of the facility for the balance of the year.  Now if we get some breakthroughs on that, could it be higher? Potentially. And we're obviously shooting for higher numbers. And we want to get to that theoretical capacity. I think it's always difficult to run a facility at a theoretical capacity number. You very rarely ever run a facility at 100%. You're always generally running it at something less than 100% because of the real-world implications of doing that. You need downtime for equipment repair and maintenance. You need -- you have people come and go in terms of whether it's illness or whether it's something else, you have the human limitations there. And you try and put all that into the modeling, if you will, and that's what we come up with as kind of our real-world capacity, which is below the theoretical capacity of the facility.
Operator: And our next question comes from J.B. Lowe from Citi.
J.B. Lowe: Why don't we talk about -- I mean, obviously, there's good -- there's some pretty decent visibility on the resi storage. But was wondering what you guys are thinking -- how you guys are thinking about the opportunity on the commercial storage side and then also just international expansion for the battery product.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's -- J.B., it's great. The Off Grid Energy acquisition has been -- that was our first foray into commercial storage. It's generally the product they have, the form factor of the product is really ideal for the rental market. So it's modern on a trailer. It can be paired with a mobile generator so you can charge it right there in the field. And then you can run off of batteries, particularly useful in construction sites, especially when you get into metro areas where it's difficult to run kind of generators at night or you have noise restrictions, things like that. These products are -- have become very popular. And we're just now introducing them here in the U.S.  So we've got a couple of our national rental account partners that are really excited to add them to their fleets. So we're going to be putting that equipment here in the U.S. But we're also introducing Off Grid to all of our rental customers through our Pramac group, which is our ROW Group in Italy. They have the European rental market is quite well developed. You get into the U.K., you get into any of the European Mainland countries, and we have a lot of great relationships there because we provide backup generators or construction generators as well as lighting towers, water pumps, things like that. So we've got a really great history with those customers, both, again, here in the U.S. as well as in Europe. And the Off Grid products are being incredibly well received.  So our first foray into storage is kind of geared towards the rental market. We are taking those products that we're developing a road map for stationary storage. That puts us kind of into, I would say, it's more akin to what we do in the C&I generator market globally. And that's not necessarily what the Off Grid product is geared towards today. But in the future, the road map would give us a product that would look like kind of storage for those stationary C&I applications. So more to come on that as we develop that, but really good kind of early innings here with storage for C&I.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kashy Harrison from Piper Sandler.
Kashy Harrison: So back at your Investor Day, you provided the multiyear outlook on the revenue CAGR through 2024. Obviously, it's only been a few months since that color was provided. But I was just wondering if you could maybe walk us through some notable developments in that multiyear view since that Investor Day that you think might be worth pointing out? Have there been any big developments we should be paying attention to? And if there are, what's -- what are there?
York Ragen: Yes. No, this is York. I'm thinking out loud. We've been talking about how our backlog coming into 2022, and therefore, ending the year in 2023 is going to be probably higher than we were anticipating back in the LRP period that we launched in September of last year. So that obviously will be a tailwind there as you progress through the model. ecobee was not in the LRP model. So you'd layer that on top. That's probably the biggest development that wasn't in the LRP model. It's just our strategy around ecobee and developing a home energy ecosystem and all the synergies that will come with that. That's probably the biggest thing that's not in LRP.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, I would agree with that. And I think the fact that -- I think maybe not fully appreciated in the LRP, in my prepared remarks today, I said based on our read of the markets that we participate in, we gain share everywhere across the board. And that might not have been fully contemplated in the LRP as well. Just those share gains -- share gains tend to be pretty sticky. So when you are picking up share, you kind of -- that has a compounding effect in out years. So that could be a positive tailwind. Although I think York is right. Probably the bigger tailwinds there would be the higher anticipated backlog for HSB exiting '22 and the ecobee acquisition, which clearly really wasn't baked into the LRP model last September. But good question.
Operator: And our next question comes from Donovan Schafer from Colliers Security.
Donovan Schafer: I want to focus on international markets here. So acquisitions from, say, 2010 to 2018, were really focused on building an international footprint to benefit from megatrends like the shift from diesel to natural gas generation. And now it looks like this is really starting to play out for you. But I want to hone in on what specifically have you seen in the last year, leaving aside COVID because I know that had an impact. But within, say, the last year, what's really been driving this and what could we see or what would you expect it to drive over the next, say, medium term, 3 to 5 years? And I just want to kind of trout some candidates of kind of factors. The LNG market has been growing very aggressively. Brazil and Argentina, I think those are LPG markets. So could that be part of what drives things there. Japan has been talking about developing offshore methane hydrate for years now. India launched a pilot program for residential natural gas distribution. So from that whole grab bag, what do you think are the most important things?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Donovan, I really appreciate that. And you're spot on. I mean over the last 10 years, the last decade is about giving -- is about building the footprint, right, and building the team, building the capabilities to deliver products, manufacture and deliver products into the markets whatever those products may be. Our long-term view was always around HSB products, potentially C&I natural gas products and of course, more recently, clean energy products, whether they’d be storage and we're demonstrating this, right?  Just in my comments -- just on -- with the previous question around Off Grid Energy, the ability to take those storage systems and put them in the hands of our teams where we already have business, where we already have customers, where we already have distribution in those countries, the comments I made in the prepared remarks about HSB expanding and then that we talked about here on the Q&A about markets like Argentina and Brazil. And you're right, it's where you see markets where natural gas is expanding. India is another market opportunity for us longer term. I didn't talk about that, but there's a lot of new pipeline capacity being put online, and it's definitely on the drawing board right now in India. Now it's got to get through the regulatory processes and things in India.  But nonetheless, natural gas is an enabler. LPG markets are an enabler for many of these products. And it fits right in with what we're doing. We said -- we always said that the -- our effort in investing globally was always about the long term. And when we said long term, we meant decades. We didn't mean years. It's starting to play out, which we're really happy to see some of these things in the near term. But longer term, I'm not going to speak specifically to like 3- to 5-year type of growth rates, but we're incredibly encouraged by the interest level in these products. And we haven't even gotten to our entire portfolio of clean energy assets yet and getting those in the hands, residential storage, PV microinverters in these other markets where we certainly know, especially in markets like Europe, and in Australia, where they're a lot more developed. We think we have opportunities there, and we are going to execute on those opportunities in the years ahead.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Michael Harris for closing remarks.
Michael Harris: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2022 earnings results with you in late April. Thank you again, and goodbye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-02 10:00:00) =====

Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We experienced another quarter of exceptional demand as interest in our home standby generators, clean energy systems, and C&I products remained incredibly strong. Production levels were also the highest we have ever experienced in a quarter with shipments of home standby generators increasing at a substantial rate over the prior year, as we continue to ramp output at our new facility in Trenton, South Carolina.  This led to record revenue growth of 34%, in spite of significant operational obstacles faced across the supply chain environment that deteriorated further during the third quarter. Even with the higher output levels, demand remained very strong and broad-based, leading to higher backlog levels, particularly for home standby generators, providing us with good visibility and a significant revenue growth for 2022. Additionally, we recently announced several strategic acquisitions that will accelerate our new Powering a Smarter World strategy, and provide additional avenues for growth as we continue our evolution into an energy technology solutions Company.  Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 34% to $943 million, an all-time record, and also increased sequentially relative to the second quarter, which was the previous all-time record. The growth in the quarter was driven by strength in both residential and C&I products as compared to the prior year. Residential product growth was led by a 50% increase in shipments of home standby generators, as production levels continued to increase significantly relative to prior year levels, as well as tremendous year-over-year growth in shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems, which also grew double-digits on a sequential basis. Shipments of C&I products were also up dramatically in the quarter, with revenue of these products now growing materially above 2019 levels due to strength across a number of end markets and geographies.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Adjusted EBITDA margins of 22.2% were lower as compare to the prior year, as they were unfavorably impacted by higher logistics and commodity costs. In response to the escalating costs we are experiencing, we've undertaken a number of additional pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives to mitigate the longer-term impact to margins. Now, discussing our third quarter results in more detail, the megatrends driving consumer interest in backup power continued in the third quarter. Most notably, the Home as a Sanctuary trend, combined with more extreme weather, which again resulted in elevated power outage activity. Overall, baseline outage activity for the trailing 4 quarters grew on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, despite a very strong prior year comparison and remains well above the long-term baseline average.  In fact, since we began tracking the impact of outage activity more than a decade ago, four of the top ten power outage severity quarters have occurred since the second half of last year. The convergence of the heightened power outage activity, broader electrification trends, and people spending more time at home has driven unprecedented demand for home standby generators. As a result, home consultations or sales leads increased again at a strong double-digit rate in the third quarter over the robust prior-year comparison and broad-based growth continues to be experienced as almost all U.S. regions grew on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. It's also relevant to note that home consultations in the third quarter increased over three times the comparable 2019 levels. And on a year-to-date basis are more than 4 times 2019 levels. Activations of home standby generators, which are a proxy for installations, also grew at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year. We continue to experience a strong expansion of our distribution footprint as we ended the third quarter with approximately 8,100 residential dealers. An increase of 1,100 dealers over the last 12 months. California and Texas alone continue to account for nearly 1/3 of the year-over-year increase. Early in the third quarter, we achieved a significant milestone by starting production of home standby generators at our new facility in Trenton, South Carolina. We continue to make encouraging progress increasing production levels for home standby generators across our operating footprint, with daily build rates much higher compared to prior-year levels. Despite the higher output, demand for home standby generators continues to outpace our ability to produce them, which has caused lead times to further grow to approximately 30 weeks.  These significant lead times provide excellent visibility as we head into 2022 with our home standby backlog projected to be well over $1 billion entering the next year. As we consider the longer-term capacity requirements for home standby production, we have made a number of strategic decisions to further expand our footprint. Yesterday, we announced plans to expand warehousing and distribution capacity at our trend facility by adding 200 thousand square feet, which will increase the current size of building by nearly 50%.  In addition, we recently made commitments to purchase additional lead -- long lead time automated manufacturing equipment that would be available to come online in 2023. Further increasing our capacity for several key components to provide for needed surge production as the category continues to grow. In addition to these capacity expansion actions, last week we introduced the industry's largest air-cooled home standby generator, our new 26-kilowatt unit.  Building upon the success of the launch of our 24-kilowatt unit last year, the new 26-kilowatt unit will allow homeowners to access the kind of power only previously available in larger size liquid-cooled generators at a significantly lower cost. As the trend to decarbonize accelerates, the electrification of everything in the home, including heating, cooking, cleaning, and ultimately transportation, will lead to much greater residential electricity consumption.  The new 26 kilowatt home standby unit will be capable of providing the kind of resiliency needed with these larger electrical load s and will provide an ability to future proof a home as these electrification trends intensifies in the years ahead. With a strong outage environment and megatrends like Home as a Sanctuary underpinning tremendous demand for home standby generators, those same factors, along with the increasing penetration of solar installations, are also driving rapid growth for our clean energy product offering. As previously mentioned, shipments of our PWRcell Energy Storage Systems grew significantly as compared to the prior year. It also grew at a double-digit rate sequentially. Despite numerous supply chain challenges also impacting clean energy products, we continue to experience growth well above the broader U.S. residential solar market, driven by ongoing increases in storage attachment rates and continued market share gains. In addition to strong revenue growth, key performance indicators for clean energy products continued to show favorable trends.  Home consultations expanded as compared to the prior year and accelerated throughout the quarter. System activations, which are a proxy for installations and commissioning more than doubled in the third quarter as compared to the prior year, and also increased sequentially. In addition, we further build out our installer network as we ended the third quarter with approximately 2,300 trained and certified dealers with nearly a thousand of those dealers registered on our PowerPlay CE sales platform.  Despite the industry-wide supply chain and logistics challenges, we expect clean energy revenues to approximately double for full-year 2021 on a year-over-year basis. In addition, we continue to drive profitable growth within the product category as we scale volumes and optimize the supply chain. Building on the early success we've experienced with our clean energy product offering. We formally announced several exciting new clean energy related products during the third quarter that we believe will further grow our competitive advantage in this exciting new market. We introduced the industry's first purpose-built dedicated battery charging generator during the quarter, the power generator, which is a one-of-a-kind power product enabling a homeowner to create a Solar Plus storage system that is completely grid independent. We also introduced our new PWRmanager load control system that maximizes battery performance and offers homeowners the ability to control specific electric loads from a mobile device via our existing PWRview energy monitoring platform. And building off the early integration success with the recent Chilicon acquisition, we introduced the PWRmicro, a Generac branded microinverter that allows us to fully participate in the residential solar only market.  A meaningful expansion beyond the solar plus storage space we previously addressed. In another example of our focus on continued innovation, we announced the acquisition of Apricity; an advanced engineering and product design Company focused on developing energy technology solutions. The team at Apricity brings expertise in designing and prototyping energy-related products to increase reliability, add functionality, and improve performance.  The Company has also developed a unique smart water heater controller that is used as a grid edge device by utilities in demand response and other energy conservation programs. Bringing this talented group on board will accelerate our efforts in expanding our clean energy offerings, and increase our speed-to-market for key clean energy and grid services products and solutions.  To further build upon Generac 's evolution into an energy technology solutions Company, yesterday we announced an exciting agreement to acquire Ecobee, which accelerates our capability to provide a home energy ecosystem with a dual value proposition for both homeowners and grid operators. Ecobee is a pioneer in the smart thermostat market, and offers a full line of intelligent thermostats and home monitoring products that delivers significant energy savings, security, and peace of mind and enable the monitoring and control of a significant portion of the home's electrical load, residential HVAC systems represent the single largest energy consuming device in the home today.  And Ecobee has created an intelligent system using smart thermostats and sensors to effectively balanced comfort and conservation with over 5 million connected devices in more than 2 million homes, Ecobee customers in North America have saved more than 20 terawatts of energy, which is the equivalent of saving enough energy to take all the homes in Los Angeles off the grid for an entire year. Importantly, Ecobee adds to Generac 's growing suite of residential power generation, energy storage, and energy management solutions that we believe will play a pivotal role in helping to solve the challenges of the growing supply and demand imbalances of today's electrical grid.  Smart thermostat controls represent one of the largest opportunities within the grid services addressable market involving the connection of grid edge devices to a grid services platform like our Concerto software platform, thereby enabling participation in grid services programs. Adding Ecobee 's devices to our product portfolio considerably expands our served market opportunity and increases our capabilities, provide end-to-end solutions for Turnkey Virtual Power Plant Projects. Adding Ecobee 's, innovative team of over 500 employees, gives us the ability to further advance the development of an intelligent and intuitive user interface platform.  That would integrate and synchronize our generation and storage equipment, and our existing grid edge devices. Providing seamless access and control for homeowners through a smartphone, tablet, or PC. We believe this approach will create one of the broadest home energy ecosystems available on the market today and allow for easy connection to our Concerto platform, empowering homeowners to make smarter energy production, storage, and consumption decisions, while providing grid operators more efficient access to the home in aggregate or at the device level for grid support programs. I'd also like to provide a brief update on Generac grid services.  A new group within Generac that was formed in the third quarter that builds upon our October 2020 acquisition of Enbala Power Networks. Generac grid services was established to directly engage and serve utilities, energy retailers, and grid operators to provide an array of solutions, and enable entirely new value streams that leverage a range of products from our portfolio. We took another major step toward unlocking significant value in the grid services space in the third quarter with the formal announcement of Smart Grid Ready capabilities across our home standby generators, our C&I natural gas generators, and our PWRcell Energy Storage Systems. In addition to the peace of mind that they're receiving from Generac products, customers now have the opportunity to also obtain additional return on investment by leveraging their products to support grid reliability, resiliency, and sustainability. Within the expanding grid services marketplace, we believe Generac grid services is a unique and differentiated market leader due to our comprehensive set of hardware plus software plus services offerings, including,  through our smart grid ready capabilities for legacy products, our recent acquisition of Apricity smart water heater controllers, and our pending acquisition of Ecobee and its home energy management solutions. Our increasing integration of hardware with grid software and services is leading to a number of contracts wins, along with a significant increase in proposal requests and an overall expanding sales pipeline.  These include several examples of the new revenue streams within our grid services model as we layer on higher-value turnkey virtual power-plant programs, utilizing Generac hardware and performance contracts on top of the Concerto software-as-a-service platform. We are in the very early innings of the evolution of the power grid, but as consumer awareness grows, and demand from utilities and grid operators materializes, we remain incredibly excited about the potential long-term growth trajectory of Generac grid services. The excitement around our expanding energy technology solution capabilities extends into the C&I product range as well. Where offerings such as energy-as-a-service, microgrid Solutions, and Mobile energy storage systems, are helping drive the long-term growth trajectory and an increasing mix of energy technology revenues.  Our core C&I business experienced strong momentum in the third quarter as a number of end markets and geographies continue to recover strongly off the COVID weakened prior-year quarter. Specifically, C&I product sales grew 47% as compared to the prior year, and 31% on a core basis. We also have a considerable backlog that is growing for C&I products that provides good visibility for meaningful growth heading into 2022.  In addition to strong quoting and order activity in our North American distributor channel, shipments to telecom national account customers increased dramatically again during the quarter as compared to the prior year, as capital spending by several of our larger telecom customers continued at elevated levels and have led to further increase in project shipments during the current year.  The catalyst for the additional spending on backup power in this important vertical continues to be driven by an elevated power outage environment over the last several years, the power security mandate in California requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all tower locations, and the build-out of wireless carriers 5G networks.  The long-term demand outlook for Telecom backup power remains very compelling driven by the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications. We also experienced very strong growth within our national accounts -- national rental account customers as shipments of mobile products continue to recover at a significant rate of the COVID-driven lows of 2022 -- 2020, excuse me, 2020.  We still expect shipments of mobile products to improve dramatically for the full-year 2021 as the prior year, as national rental account customers invest heavily in fleet equipment, with utilization and rental rates continuing to improve. We remain optimistic about the long-term demand outlook for mobile products, given the important megatrend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could benefit from the potential economic stimulus plans being pursued through the federal infrastructure spending bill. Additionally, we continue to build great momentum with our C&I beyond standby initiatives.  We are experiencing ongoing strength in project quoting for our natural gas generators using applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation. Such as their use in energy-as-a-service, microgrid solutions, and other distributed generation applications. During the third quarter, we announced a five-year agreement with Enchanted Rock to build and supply the advanced natural gas generators and control systems that are used in ultra-low emission, dual purpose microgrid that Enchanted Rock designs and operates.  These solutions provide commercial industrial, and governmental customers with affordable and reliable backup power, and supply electric grid operators with critical grid stability services that accelerate the adoption of wind and solar without sacrificing overall grid reliability. The microgrid solutions are based on Generac's rich burn gaseous engine technology and our newly acquired Deep Sea Electronics control systems, which provides Quick Start, utility grade backup power in a much cleaner format when compared to traditional diesel generator solutions.  We remain very optimistic regarding customer and grid operator interest and beyond standby applications of our C&I natural gas generators. It's being driven by the need for enhanced grid stability and real -- and resiliency that these large blocks of power can offer, as well as the tangible and meaningful return on the investment opportunity for asset owners. Our international business continues to see strong momentum as well, with net sales growth of 61% on a year-over-year basis during the third quarter, and 32% core net sales growth, when excluding the benefit of the deep sea and off-grid energy acquisitions and the impact of favorable foreign currency. The core sales growth was driven by strength across all major regions that continued to experience a sharp increase in demand off the prior-year COVID lows, and have also recovered well above 2019 levels. Larger project floating and overall order activity continue to recover at a strong pace in key international markets, which drove growth in our international backlog during the third quarter, with the order strength continuing thus far in the fourth quarter. In addition, the segment's third quarter EBITDA margin expanded to 14.1%. From 7.9% in the year-ago period due to the higher margin profile impact from the deep sea and off-grid energy acquisitions and improved operating leverage in the base business on higher sales volumes.  With regards to off-grid energy, this acquisition closed on September 1 and brings a diverse range of energy storage solutions that provide cleaner and more flexible energy for industrial and mobile applications. Off-grid provides us an entry point into the rapidly growing market for industrial great energy storage systems and accelerates our hybrid generator and C&I Energy storage product roadmap.  Off Grid continues to see robust demand for its products in its core European markets and working -- and we're working to bring you solutions for the rest of our geographic footprint given our strong global relationships with rental equipment customers. Our integration efforts are off to a strong start with some legacy customers across Europe having already placed orders for Off Grid products highlighting early momentum in the sales synergies that we expect to realize. In closing today, we have tremendous momentum in our business as we close off the current year and head into 2022 with incredible home standby demand, and expanding energy technology solutions portfolio, a growing grid services sales pipeline, and strong global demand for our C&I products.  This provides support for yet another year of significant revenue growth with recent pricing and cost initiatives driving an improving margin profile. Day-to-day execution and navigation and the supply chain challenges clearly remains a near-term priority for our teams. But we're also keeping a clear focus on our new long-term powering a smarter world strategy with our ultimate purpose to lead the evolution to a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy solutions.  Through the combination of aggressive organic investment and a series of strategic acquisitions over the past 3 years, Generac is uniquely positioned with our products, our services, our distribution, our brand, and importantly, our expertise to deliver the solutions necessary to facilitate the transition to the next-generation electrical grid. Importantly we retained significant financial flexibility to further invest and expand our capabilities and continue to advance our evolution into an Energy Technology Solutions Company. I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on Third Quarter results and our updated outlook. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at third quarter 2021 results in more detail, net sales increased 34% to $942.7 million during the third quarter of 2021, an all-time record, as compared to $701.4 million in the prior-year third quarter. The combination of contributions from [Indiscernible] Enbala, Deep Sea, Chilicon and Off Grid acquisitions, and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 4% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the third quarter by product class, residential product sales grew 6 -- grew to $608.8 million as compared to $458.9 million in the prior year, representing a 33% increase despite a strong prior-year comparable. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continued to experience robust year-over-year growth, advancing by 50% during the third quarter as we made further progress, increasing production levels for these products, despite challenging supply chain headwinds.  Shipments of PWRcell Energy storage systems grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year. As storage attachment rates and market share gains continued to drive growth of Generac's clean energy solutions. This growth was partially offset by a decline in shipments of portable generators, which faced a strong prior year comparison from a record level of shipments to the hurricane in the prior year. Commercial and industrial product net sales for the third quarter of 2021 increased 47% to $258.3 million as compared to $176.2 million in the prior-year quarter.  There was an approximate 15% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impact of the Deep Sea and Off Grid acquisitions along with the favorable foreign currency. The very strong core revenue growth was in part aided by the soft prior-year comparison due to COVID-19 pandemic. However, C&I revenue also grew approximately 7% on a core basis as compared to 2019 levels.  The strength in core sales was driven by growth across a number of end markets and geographies as demand is recovering at a strong rate, both domestically and internationally in the following areas. Domestically, the growth was driven by a substantial increase in shipments to Telecom national account customers due to much higher capital spending levels from these customers as they continue to harden their wireless networks and prepare for 5G rollouts. Also contributing to the increase was strong growth from mobile products to our rental channel customers, as they are investing heavily in their fleets due to higher utilization and rental rates.  We also experienced higher shipments of natural gas generators used in beyond standby applications. Internationally, the increase in C&I products was broad-based from a geographic standpoint, most notably in Europe and Latin America. As these markets continue to experience a sharp increase in demand of the prior-year COVID laws and have recovered well above 2019 levels. Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring and grid services subscription revenue, and other service offerings increased 14% to $75.6 million as compared to $66.3 million in the third quarter of 2020.  There was an approximate 4% benefit in net sales during the quarter from the impact of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. Heightened power outage activity over the past several quarters continue to drive strong growth in aftermarket service parts. A larger and growing install base of our products and higher levels of extended warranty revenue also contributed to the increase versus prior year. Gross profit margin was 35.6%, compared to 39.4% in the prior year third quarter, as higher input costs had a significant unfavorable impact during the quarter. Specifically, rising commodity prices, labor rates, and logistics costs along with the Trenton plant start-up, all pressured margins in the current year quarter. The early impact of pricing actions partially offset these margin pressures with the full impact expected to be realized throughout 2022, as these price increases worked through our backlog.  Operating expenses increased $41.9 million or 34.8% as compared to the third quarter of 2020, but declined 13 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible [Indiscernible] due to the substantially higher sale volumes on the current year quarter. The increase in OpEx dollars was primarily driven by additional variable expenses from a significant increase in sales volume, higher employee cost and marketing spend, and the impact of acquisitions. Specifically, recurring OpEx from the Mean Green, Enbala, Deep Sea, Chilicon, Apricity, and [Indiscernible] acquisitions, related hiring amortization expense, and incremental transaction costs during the current year quarter.  As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting [Indiscernible] non-controlling interest as defined in our earnings release, was $209.2 million or 22.2% of net sales, as compared to $178.8 million or 25.5% of Net sales in the prior year. This EBITDA margin decrease was largely driven by the aforementioned decline in gross margin. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our 2 reportable segments. Domestic segment sales increased 30% to $791 million, as compared to $607 million in the prior year quarter, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 1% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $187.7 million, representing a 23.7% margin, as compared to $171.4 million in the prior year for 28.2% of net sales. International segment sales increased 61%, to $152 million as compared to $94 million in the prior-year quarter.  Core sales, which excludes the favorable impact of acquisitions and currency, increased approximately 32% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment, before deducting for non-controlling interest, was $21.5 million, or 14.1% of Net sales, as compared to $7.4 million or 7.9% of Net sales in the prior year. The strong growth in international EBITDA margins was primarily due to the favorable impact of the Deep Sea and Off Grid Energy acquisitions and incremental operating leverage on the higher sales volumes.  Now switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2021 on a consolidated basis as disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP Net Income attributable to the Company in the quarter was $131.6 million as compared to $115 million for the third quarter of 2020. GAAP income taxes during the current year quarter -- third quarter were 32.6 million or an effective tax rate of 19.7% as compared to 32.1 million or an effective tax rate of 21.8% for the prior year.  The decline in effective tax rate was primarily due to a discrete tax item resulting from a higher stock compensation deduction during the current year. Diluted net income per share for the Company on a GAAP basis was $1.93 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $1.82 for the prior year. Adjusted net income for the Company, as defined in our earnings release, was $151.1 million in the current year quarter, or $2.35 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $132.9 million in the prior year, or $2.08 per share. Cash income taxes for the third quarter of 2021 were $31.3 million as compared to $23.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The current year now reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 20% to 20.5% for the full year 2021, compared to our previous expectation of approximately 21% to 21.5%. The decrease primarily driven by a higher-than-expected level of stock compensation deduction. This expected full-year cash tax rate compares to the prior-year rate of 16%, that was anticipated after the third quarter of the prior year. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus prior year is primarily due to a significant increase in domestic pre -tax income, which is taxed at a higher statutory rate. Cash flow from operations was $74 million as compared to $155 million in the prior-year third quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release was $42 million as compared to $148 million in the same quarter last year. The decline of free cash flow was primarily due to a higher working capital investment in the current year quarter and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in operating earnings versus prior year.  The higher working capital investment was driven by elevated inventory at the end of the current year quarter, resulting from extended logistics in transit timing, continued supply chain constraints, ramping production rates, and the startup of our new Trenton, South Carolina facility. Updating our liquidity position as of September 30th, 2021, we had $873 million of liquidity, comprised of $424 million of cash on-hand and $449 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility.  Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter was $910 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was only 1.1 times on an as-reported basis. Further enhancing this attractive capital structure is our strong cash flow profile, with free cash flow over the last 12 months of $455 million. I would now like to provide some additional details on our outlook for full-year 2021. As mentioned in our press release earlier this morning, we are maintaining our full-year 2021 Net sales growth guidance range of approximately 47% to 50% compared with prior year, which includes approximately 5% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. The expected benefit from acquisitions is moderately higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the Off Grid Energy, Tank Utility and Ecobee acquisitions not included in our previous guidance. Updating our margin outlook for the full year 2021.  As we've discussed, we are continued experience significant supply chain challenges, logistics delays, and rising commodity prices which are resulting in higher input costs relative to our previous guidance. As a result of these factors, we're -- we now expect gross margin for the full year '21 to decline approximately 150 basis points as compared to the prior year which compares to the previous expectation of approximately flat versus the prior year.  Due to the reduced gross margin outlook, adjusted EBITDA margins, before deducting for non-controlling interest, are now expected to be approximately 23.5%, which compares to the previous guidance of 24.5% to 25%. As a result, we expect to maintain EBITDA margins compared to the prior year, despite the significant margin headwinds and acquisitions executed during the current year.  Providing some quick comments regarding our initial thoughts looking into 2022, the Company's consolidated backlog has increased considerably since reporting our second quarter results. Most notably for home standby generators, but also across a broad range of other residential and C&I product categories. For example, and as Aaron mentioned, our home standby backlog alone is projected to be well over $1 billion entering the new year.  The substantial overall backlog expected at the end of this year provides support for another year of projected significant revenue growth in 2022 with an improving margin profile as we begin to realize the full impact of various pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives. Throughout 2021, we have implemented multiple rounds of price increases across all product categories with differing realization legs depending on lead times.  We expect increasing realization of all 2021 pricing actions throughout the first half of 2022 with the full benefit realized by the second half of 2022. We also are pursuing certain cost reduction initiatives to combat the significant increase in input costs, including important projects focused on profitability enhancement, and continuous improvement activities. We will now provide additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for 2021. As mentioned previously, our cash income tax rate is now expected to be between 20% to 20.5%, which compares to prior guidance of 21% to 21.5%. GAAP intangible amortization expense for 2021 is now forecasted to be approximately $45 to $47 million, as compared to the previous guidance of approximately $49 million, with the decrease primarily due to updated purchase accounting adjustments related to recent acquisitions. Stock compensation expense is now expected to be approximately $26 million to $27 million, as compared to previous guidance of $24 million primarily due to the impact of additional acquisitions since our second quarter update. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 22% to 22.5% for the full-year, compared to the previous guidance range of 22.5% to 23.5%. The decline is primarily due to a higher level of stock compensation deduction during the current year. Our fourth-quarter weighted average diluted share count is now expected to be approximately 64.5 million shares, assuming in December 1 closing of the Ecobee transaction. This concludes our prepared remarks at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we would like to take any questions you might have for us today, [Operator Instructions]. Please note that analysts are allowed one question and one follow-up question only. Thank you. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. This will only take a few moments. We have our first question, comes from the line of Tommy Moll from Stephens. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Tommy Moll : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Tommy.
Tommy Moll : Aaron, I wanted to start on Ecobee, specifically on the go to market there, how do they go to market or how have they gone to market historically? How is that change when you took it as into your portfolio? And when you think about the edge that Generac will bring as the owner of this business going forward where there's some fairly stiff competition, how would you frame that for us?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, thanks for the question on that, Tommy. Ecobee is going to be -- I think we'll look back a couple of years from now and that's going to be a really critical turning point for us as we continue on this journey. as -- the evolution we talked about anyway, of becoming an energy technology Company. Specifically on your question on distribution, what we really like about them is that they refer to their go-to-market or their distribution strategy as omnichannel, which is exactly what -- how we would refer to our own. They sell through retailers, big-box retailers, they sell online those platforms, they sell through dealers.  They have over 40,000 HVAC contractors that represent them in the marketplace so really a pretty wide net in terms of just the way they go to market. They sell to distributors, HVAC distributors, so it's really, truly omnichannel. We like that, it fits well. We think there's going to be a lot of interesting synergies there. our electrical channel can certainly install a thermostat, and conversely their trades can install some of our other products as well. So, we think there's a really good fit there. The thermostat market, if you just look at thermostats, the definition, you're right, it's a pretty big market. This is truly, I would say beyond that though. This is about the intelligent thermostat platform and the smart thermostat platform. And there are only a handful of true competitors to what Ecobee does. Ecobee created this category.  Basically, Stuart Lombard, the person who runs that business up there, great entrepreneur, began that business in 2007, and by 2009 they'd introduced the market's first true smart thermostat. And others have joined. You're right. But I think what -- when we think about our differentiation going forward, the combination of the smart thermostat as just 1 of the elements of -- as what we keep referring to as a home energy ecosystem, right?  This is more than just the thermostat. It's more than just a water heater controller. It's more than just a single storage device or solar on the roof top or a generator, or a load management device. This is about the integration of all of those things. And what we really like about Ecobee is it gives us a platform, and it gives us a team of over 500 people up in Toronto that are steeped in user interfaces and user experience, that is what we need to bring all of these assets together to combine them in a single pane of glass for view and control by the consumer and then for easy attachment to grid programs through our Concerto platform.  We think that this is the middle layer that is, it's much more than just a thermostat. It's the middle layer that we need going forward to bring all of this stuff to bear as the grid continues to change and as the home energy ecosystem continues to develop. We're -- I'm just really excited about this. It is a cool product. If you've ever look at the product itself and just the quality of it, the premium look and fit and finish to the product itself and the platform, if you've ever used the Ecobee platform, it's definitely, I think going to be a really cool platform to put all of our devices into.
Tommy Moll : Thank you, Aaron. That's very helpful. As a follow-up, I wanted to talk to your HSB business, where recently at the Investor Day, you gave some directional insight on really favorable cost per lead trends. So you're still supply constrained there, notwithstanding some major efforts to alleviate that bottleneck. But if you weren't supply-constrained in this environment, Aaron, how many more sales and marketing dollars could you deploy efficiently into that customer acquisition funnel? We talking 25% more dollars, 50%?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think what's interesting Tommy, is we really haven't backed off on deploying the dollars even though we are supply constrained. And this is maybe why the lead times continue to grow, which is not what we want to see for our customers. But I think we've got our arms around some really good longer-term plans here to continue to expand capacity. All the things that were -- that we have been working on, that will come online next year and then -- we made some pretty big commitments here in the third quarter very recently.  Around not only the expansion on the trend facility, which I think is an important commitment, but commitments towards additional automated manufacturing equipment to help us scale even further there. But your question is a good one, I would tell you that our marketing team watches the statistics very closely. And if they were to see the cost per lead starting to change right around where we're spending and where we're deploying dollars, they would throttle back the spending, and so far that really hasn't been the case.  So I think what people sometimes don't realize is a home standby generator project was already a long term -- a longer, I would say project timeline for most people, because there's permitting involved, there's contractors involved, you have the work itself, you have inspectors. Clearly, it wasn't seven months before, but it generally was two or three months. And I think if people realize in today's environment that we are supply constrained in a lot of things, not just home standby generators, appliances, vehicles, you name it and it's tough to find things today.  So I think there's -- call it an acceptance level, I don't know what it is, but I think people are somewhat accepting the fact that they have to wait. And I also think it also speaks to just how in tune people are with the importance of having backup power. The outages have been increasing, they've been lasting longer. I think people are spending a ton more time in their homes and they realize just how vulnerable they are and what that means to, you know, the ability to work from home, their kid's ability to learn from home.  All the things that we need to do from home only happen with a continuous source of power. So I think a generator is just going to be -- it's going to be an appliance that we all have here going forward. We're going to need that as the grid continues to change and that's why we're committed to expanding our capacity. We've got a lot of confidence in where this is going longer-term. And I think that, as it relates to marketing dollars, we're going to continue to spend there too as long as it makes sense financially.
Tommy Moll : Thanks, Aaron. I appreciate the insight and I'll turn it back.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ross Gilardi: Hey, good morning. Thanks, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Ross.
Ross Gilardi: I just had some questions on some of York's preliminary comments on the 2022 revenue growth. Just want to see if I'm thinking about it right. But it would seem that if you deliver the backlog alone, and I think in critical planning assumption that you had the Investor Day was to work that backlog down to essentially 0 by the end of 2022, $1 billion plus backlog. That alone is close to 30% revenue growth next year. Am I thinking about that correctly? And from the installer and distribution perspective, are you confident that you've got enough distributors and installers on the ground right now that could get those all installed, or do they just end up sitting in limbo for a period of time?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. Hey, Ross, this is Aaron. I'll take some of those questions and I'll kick it to York here too, if he wants to jump in. Maybe just on the backlog, I think directionally you're thinking about it, right? We've got -- clearly we're going to have a bigger backlog coming into '22 than we originally thought because demand has just been stronger. It's outstripping supply. We're hitting record output levels on HSP. We could go higher if not for some of the -- a lot of our constraints here are pure logistics related, just the nuttiness of getting components from Point A to Point B right now.  Just the amount of dwell time that's going on with components in the ports and trying to find trucks, everything else you've heard about from every single Company in America. We're no different and that is -- that's kind of holding us back a bit, but we think that's temporary, that will resolve. We're confident that we'll get our feet under us as a country here around getting our supply chains repaired.  But directionally, you're right, I think the real question is, we talked about this double-double in terms of our capacity, that's theoretical capacity. If the supply chain constraints persist into the first half of next year, that could obviously create some headwinds, right to what we originally thought of, in terms of ultimate theoretical capacity. So that's something we've got to watch. Longer-term, again we feel like we've got a good plan to go even higher, to go even further with home standby capacity, we've got the confidence to do that.  I think you may have hit on something though it's really important here, is in the distribution network in terms of installation. We have 8100 dealers today. We're growing that number. We've grown to 1100 dealers over the last 12 months. The most in any last 12-month period we've ever grown and we're going to need to grow a lot more.  The reality of it is we're going to have to pick up the pace of installations so that we can keep pace as we deliver more products going into next year. Now remember that dealers aren't the only people who do installations. Installations are also done generally by contractors. There's over 70,000 electrical contractors out there, and there's over a 100,000 HVAC contractors. And both of those trades do HSB installation. So it's beyond just our dealers.  They do the lion's share, but it's also other trades that are involved who may not be dealers for us. So we have a pretty wide availability of contractors, but we really need to do a lot more training, We need to find more dealers and we've got, I would say an outside effort and outside focus on that for next year. I don't know, York, if there's any additional comments you want make?
York Ragen: [Indiscernible] what if the supply chain environment next year and will we catch backlog next year, I think it's all a function of what the supply chain look like and what the outage environment look like. So I think that would be my [Indiscernible]
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's setting up to be a monster year just based on the backlog we've got alone.
Ross Gilardi: Okay. Great. Can I ask a follow-up question?
York Ragen: Yeah.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah.
Ross Gilardi: The original plan -- well, I did say original, at least last quarter, was to get EBITDA margin back to Q1 '21 levels in the fourth quarter, and obviously that's changed as it reflect in your guidance, but do you get back there in the first half of '22, and can you give us sense of where the run rate pricing contribution to revenue growth entering next year?
York Ragen: I think, as I mentioned, we've had multiple rounds of pricing across all categories, I mean, with home standby, there was roughly 4 that went in place earlier in the year, call it December, January, and another may call it May, June, another one September, another one we're contemplating recently. When you think about how all the -- those are going to pace into next year, the May increase, well, we'll start seeing that probably the beginning of 2022.  The September increase we'll actually see because that was on shipments will start -- we'll see that here in Q4, that was a smaller one. The one coming up here that probably won't realize until let's say July given our lead times. I think -- and then you look at other products were also we've rolled out pricing as well. I think -- I would say by the end of the first half of 2022, we'll get full realization of all of our pricing, that should get us to gross margins that where -- at least look more similar to where they were in the beginning of the year, we're putting our budgets together as we speak, so not giving clear guidance as to what that looks like, but --
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's definitely going to improve.
York Ragen: -- it will definitely improve.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And will do that sequentially throughout next year. I would say, Ross, it's interesting, as we unpack this, the way that the costs rose so rapidly, in particular around logistics. I mean, that was -- and steel, certain commodity costs that are heavy in our products. Two things happened: 1. We got -- we had this -- we've just got long lead times on the products. So getting pricing to realize we were somewhat constrained there just because of the outside demands for HSB in particular.  But then also I would say our cost lags if you will, have shortened because we're burning through material so much quicker, the pace of production is increasing at such a volatile pace where I think lags of increases in the past with commodities and other things might have taken us a while longer to get through and start to show and read through in the EBITDA margins or even the gross margins. They're reading through quicker right now. So temporary, we got a good plan to get ahead of it. I'm feeling really good about where we are going to be next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Shen from ROTH Capital. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Philip Shen: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The 1st one --
York Ragen: Hey, Phil.
Philip Shen: Hey. Thanks again. The first one's around capacity. You announced that expansion in Trenton yesterday. Just want to check to see if that was a part of the double by 2020 to Q2'22. And then you mentioned Aaron, that you've secured equipment for 2023. So I was wondering if you could expand on whether or not you've made the decision on capacity expansion beyond the Q2'22 double? Have you guys locked in supply chain agreements which I believe are critical And have you made any commitments there? And then finally, the Jefferson facility, I think you guys have converted that to being permanent. Is that key for reaching that Q2 '22 to double as well? Thanks, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Got it. Thanks, Phil. Yeah. Capacity in HSB, let's just run through a couple of things in your question. The expansion at Trenton first. That expansion add 200,000 square feet to that facility, that is really about warehousing and distribution. I wouldn't say it would impact our double-double at all. What it is representative above is our confidence that we are going to be able to run at an elevated rate down there for an extended period of time. We would have had to do the adds warehousing and distribution, and to that with 3PLs, by bringing it in-house, we just -- we get a nice payback on that project pretty quickly; so that just made a lot of sense, and I think it's indicative of the longer-term feelings that we have about, not only Trenton.  We like the facility, we like the labor pool, but also just the category, home standby in general. Now, on the additional capacity that we talked about on our prepared remarks with the long lead time automated manufacturing equipment, really what's going on there is we've talked, Phil, we have some internal components we manufacture, of which the tooling to make that equipment has just gotten crazy long. I mean, we're talking 60 to 70 weeks long in terms of ordering them the equipment and getting it delivered and starting to run it off.  So what we're doing there is, we're basically saying, "Look, we have confidence in the category. We have confidence in the demand we're seeing. Let's get our tooling on order. " We don't even know where we're going to put the tooling, right? We're not exactly sure if it's going to go in maybe another expansion of Trenton, or maybe we squeezing into Whitewater, or maybe we put it in Jefferson, and I'll address that here in the second, or maybe it's a whole another facility, we don't really know yet. What we do know is it will allow us to go further than the Double-Double that we talked about. So it gets us set up to do that.  So now, we start the rest of the ground game that has to get done there around supply chain, around all the other elements that have to fall into place. And we'll be able to provide more color on that as we get closer to it. But we just -- we felt like we had to take the first step here. Given the lead times on that equipment, we just wanted to get -- make sure that we got ahead of it. And we didn't want to get in a situation where we couldn't react. So we're putting our markers down for the future there. And then on Jefferson, you're right.  We took a facility where we're making portable generators, power washers, chore products. And we've added capacity four HSB. We added another production line there. We're recently in the third quarter. so we're producing more out of Jefferson and we anticipate producing more as we end the year here. If you recall, we mentioned that we're going to the outside for some key components that we normally manufacture so we spooled up some components on the outside. Those are going to start to be delivered here in the back half of the fourth quarter and they're going to go to Jefferson where they're going to help us increase capacity there.  Whether or not we continue to do that long-term, I think we're going to continue it for the foreseeable future for certain night the next 12 months. I think all of '22 we'll be producing HSB in Jefferson and likely into 2023 depending on what kind of backlog if we're able to knock the backlog out next year, which is looking less than less likely just given where the demand is. It just keeps coming every day. It's amazing, And so where that demand ends up, where we may end up for the year in 2022, will dictate how we feel about '23. And then some of that will be about where we put that new tooling as well, so more to come on that. But definitely taking the next steps that we think we need to be able to go far beyond that existing double-double that we've talked about for capacity on HSB.
Philip Shen: Great. Thank you for that. As it relates to Ecobee, based on our industry checks last night, we're guesstimating that the revenue run rate is call it $30 million to $50 million, and the Company's probably running up break even. Are we in the right ballpark here? And if so, what kind of [Indiscernible] growth could you see for Ecobee in 2022? And finally, how are they managing through the chip shortage? I'm guessing they're having some issues there as well. Perhaps that's a near-term challenge, but something that they worked through overtime. Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah -- no -- that's a -- good questions, Phil, and again, we're really excited about this one. Now, Ecobee is quite a bit bigger than that. So they're about probably close to a 125 million in reps and that's supply chain constrained. Your point on chips, they could be going higher than that, but they do have, as you would imagine, some supply chain constraints, so they are working through those like we all are. And we're adding additional chip capacity across that product line. Stuart and his team are doing a nice job in navigating that. Their growth rate is going to be about 3x.  The Generac growth rate as we laid it out in the LRP model for the Investor Day. So we've got a lot of aggressive growth on the table. That's not only devices, but it's also services. So pretty exciting. That's a lot of growth coming out of the services piece going forward. But no, it's actually -- I call it a startup that's getting to scale. They've been around 14 years and they've spent a lot of time getting to this point and they've really started to see an inflection here in the last couple of years. They are still in investment mode.  They're generating operating losses today and we will continue to do so. We're going to continue that investment cycle over the next couple of years. It's probably going be a couple of years before they break even, so -- but that doesn't worry us. We think it's an important investment to continue to make, not only around their existing platforms, around the home energy monitoring, but also again around integration and synchronization of all of our assets that are part of our home energy ecosystem going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Brian Drab: Hey, good morning. First, can you just talk about the supply chain issues that you might be facing or could face as you try to ramp capacity additionally, setting up the new distribution warehouse, any of the equipment that you need. We're talking a lot about supply chain issues with as it relates to building generators, but just getting the equipment that you need into these facilities, how is that going?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, Brian. That's great question. We're still -- we're actually pacing pretty well with the existing equipment that's been on order. The new equipment that we've ordered here recently and committed to, part of the reason why that equipment is out longer on lead times is due to some component shortages. There's -- these are automated systems, so there's a lot of logic and a lot of chips and they're struggling with that.  But the existing systems that we're bringing on here at Q1 and Q2 of next year are still holding in there in terms of the timeline. We feel good about that. No material delays there. The rest of the supply chain challenges, whether it be building out that -- the Trenton facility or some of the other things that we're trying to do here, I think we've effectively -- we've built that into our assumptions around the timing of when those things will become meaningful to us or when they'll become -- when they'll come online.  It's really the near-term true component supply chain that's been -- that really deteriorate in the third quarter. When we sat there, even when we talk to everybody at our Investor Day. I mean, just what it did from the end of -- the middle to the end of September, to the end of October was disappointing, right? Just the bound of ships at anchor on the West Coast, just the trucking challenges, the rail challenges, the port challenges. the amount of additional time it's taking to get things here.  Forget about the cost to get it here, which is mind-numbing as well. But the time, it's really the time factor to get it here. I'm really hopeful that that's going to start to turn around here over the next 60 days, I'm hoping are going to be better. We're hearing indications that perhaps, things have bottomed on that side in terms of just where they've been and hopefully that'll improve on a go-forward basis. But every day it seems to be something different than we're fighting a fire on.
Brian Drab: Thanks. And then as a follow-up, the mind-numbing costs. Can you -- maybe this is for York, but can you quantify what you expect the excess transportation costs to be in 2021? And if we move into a world in 2022, where that starts to subside, I'm just trying to get a sense for how helpful that could be to your financial model for next year.
York Ragen: Just looking at the gross margin reduction here in Q3 -- gross margins reduced over 3%. That was predominantly all price cost as a headwind. And then just looking forward into Q4, that's another something similar, almost 4% price costs that are impacting us in Q4 of year-over-year. So, if that moderates, and coupled with pricing actions on top of it, that could have a pretty quick snap back in terms of profitability.
Brian Drab: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Osha from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Joseph Osha: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question. We haven't talked about Chilicon much today. I'm wondering if you think about that launch and all of the things we've been talking about here in terms of the availability of components in price, how that's working right now?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, it's great point, Joe and I'm glad you asked the question. Because we haven't talked a lot about Chilicon and it probably, out of all the acquisitions we've done and Ecobee represents a pretty nice sized TAM as well but the TAM available to us through Chilicon, through those micro inverters is big. And the team is making really good progress on the launch of those products in Q2 of next year. Still hanging in there with our commitment to do that. We're watching availability of components. We're working to scale the contract manufacturer that they -- that Chilicon was using and then we're adding other contract manufacturing resources.  We're going to broaden that supply chain out, so that we believe we've got enough supply to get going on that next year. But as we start to take a look to our plan for next year, we're sitting there, stepping back, and saying, "Look, there's a lot of people that have interest in these products ", and we're setting up to have a pretty healthy position on supply. We got to put all that together when we put our 2022 guidance together formally, but I would say the initial receptivity continues to be strong. Our project remains online and on target and the internal excitement here around what we can do with that product line is -- if you talk to Ross Minick (ph) and his team, he's incredibly bullish on what we're going to be able to do with that longer-term.
Joseph Osha: Excellent. Thanks. And then a follow-up on the Ecobee as you point out, there's a lot of people who tried -- not been terribly successful in that market. One of the things people talk a lot about is fully integrated homeward management. Which you guys are coming to potential way from a different -- a different spot, especially as you ramp storage and then [Indiscernible] I'm wondering, when you have Chilicon and you have storage, and you can offer that as part of a complete package. Might you also go to customers and saying, "Hey, we can put in with this technology, our complete homework management [Indiscernible], is that going to be part of what you tried to do?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Absolutely. It is interesting. I think people are just -- you hear that Generac acquired Ecobee, and somebody says, "Why get into the thermostat business". I think that's a pretty, frankly myopic view of what we are getting into. What we're getting into is the home energy ecosystem and if that -- look, HVAC represents the largest energy load in the home today. That may change in the future with electrification of our transportation, but today, it's the largest electrical load and the largest energy load in the home.  You combine that with our generation capabilities, whether it be PV Generation, or whether it's using a natural gas generator, with storage, with our load managements, with thermostatic control, water heater control. A water heater is another massive load in the home. You start looking across that spectrum, you could see very quickly, Joe, where it makes a ton of sense for us to include Ecobee thermostats or other grid edge devices with somebody who might be looking at a storage system or Solar Plus storage, because when you think about it in the context of the total amount of money they are going to spend on that system, frankly, the grid edge devices being thermostats, and water heater controllers, and load management controls, they are relatively small.  But they add a tremendous amount of value and rounding out the value proposition, not only for the home owner, but also again for the grid operator. I think that's where it gets really interesting. Is what we can do with that through our Concerto platform. So anyway, we're taking a really long view at this, but it's an exciting view of the world, in the future grid 2.0 context, that I think you've got to step back and you've got to see where the puck is going here, and that's kind of what we're doing with this acquisition.
Joseph Osha: Got it. Thank you so much.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mark Strouse: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Aaron, I wanted to go back to a comment you made at the Analyst Day where you thought that you'd be able to get backlog back to a quote unquote, "normalized level by the end of 2022". And even back then, you said there's a lot of factors that go into that. But just curious, over the past month since you made that statement, are you more optimistic, less optimistic on that ability?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. It's a great question Mark and one that we're talking about here as we put together our kind of formal guidance for 2022. I would say informally though, what our comment -- just answering your question directly about how I feel about it today versus maybe how I felt about it four or six weeks ago, when we put together the IR materials -- the IR day materials. I would say I'm less optimistic that we're going to be able to catch the full backlog next year as we exit the year. The demand has outstripped here over the last -- the most -- more recent period here as we ended Q3 and as we have come into Q4. It's just, it's odd to me. And we really had had -- October for the most part was a pretty quiet month on outages but the demand has been continuing just to be off the charts.  There's really no two way to say it. Everything from our leading indicators like ICs to our logging indicators like activations and then, obviously, the incoming orders that are outstripping our record production levels here. It's just the setup there is -- and it's clear to us as we continue to peel back the onion of why that is, that the home is a sanctuary trend, the electrification of everything, the concern about just power security, power reliability, these things are real.  These things are driving people to solutions like home standby generators and clean energy storage devices. And we're coming to a point of realization, I think that -- and it's why we made the comments about our commitments through the longer-term home standby capacity increases because we just feel like this is -- we're maybe at a tipping point here with this category, where we're just shy of, what, 6% penetration. I think, today, and it's -- the acceleration on that is phenomenal. We could be entering a period here where this is something that we think about as a -- that every home has to have. And there's a lot in between 6% and saying something that every home as to have, remember every 1% is $2.5 billion, so every 1% penetration is $2.5 billion of market.  And we're over 75% share in the space. So it's good math, right? I mean, it's a great setup, but we've got to be prepared for it. Everything from the ability to produce these products, to the ability to install and service the products. There's going to be a tremendous amount of focus -- there has been a tremendous amount of focus so far. but there needs to be a lot more focus by us going forward on all those areas, so that we're ready for this, so that we can enable this. Because the secular things that we're seeing out here causing it, we don't see changing anytime soon. So we've just got to be ready for it.
Mark Strouse: Thanks, Aaron. And then just a follow-up question on Phil 's question. Just about Ecobee. I appreciate it's kind of the near-term outlook. What do you think the longer-term margin contribution is from that business [Indiscernible] is what do you think the -- like what are -- I guess what are the clean power margins, generally speaking today?
York Ragen: Yes, so I guess when you think about Ecobee and you look at as we ramp that up and they grow, their margin profile in the out years looks very similar to our clean energy business. We've talked about how that will probably be in the -- the mid to high teens EBITDA margins from a gross margin standpoint, closer to that mid-30% range. So you know that -- we would expect Ecobee, again, in the out-years to look similar to that overall Clean Energy business in the out years. Today, Clean Energy, just thinking, storage, that is a profitable business today. We haven't quoted exactly what margin profile it is, it's profitable today, but over time, over the next call it a few years, that will also grow into that high -- mid-to-high teens EBITDA margins as well, so we've got a roadmap and a path to get there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jed Dorsheimer from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jed Dorsheimer: Hey. Thanks, guys and congrats with Ecobee. I've had the pleasure of working with Stuart and I think he will definitely be a great fit to the Generac family there.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And we're excited about it, Jed, thanks.
Jed Dorsheimer: I just -- Aaron, I guess first question, grid services. You were a bit more vocal than I've heard you in terms of some of the value proposition or unlocking the value proposition, I guess, with the installed base. And so I was wondering if you might be able to unpack that a little bit more. And so, if I look out it installed capacity that's underutilized out in the field of generators, it looks like well over 20 gigawatts of generating capacity. So now that you're going to be adding in the intelligence with Ecobee, how do you -- how do you get me if I have a 24 kilowatt generator to sign up for being able to access my generator when I don't need that through the Concerto or for example? And where are you in that process with utilities? Does that have to go through [Indiscernible] case or how do you -- how does that evolve to unlocking that 20-plus gigawatts?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jed. And grid services, you're right. We were a little bit more vocal on at this time because we continue to gain confidence based on honestly, just the sheer number of proposals in our pipeline. It changed dramatically in the 1 year that we've owned Enbala. The Concerto platform, they just did their latest release of the platform that adds additional functionality, that adds, again, the smart grid ready capability to our products. We've added here initially, the home standby generators, C&I gas generators, our PWRcell systems, even our Power Manager, the load management device, we're making all of those smart grid ready.  And as we see more proposals coming in, it gets us more and more excited about the opportunity to connect those assets through Concerto, to those smart grids these grid operators to be able to participate in these programs. I will tell you that there is still this, I don't want to say it's a missing link, but there's the connection process of the marketing process, right? Of going out to a utilities rate payers and saying, "Okay, we can walk in today. We've got this, we demonstrated it here at the Investor Day. " You guys may have remembered back in our labs here we showed our map, if you will, of the U.S., and where we can zoom in on all of the assets we have on the ground.  These distributed energy resources, be they generators, be they Storage Systems, or load management devices. And now going forward, be they Ecobee products, like thermostats and sensors, we're going to put all of that into the map. But we can go to a local utility, and we can have a conversation with them that's much more than just, hey, tell us about your needs. We can go in there and we can say, hey, did you know that you have this many, hundreds of megawatts available to you in your market. That could be connected -- it's on-the-ground today. These assets are there. That's just -- it's stunning.  The amount of information that provides to these utilities, --they had no idea. They have no idea that this exists today. It's not something they have to do in the future, it's something they have today. The next question is, okay, how do we connect it? How do we reach those consumers that own those assets and enroll them into the platform and then get them on these programs. If each utility is a little different as you know, some utilities move a little faster than others.  Today, we're in pilot on a number of programs with some utilities around taking existing generator owners, or existing PWRcell owners or new PWRcell owners, and marketing to them the opportunity to enroll that asset, if they've already got it installed, great; if they don't, they can buy one, get it installed, and get it enrolled. We're going through pilot on a number of these programs, and we're already exercising control.  We're giving the utilities control over these pilot programs and they're very excited about what they think they can do and what they think it means to the way they operate their grids in the future. Look, they have their backs against the wall, right? They are being mandated to -- and we all want to do this. We want to de -carbonize our energy use, and that de - carbonization is going to come from putting more renewables on the supply side.  But with that comes more instability, right? So you talked about the change in the Grid. There's the 3 Ds, right? De - carbonization, digitization and decentralization. That's what the new grid's going to look like. The pace that we're going to get there though, creates a fourth D, creates some destabilization potentially, so some instability around these renewables that are online, that maybe are not as predictable for base load usage. What we have to do is we got to give new tools to grid operators to solve for this challenge.  A grid operator's entire day is consumed by figuring out how to keep supply and demand in balance and that's exactly what the Concerto platform does. That's why we continue to add more grid assets like Ecobee into our mix, because we think that the more assets we can deliver to these grid operators and utilities, the more value as a partner we're going to bring and certainly, more value we're going to bring to the homeowner in terms of them being able to control and optimize their energy consumption. Really exciting future around that, but it's really all about grid services down the line and that's why we talk more about it today.
Jed Dorsheimer: That's great, and great explanation. Just as my follow-up, I want to shift gears a little bit. Aaron, just ask you about Europe. It's rare that you see a setup that seems this obvious. So if you look at the -- many of the misguided policies that Europe's pursuing, and how that sets up for an opportunity to capture the lack of resilience that's going into this winter. How are you thinking about positioning the business? I mean, I know your supply constrained right now and you're trying to do what you can in Trenton. But it seems like demand could just explode out to Europe, and I'm wondering how you're thinking about that in terms of being able to capture that value?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Scenario in the world that as you said, it's kind of an obvious one in terms of just the challenges and the challenging setup. You're going in the winter months for the Europeans in the way that they're -- in some cases there are dangerous energy situation there. And our products can help. I mean, the interest level in particular, at Home Standby, which picked up. We saw that very broadly as well with Home as a Sanctuary last year, we saw interest outside the U.S. pickup, far beyond anything we had seen previously for the category.  And so -- but you're right, we are supply constrained. That's the unfortunate side of things. But we're still getting product over there. We're up dramatically and what we're delivering to Europe, it's still very small as a base. But it's growing very quickly. A storage is another area, we think that we have an opportunity there. That's probably a little bit further out as we deliver on some modifications to our existing PWRcell system, we'll have a new system coming out in 2023. And that system is probably going to be a little bit better fit for some of the European applications. But we are looking at how we might go after that market more aggressively here. Because it's going to take some time to get our distribution and our go-to-market approach under us there.  So working on that, I will point out the Off Grid acquisition that we did is all about what's going on in Europe, with storage in general on the C&I side, we're seeing a lot of opportunities there, certainly in the rental markets to provide storage for the different applications there, whether it'd be entertainment applications or construction applications or things like that where clearly the high cost, the diesel fuel and even the availability in some cases of fuel in general is causing challenges.  So we're seeing storage systems like the Off Grid systems become a lot more popular. [Indiscernible] is in the short period of time, we've owned it just the So, order book there is has been really fun to watch that grow as those products get introduced. We introduce them to our legacy channel partners there. But Europe represents a huge market opportunity. We're going to stay focused on it, but I'd love to say that we're going to be able to do something more there next year. But we got a tiger by the tail here in North America as well.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And at this time, we will limit to one question only per analyst to address others questions. Our next question will be from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
David Tarantino: Good morning. This is David Tarantino on for Jeff.
York Ragen: Hi, David.
Aaron Jagdfeld: David.
David Tarantino: Just attacking these supply chain headwinds from a different angle. Could you just provide some color on how the extended lead times to 30 weeks balances out between supply shortages and just the underlying demand strength?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, it's really more the -- I would say the underlying demand strength because we are just -- the order book has continued to be very, very strong. There's certainly some components, as I said, our ability to ramp to the theoretical capacity numbers we talked about for next year -- mid-year next year, maybe somewhat constrained by supply chain in the short-term. We still think that's probably maybe a first-half '22 story and then should abate.  But I would say we are more constrained right now just based on the inability to just go beyond what -- as we get the up the learning curve here in Trenton and as we put a second-line on in Jefferson, and then as we go into next year with the new tooling that's going to get delivered there. That's just kind of pacing of getting to those levels that we've talked about. And certainly some supply chain constraints today causing that.  But I would say it's more just demand outstripping. Even if we were able to produce at max capacity today, I fear that demand would be outstripping that, given where we're at. So I think it's more that than it is supply chain constraints.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond from Piper Sandler. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Pearce Hammond: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Specifically related to acquisitions, you've made a number of acquisitions here recently. Just curious if you're going to pause to try to digest some of these and integrate? And then, if you are looking for future acquisitions, what white space is still available within this energy technology solutions kind of mandate?
Aaron Jagdfeld: That's a great question, Pearce. We have done a lot of acquisitions this year. We've done six of them. The Ecobee acquisition was number six this year, that's a lot for us. And I don't think we started the year -- we didn't set out the year to do six. Acquisition timing -- what we've learned over the years of doing, that we've done something like 23 or 24 deals now. That -- the timing of those deals, we generally don't dictate that. They're generally dedicated by sellers or dictated by market processes, things like that. It just happened at this year, we got six that came to us, we have a really strong team here. And thankfully the acquisitions have actually been spread out nicely across our C&I business, across our residential business, across our clean energy businesses. So the teams have been able to absorb them. I think they have all been in one particular part of our business, which I think is good. In fact, some of them were international. Like the Off Grid acquisition.
York Ragen: Deep Sea.
Aaron Jagdfeld: --so the -- and Deep Sea, those acquisitions are being handled by the international teams. I don't think that we'll sit here and say, okay, let's stop and not do any more acquisitions because we need to absorb these. I think what we'll say is how do we go find the resources to do the integration needed so that we can continue to accelerate our strategy. That's what acquisition -- we use acquisitions to accelerate strategy.  Some people have this narrative out there that we're -- that acquisitions are there, we're buying revenue, we're trying to obfuscate certain things. I have no idea what that's about. Look at our strategy, look at the acquisitions we've done this year, and it's a spot on fit for everything we're doing with strategy. Wherever we think we can accelerate strategy, we're going to use acquisitions.  As far as white space is concerned, there are still some areas out there that when you look at the residential space, continue to look at heavy amperage loads in the home, I think there's some spaces there, where whether it's -- it could be in EV charging, it could be in other types of appliances that might have -- where control of those things might be important, although I will say we've taken a big step forward with Ecobee.  But on the C&I side, we still have some other areas; the Off Grid acquisition while giving us a nice head-start on energy storage for C&I is still -- it's really more aimed at the mobile applications or rental applications. So I think there's some things there that we'd like to round out, but we've made some significant progress towards this effort of building the home energy ecosystem this year and also getting going on our C&I storage.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Indiscernible] on for Jerry Revich. In terms of the cost headwinds in the fourth quarter, can you describe how much is expected to be transient versus permanent?
York Ragen: I guess if you look at the impacts of commodities --
Aaron Jagdfeld: Is kind of dependent [Indiscernible] on commodity cost.
York Ragen: When we say logistics too, there's expediting costs because when there's supply chain constraints, you're expediting more so it's not just the cost of a container. You're doing some things, maybe artificially to get it here faster. I guess -- what is your view on steel, copper, and aluminum? I guess that's one answer to your question. Logistics, as long as things are busy and demand is strong. there's going to be supply chain constraints for a while, at least it's well-documented that way. But at some point, things will normalize here with the supply chain and logistics. Then things -- costs should normalize at that point. I guess all of this is transient if you have a little bit of a longer term view. But what I will say is the impact of the costs, higher input cost is going to be transient as we roll in our pricing actions and other cost reduction initiatives. So the impact of them will be transient. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Maheep Mandloi from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Maheep Mandloi: Thanks, [Indiscernible] your questions. Just a quick one on the working capital as we look into the next two quarters. Should we expect similar working capital increase for Q4 and Q1 because of the inventory challenges here? Thanks.
York Ragen: I think there -- I highlighted 4 things that are causing elevated inventory just it's taking longer for things to get here so the transit times are extended. The supply chain constraints are -- cause -- when certain components don't arrive to the line and everything else does, you get a little bit of backup in inventory. We are ramping production so to the extent we're wrapping production, that should continue.  And we're -- we're basically -- and once we get Trenton up and running too, that's going to be increasing as well as we go into Q1 next year. So, I'd probably say relative to the ramping part of the discussion, that will continue into Q1. But I think with regards to the longer in transit times, and just supply chain constraints, I think that probably has worked its way through and hopefully should level off in the next year.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Michael, please continue.
Michael Harris: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter 2021 earnings results with you in mid-February. Thank you again and goodbye.
Operator: This concludes our conference for today. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2021 Generac Holdings Incorporated Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Harris, Vice President Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Sir, please begin.
Mike Harris: Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were incredibly strong with broad-based revenue growth of 68%. And with all-time records once again for the company this quarter for net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We're particularly proud of achieving this tremendous top line growth along with the record levels of adjusted earnings, despite the ongoing significant cost pressures, logistic challenge and various capacity constraints we faced in the quarter across the supply chain. I'd like to thank our teams for their ongoing commitment to our customers. Their dedication and tireless execution have helped us to largely overcome the incredible supply chain challenges that have become commonplace in today's post-pandemic operating environment. Second quarter revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were all ahead of our expectations. The revenue outperformance was highlighted by higher shipments of home standby generators as build rates for the quarter were ahead of our previous guidance due to strong operational execution. Demand for home standby generators remains incredibly robust due to a variety of factors, including continued traction with the Home as a Sanctuary megatrend, as well as significantly higher power outage activity over the past several quarters. Revenue from global C&I products also outperformed expectations during the quarter, both domestically and internationally, highlighted by national telecom and rental customers and growth within the European region. The revenue outperformance in these areas was partially offset by lower than expected shipments of portable generators, primarily due to supply chain constraints, which has led to lower pre-season stocking levels with our retail channel partners. Adjusted EBITDA dollars were also ahead of our previous forecast, driven mainly by the higher shipping levels, but EBITDA margin was slightly below our expectations giving the higher input costs in the quarter. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 68% to $920 million and also increased sequentially at a strong rate relative to the first quarter of 2021, which was the previous all-time record. The growth in the quarter was driven by broad-based strength across the business as both residential and C&I products grew dramatically as compared to the prior year. The growth of residential products was led by robust shipments of home standby generators, which nearly doubled over the prior year due to record production levels. Additionally, shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems experienced tremendous growth both over the prior year and sequentially as demand for clean energy solutions continues to rise alongside the rapidly expanding solar plus storage market.  Shipments of C&I products also grew significantly in the quarter as demand continue to recover, off the prior year COVID lows at an accelerated rate across a number of markets and geographies and are now solidly above 2019 levels. Adjusted EBITDA increased 77% as compared to the prior year with the corresponding margin increasing 120 basis points and adjusted EPS increasing 71%. Now discussing our second quarter results in more detail, despite strong prior year comparisons due to the emergence of the Home as a Sanctuary megatrend and elevated outage levels, home consultations or sales leads for home standby generators remain strong during the second quarter and increased approximately 50% as compared to the second quarter of 2020. Consistent with the trend seen over the past year, the strength is broad based across the U.S. with nearly all states experiencing growth again in the quarter with more than half of all states showing triple-digit growth led by Texas. Activations of home standby generators, which are a proxy for installations, also grew again at a strong rate compared to the prior year with broad-based strength across all us regions, including exceptional growth in the Northeast and South Central regions. Overall outage activity as measured on a trailing four-quarter basis continued to be much higher relative to the prior comparable period and was well above the long-term baseline average, helping to drive awareness of the home standby category. In addition, we continue to expand our distribution footprint as we ended the second quarter with more than 8,000 residential dealers, adding over 300 new dealers in the quarter, the build-out distribution remains a critical focus area. As we have added approximately 700 dealers since the start of the year and 1,300 dealers over the last 12 months, which includes the addition of a number of new dealers in California and Texas that represent nearly one-third of the increase. Early in the third quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to trend even higher relative to prior year levels, including home consultations, increasing at a strong double-digit rate. We believe the ongoing strength in the product category can be attributed to several factors, which are leading to home standby generators, becoming more mainstream as homeowners have an increasing awareness of the need for power security, as they're working, learning, shopping, entertaining, and in general, spending more time in their homes. Earlier this month, we achieved a significant milestone by starting production of home standby generators at our new manufacturing in Trenton, South Carolina. This facility will provide much needed capacity to further ramp our daily home standby build rates in an effort to reduce lead times, which remain elevated at approximately 28 weeks. With the successful start-up of Trenton combined with a number of other capacity expansion activities. We're now anticipating higher production levels relative to previous expectations. And as a result, we have moderately increased our shipment outlook for these products during the second half of 2021. In addition, we remain on track to an approximately doubling of our current build rates by the end of the second quarter of 2022, which is nearly four times greater than our previous baseline output levels at the beginning of last year. I also want to provide an update on our rapidly growing clean energy product offering. As previously mentioned, we experienced a dramatic increase in shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems during the second quarter, which was aided in part by a softer prior comparison as the overall solar market was negatively impacted by a sharp drop in installations due to the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Shipments of PWRcell systems also experienced strong growth sequentially as we gained further traction in the rapidly expanding solar plus storage market. In addition to the strong revenue growth, key performance indicators for clean energy, continue to show favorable trends. In-home and virtual consultations expanded at very strong rates as compared to the prior year and sequential trends were also encouraging. System activations which are a proxy for installations and commissioning grew at a tremendous rate during the second quarter, as compared to the prior year and also improved on a sequential basis. In addition, we further built out our installer network during the quarter, and we ended the first half of the year with approximately 2,200 trained and certified dealers with nearly 900 of those dealers registered on our PowerPlay CE selling system. As we indicated on the previous quarter’s earnings call, demand for clean energy products has been outpacing supply, which is limiting our growth rates for the category. Throughout the second quarter, strong end market dynamics around energy storage coupled with our marketing and distribution initiatives resulted in further strengthening of demand for clean energy products. In addition, our teams made important progress during the quarter with our supply chain execution regarding PWRcell energy storage components. As a result, we're increasing our full year revenue outlook and now expect clean energy shipments to approximately double as compared to the prior year. In addition, we're driving profitable growth within the product category as we scale volumes and optimize the supply chain. As we've also discussed on recent calls, we have an exciting pipeline of innovative clean energy products expected to come to market over the next several quarters. These launches include generator integration with our PWRcell storage systems, the ability to more efficiently add a PWRcell system to an existing solar install. The launch of a new DC output generator that can be combined with solar and storage, to allow an end-user to operate independently of the power grid and a new load management system that will be paired with our existing power view energy monitoring platform to allow a homeowner to more fully control their power generation and consumption. In addition, we're making our PWRcell system’s smart grid ready, which will enable them to be used in virtual power plant applications using Enbala's Concerto software platform. We believe these product launches will further enhance our competitive position and differentiation in the energy storage, monitoring and management markets. As we look to further build out our clean energy offerings into a complete ecosystem of products and solutions for installers and end-users. Consistent with this approach, in early July, we entered the large and growing microinverter market for solar applications with the acquisition of Chilicon Power. Based in Los Angeles, California, Chilicon is a designer and provider of grid interactive microinverter and monitoring solutions for the solar market. We call that the solar plus storage attachment rates are currently between 20% and 25%, which essentially means we weren't participating in 75% to 80% of the market that was focused on solar-only installations. This strategic acquisition will dramatically increase our serve market and help us deepen our relationships with solar channel partners and installers, as we expand our clean energy product suite to include microinverters. Industry sources estimate the global market for microinverters and optimizers used in residential applications to be approximately $2.5 billion for 2020 and is projected to grow to approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2023. We have a proven track record of developing leading energy solutions. And we intend to apply the same playbook that we have previously used for other acquisitions in this space with a focus on scaling the business through our innovative lead generation capabilities, our omnichannel distribution approach, the implementation of a variety of cost out actions and by leveraging Generac's extensive supply chain expertise. I'd also like to provide a brief update on Enbala Power Networks, a leading grid services technology provider that we acquired last fall. We are making good progress with the deep integration of Enbala’s Concerto software platform with our existing products. And today, we now have this smart grid ready functionality available for all of our C&I natural gas generators, home standby generators and our PWRcell energy storage systems. Also over the last several quarters, Enbala has been working closely with Generac's commercial sales teams on potential projects with utilities, cooperatives, and energy aggregators, which has led to a considerable increase in quoting and proposal activities for the business so far in 2021. As the market for grid services continues to develop, we believe combining our equipment hardware with Enbala software is a critical first step by making Generac's products smart grid ready, thereby allowing them to operate as distributed energy resources known as DERs. These DERs can be aggregated into a virtual power plant or VPP solution and bundled with turnkey services that should enable us to improve our value proposition to end users, utilities and grid operators allowing us to develop various new revenue streams in the years ahead. These will not only include the existing Software-as-a-Service platform that Enbala currently offers but could also include a variety of vertical operational services that enable a more turnkey solution and ultimately even performance services that could deliver megawatts of power to various potential customers. The recent heat waves experienced in the U.S. this summer are an important example of the growing need for utilities and grid operators to expand their use of grid services and DER assets. At one point late June, Enbala enabled the deployment of hundreds of megawatts of its connected fleet to maintain grid stability predominantly in the Pacific Northwest and Northeast in response to the extreme temperatures that created enormous demand spikes for power in those regions. In these instances, the combination of grid services, software and systems along with DER assets were used for flexibility response purposes to supplement traditional power plants. We believe systems such as Enbala’s Concerto platform and DER assets like those provided by Generac will become critically important going forward for utilities and grid operators who will be tasked with providing stability and resiliency across their networks as more renewable power, which is highly variable is brought online and as end-users dramatically increased their consumption with the electrification of everything from heating and cooling to transportation over the next decade. In addition to the great performance of our residential products in the second quarter, our C&I products also had a tremendous quarter, as demand across a number of markets and geographies continued to recover at a faster pace than we have previously expected. Net sales of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel grew again in the quarter at a solid rate with quoting project activity and order volumes further recovering from the pandemic related lows of last year with growth well ahead of 2019 levels. And we expect attractive growth for this channel for the full year. We're also experiencing encouraging growth with the energy systems business, our industrial distributor in Northern California that we acquired last year. As our investments integration activities and overall increased focus are producing excellent results in this large and rapidly growing power generation market. Shipments to telecom national account customers increased significantly during the quarter as compared to the prior year. And we're well ahead of our expectations as capital spending by several of our larger telecom customers accelerated and led to a further increase in projected shipments during the current year. The catalyst for the additional spending on backup power in this important vertical continues to be driven by an elevated power outage environment over the last several years. The power security mandate in California requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all tower locations and the build-out of wireless carriers 5G networks. The long-term demand outlook for telecom backup power remains very compelling driven by the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications, as this infrastructure shifts to the next generation architecture.  Shipments of mobile products to national rental account customers were also hired during the second quarter as compared to the very soft prior year, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. We still expect shipments of mobile products for full year 2021 to improve dramatically from prior year levels. As national rental account customers significantly increased their spending on fleet equipment with utilization and rental rates continuing to improve. Longer term, we remain optimistic about demand for mobile products, with the compelling megatrend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could finally benefit from economic stimulus plans being pursued by the current administration. Additionally, we continue to gain important traction with our lead gas initiatives through increased quoting activity and improved project close rates for our natural gas generators used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, such as they're using microgrids or other distributed generation applications. Quoting activity and the sales pipeline is growing significantly for these project opportunities and revenue for these applications increased at a substantial rate during the second quarter, as compared to the prior year. And the outlook has further increased for full year 2021. This is an emerging part of our C&I business that had good momentum entering the year and with the major winter related outages in Texas, and the extreme heat waves occurring this summer, we're seeing increased interest and demand for these solutions. To support the growing opportunities we see in our C&I business. We announced the closing of Deep Sea Electronics on June 1. The advanced controls designer and manufacturer headquartered in the United Kingdom. We believe Deep Sea’s high level of technical expertise and the added engineering bandwidth, their team will give us will be critical to helping us develop and accelerate our product roadmap for the future, bolstering our electronics and controls capabilities and supporting further innovation to meet dynamic needs of the evolving energy technology solutions market. As we advance the use of our products and applications beyond standby power, the need for complex systems levels controls for distributed generation, storage and other DER assets used in microgrid applications will serve as a key enabler of the decentralization of the power grid in the future. Similar to our domestic C&I products, demand internationally has also rebounded strongly in recent quarters with shipments increasing at a core rate of 45% in the second quarter, compared to the prior year. This growth was primarily due to strengthen the European and Latin American regions, which experienced a sharp increase in demand as end markets recovered off the pandemic induced prior year lows. While some COVID-19 impacts and restrictions are still lingering in several international regions, larger project quoting and overall order activity continued to recover at a faster than expected pace. This is leading to growth in our international backlog at the end of the second quarter with the order strength continuing early on here in the third quarter. Stronger organic growth combined with the Deep Sea acquisition are both driving our revenue outlook for the international segment higher than previously expected for the full year. In addition, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to expand considerably in the second half of the year, primarily benefiting from the impact of the inclusion of Deep Sea’s results, as well as from improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes. In closing this morning, we believe our recent strategic acquisitions are important examples of our ability to leverage our strong financial position to further expand our capabilities and advance our strategy as we continue our transition into an energy technology solutions company. We remain focused on developing innovative solutions that enable, protect and improve the efficiency of next generation, power, communications, transportation, and other critical infrastructure and going forward, we intend to continue investing aggressively in a number of strategic initiatives, both organically and through acquisitions that we believe can help to accelerate these efforts. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our second quarter results and our updated outlook for 2020. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at second quarter of 2021 results in more detail. Net sales increased 68% to $920 million during the second quarter of 2021, an all time record as compared to $546.8 million in the prior year second quarter. The combination of the Energy Systems, Mean Green, Enbala and Deep Sea acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 4% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidate net sales for the second quarter by product class. Residential products sales increased 76% to $600 million as compared to $341.4 million in the prior year. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience robust growth, which nearly doubled during the second quarter, as shipments benefited from much higher production levels for these products as compared to the prior year. Shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems also grew at a dramatic rate as compared to the prior year as the solar plus storage market in the U.S. continues to rapidly expand and as we build out our marketing and distribution capabilities are selling into the clean energy space. Portable generators also increased at a solid rate versus prior year due to the higher power outages severity in recent quarters and shipments of chore products also improved at a strong rate in part due to the electrification of our product lines. Commercial and industrial product net sales for the second quarter of 2021 increased 64% to $254.3 million, as compared to $154.9 million in the prior year quarter. There was an approximate 7% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the Deep Sea acquisition and favorable foreign currency. The very strong core revenue growth was in part aided by the softer prior year comparison, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, C&I revenue also grew 6% on a core basis as compared to 2019 levels. The strength in shipments compared to prior year was due to broad-based growth across a number of markets and geographies as demand is recovering at an accelerated rate, both domestically and internationally in the following areas. Domestically, the growth was due to a substantial increase in shipments to telecom national account customers, resulting from much higher capital spending as they continue to harden their wireless networks. Shipments of mobile products recovered significantly compared to the soft prior comparison, as our rental account customers accelerated their fleet replacement, given higher utilization and rental rates, also contributing to the increase with solid growth with our industrial distributors, as well as an increase in other project opportunities as we gain traction with our lead gas initiatives. Internationally, the increase in C&I products as previously mentioned was primarily due to an increase in market activity, mostly in the European and Latin American regions that are recovering sharply from the impacts of the pandemic that existed during the prior year. Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring and grid services subscription revenue and other service offerings increased 30% to $65.7 million as compared to $50.6 million in the second quarter of 2020. There was an approximate 9% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the energy systems at Enbala acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. In addition, we experienced very strong growth in aftermarket service parts as a result of the higher power outage activity in recent quarters. A larger and growing installed base of our products and additional extended warranty revenue also contributed to the increase versus prior year. Gross profit margin was 36.9% as compared to 38.2% in the prior year second quarter, which was impacted by higher input costs in the current year that were partially offset by improved pricing and more favorable overhead absorption from the higher sales volumes. Operating expenses increased $37.4 million or 31.3% as compared to the second quarter of 2020, but declined 460 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization due to the strong operating leverage on substantially higher sales volumes in the current year quarter. As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interest as defined in our earnings release was an all time record of $217.7 million or 23.7% of net sales as compared to $123.1 million or 22.5% of net sales in the prior year. This 120 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin was primarily the result of the improved leverage or the fixed operating expenses on the much higher sales volumes being partially offset by the aforementioned declining gross margin. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segments sales increased 70% to $784.1 million as compared to $460.8 million in the prior year quarter, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $203.9 million or 26% of net sales, as compared to $121.3 million in the prior year or 26.3% of net sales. International segment sales increased 57.8% to $135.8 million, as compared to $86.1 million in the prior year quarter, with the impact of acquisitions in foreign currency contributing approximately 13% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Going forward, the financial results for Deep Sea Electronics will be included in our international segment primarily within C&I product class. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interest was $13.7 million or 10.1% of net sales, as compared to $1.9 million or 2.2% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in international segment margin was primarily due to improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and the impact of the Deep Sea acquisition. Now switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2021 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $127 million, as compared to $66.1 million for the second quarter of 2020. GAAP income taxes during the current year second quarter was $46.4 million or an effective tax rate of 26.6% as compared to $18.5 million or an effective tax rate of 22.5% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a discreet tax item, resulting from a legislative tax rate change in the United Kingdom, which revalued deferred tax liabilities by $7 million or approximately 4% tax rate impact during the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.01 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.02 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company as defined in our orange release was $153.2 million in the current year quarter or $2.39 per share, which was also an all-time record, this comparison with adjusted net income of $88.5 million in the prior year or $1.40 per share. Cash income taxes for the second quarter of 2021 were $37.4 million as compared to $13.9 million in the prior year quarter. The current year reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 21% to 21.5% for the full year 2021, which is higher than the previously expected rate of approximately 20.5% 2021, primarily the result of higher intangible amortization from the Deep Sea acquisition, which is not deductible for tax purposes. Also the 21% to 21.5% cash tax rate compares to the prior year rate of 17% that was anticipated in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus prior year is primarily due to a significant increase in domestic pre-tax income, which is taxed at a higher statutory rate. Cash flow from operations was once again robust at $122.5 million as compared to $101.8 million in the prior year second quarter. And free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was $96.3 million as compared to $89 million in the same quarter last year. Both operating and free cash flow represented records for the second quarter of a year. The increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher operating earnings in the current year quarter, which was partially offset by a higher level of income taxes paid and capital expenditures in the current year, which included the new facility in Trenton, South Carolina. Before discussing our updated outlook for 2021, I want to comment briefly on our strong liquidity position at the end of the second quarter of 2021. In May, we amended our ABL facility, increasing its size from $300 million to $500 million and extending the maturity dates from June, 2023 to May, 2026, along with reducing the LIBOR spread to 100 basis points to 125 basis points, depending on availability under the revolver. As of June 30, 2021, we had $830 million of liquidity comprised of $390 million of cash on hand and $440 million of availability on the ABL revolver. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the second quarter was $871 million net of unamortized original issue discount in deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of second quarter was only 1.1 times on an as reported basis. Further enhancing this attractive capital structure is our strong cash flow profile with free cash flow over the last 12 months at $561 million, which allows us to confidently operate our business, accelerate our strategy and further enhance shareholder value. I would now like to provide some additional details on our increased outlook for full year 2021. As Aaron highlighted earlier, there are several areas of the business where we are performing better than expected. And as a result, we are raising our full year revenue outlook for 2021. In particular, the company continues to make better than expected progress in increasing production rates for home standby generators. And as a result, we are moderately increasing our shipment outlook for these products for full year 2021. In addition, we're experiencing stronger than expected demand for our PWRcell energy storage systems and combined with additional supply chain execution and the closing of the recent Chilicon acquisition, we're also increasing our shipment outlook for clean energy products as well. The outlook for C&I products has also improved due to a further broad-based rebound in demand, highlighted by a continued pickup and activity from telecom national account customers, overall stronger demand from international markets and the closing of the Deep Sea acquisition. As a result of these factors, we are increasing our full year 2021 net sales guidance to now be approximately 47% to 50% growth compared to the prior year, which includes approximately 3% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This is an increase from our previous as reported guidance of 40% to 45% growth with the majority of the improvement being organic growth. Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outages for the remainder of the year in line with the long-term baseline average, consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of another major power outage event in the second half of the year. Looking at seasonality for the second half of the year, revenue is expected to increase sequentially in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter with an even higher sequential improvement anticipated for the fourth quarter, as we further scale home standby production and clean energy shipments. Updating our margin outlook for the full year 2021, we continue to experience higher input costs relative to our previous guidance due to rising commodities and significantly higher logistics costs. To address these higher input costs, we implemented additional pricing actions during the second quarter across our product lines and we continue to focus on cost reduction initiatives through our profitability enhancement program. However, given our current backlog situation, we did not expect to realize these margin enhancements until the fourth quarter and into 2022. As a result of these factors, we now expect gross margins for full year 2021 to be approximately flat as compared to the prior year, which compares to the previous expectation of an approximate 50 basis point increase. Adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interest are now expected to be approximately 24.5% to 25% as compared to the previous guidance range of 24.5% and a half to 25.5%, and up from the 23.5% margin in the prior year. From a seasonality perspective, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins during the third quarter to be slightly lower relative to the second quarter, primarily due to the start-up of the Trenton, South Carolina facility and higher operating expense investments. However, adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter, returning closer to the first quarter levels as a result of pricing realization, improved sales mix, favorable overhead absorption and other margin enhancement initiatives. Several additional guidance items that we provide to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow also require updating for 2021. As mentioned previously, our cash income tax rate is now expected to be approximately 21% to 21.5% for the full year 2021, which is higher than the previously expected rate of approximately 20.5% for 2021. Interest expense is not expected to be approximately $32 million assuming no additional principal payments and flat LIBOR rates for the remainder of the year. This compares to the previous guidance of approximately $34 million with the decline primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate for the year. Our capital expenditures for 2021, as a percentage of forecasted net sales are now projected to be at the higher end of the previous guidance range of between 2.5% to 3% due to additional capacity expansion actions. GAAP intangible amortization expense for 2021 is now forecasted to be approximately $49 million to $50 million, as compared to the previous guidance of approximately $34 million to $35 million, which is due to the closing of the Deep Sea and Chilicon acquisitions and the related preliminary purchase price allocations. Stock compensation expense is now expected to be approximately $24 million, which is at the high end of the previous guidance range of between $20 million to 24 million, also due to the recent acquisitions. Finally, the following remaining miscellaneous guidance names remain unchanged. Our GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 22.5% to 23.5% for the full year. Depreciation expense is still forecasted to be approximately $40 million in 2021, given our assumed capital spending guidance. Operating and free cash flow generation for the full year 2021 is expected to remain strong with the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow still anticipated to be approximately 90%. And our full year diluted share count is still expected to be approximately 64 million to 64.5 million shares. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is open
Mike Halloran: Everyone, thanks for taking the question. So I just want to clarify the comments that were just made by York there. If I heard you right based on the timing of the capacity additions coming in, you should see acceleration in basically throughput through the facilities 3Q into 4Q. Concurrently you should see some margin normalization as the right pricing comes through, as you get a little more normalization. So is the implication there for that the jumping off point into 2022, it should be at a higher run rate relative to what you're seeing today is all of those things start normalizing out for you, or am I thinking about that wrong?
York Ragen: Yes. Mike, this is York. So I think, like I said in my comments, we do expect Q4 margins to return closer to Q1 levels, as Q2, Q3, we see the transitory impact of our higher input costs. So I guess to that end, Q4 looking similar to Q1, I guess that's the jumping off point into 2022, obviously need to roll up our 2022 budgets to figure out, what that looks like next year. But we feel good and confident that margins will at least get back to where they were in Q1 by Q4.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comments comes from the line of Tommy Moll from Stephens. Your line is open.
Tommy Moll: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning.
Tommy Moll: Good to hear you've now cut the ribbon in Trenton and are on track to hit the run rate thereby, I think you said Q2 of next year, which would reflect a doubling of capacity. So could you walk us through the operational goals you have to get from here to there? And then when you get there next year, just doing the rough math would be – would we be wrong to think about your residential revenue potential is just a doubling of the $600 million that you just put up or is that not the right way to think about it? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Tommy; this is Aaron. The doubling is the max capacity that we would have in total for the home standby products by Q2 of next year, the doubling that we referred to, the doubling of where we're at today, once everything in Trenton is online. And again, we – what we're trying to do is, build some surge capacity into the system, we've lost that over the last couple of years as the market's growth in home standby has outstripped our pacing of output. So we're hoping to build some additional surge capacity, because that business needs that – they're just – the periods of growth are hallmarked by outage events and other types of things that happen in the external markets, and you have to react to that. And again, we've lost a little bit of – we've lost the ability to get some upside as a result of where we're at today. So that's what we're building out. In terms of operational kind of milestones or things that we're focused on here over the next call it nine months as we bring that facility fully online. Right now, we're in the initial startup phase, we actually were fortunate to get in there right at the beginning of the month, which was amazing, that’s four and a half months from when we took occupancy of the facility. So what our team has done there I'm incredibly proud of, they've worked very, very hard to bring that facility up. We've got about 300 and some employees in the facility today, we've just brought on a second shift. And so, what we're pacing to, is to have about 800 employees in that facility by the end of the year. And that won't get us to the doubling that we're talking about here. What gets us even further is the addition of some further manufacturing, tooling and automation equipment that we'll be adding into the facilities in Q1 and Q2. And so, the addition of that equipment, those additional pieces of equipment is really what takes us to the full potential run rate of that facility by Q2 of next year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ross Gilardi: Yes. Hi guys; good morning.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning.
Ross Gilardi: Just further on that question. I just wanted to verify, when you quote the backlog and weeks, I think you said it was still 28 weeks, which is similar to what you said last quarter. Is that apples-to-apples on the denominator? In other words, when you quoted the 28 weeks last quarter, was that based on the capacity pre-Trenton, and now you're basing on the capacity with the addition – with Trenton, or how do we think about that? What is the 28 weeks actually based on? We've written in our notes that we think the backlog is closer to $1 billion in dollar terms, and just trying to get a sense if that is still directionally in the right ballpark.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Ross, the way to think about that is, the quoted lead time would be the lead time today, right. So when we gave that update on the last earnings call, we were quoting it based off of what our expected production rate was going to be in the future. And that's how that's – and based on order volume and the quantum of the backlog, you noted there in your question. That all goes into calculating the backlog. So when we're giving that update again this quarter, and the fact that it hasn't changed, but yet we have higher production levels in the future. We've also, as we indicated in the prepared remarks, we've been experiencing higher incoming order rates. So, that kind of matches up with the higher expected production at this stage. Now, what remains to be seen as we've said throughout is kind of how the season plays out. In terms of hurricanes, in terms of power safety shutoffs around, potential for wildfires out West and in other parts of the country, our guidance doesn't contemplate any of that in there. Now we're not guiding lead times, but what would happen mathematically is, as the order rate – as the output, – excuse me, as the production rate kind of outstrips your rate over time, the lead times would come in. We're still expecting a considerable backlog at this point by the end of the year. I don't know what that exactly will translate to in terms of lead time, because we need to understand what the order rate is at that point and also where we're at on the output levels and how we're thinking about our ability to hit that doubling that we've talked about by Q2. So it's a – there is a lot of math that goes into it. And then there is a bit of a forecast as well, obviously on where we think things are going. But at this stage, it's – the demand has been incredibly robust, we've said this in the prepared remarks as well, we’re here early in the third quarter in July. Our IHCs are home consultation sales leads for home standby are up again on very difficult comps compared to last year. So, I mean, it's just – it continues to amaze us the interest level in the category and how that's translating into real demand. So we're encouraged that that's very supportive of where we're going with the category in terms of our expanded capacity. We think we're going to be in good shape for that. And then again, as I said, we'll let the season play out here to see how kind of things shape up as we exit 2021 and go into 2022.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Philip Shen from ROTH Capital. Your line is open.
Philip Shen: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. To what degree are you guys considering yet another round of capacity expansion, Q2 2022 is – it's not right around the corner, but you have such visibility into the business now that arguably at some level maybe that's not enough. Do you think beyond Trenton, there is either more expansion there or maybe some more in Wisconsin or in yet another location altogether?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It’s a good question, Phil. And one obviously we watch – we're watching very closely, mainly on the context that we were – we've been unable – largely unable to get ahead of demand with our output, and that's why we've gone very heavy here with the Trenton investment. And essentially what's going to amount to a quadrupling of our output, potentially a quadrupling of our output by Q2 of next year versus where we kind of came into the year last year as a baseline, if you want to use that as a baseline. In terms of like adding additional capacity, I think a lot of that for us is going to come down to what kind of a season plays out this fall. I think we feel pretty good about – and remember capacity is not just about getting a building and equipment and hiring people, it's about the supply chain to support that. So today, we're actually – and this is a process we've gone through pretty rigorously over the last several years, as we're constantly sizing the supply chain to be greater than our ability to produce. So we're oversizing the supply chain, because it takes longer to get your supply chain to grow. It's a longer – a lot of times you're looking for secondary or even tertiary sources, you have to qualify – if not only find those source, you have to qualify them and get them ramped. And that generally takes longer, as I said, it took us four and a half months to get into – get the building, get in there and get it ready to run and get it producing product. And, while it's not producing at the top rate that we expected to at this point, we’re there, it's kind of – the startups getting behind us here and we're growing, but really the supply chain. So we're sizing the supply chain actually larger than that point in Q2 of next year. And so, if we see a really strong season this fall and surges in demand off of that, we could react, we do have some room to expand in Trenton that facility that the area there that we acquired is expandable to about 2.5 times its size, if we chose to do that. We'd have to analyze whether or not that made sense, or if maybe more of the growth is out west, it really kind of depends, it might make more sense to have a facility located closer to wherever we see the demand growth. So we're going to watch it very closely. We're going to react very quickly. And I think we're going to be in pretty good shape, given the expansion in our own capacity by Q2, and then also the supply chain expansion that we've been working on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is open
Brian Drab: Good morning. I’m just – we’re going to ask a question about the Chilicon acquisition. And can you comment on what sort of demand were you seeing from channel partners for you to carry the product line that Chilicon enables? And is there a potential to see step function increase in the shipments and revenue for the PWRcell business in general, just by opening up new channel relationships? And then do you have the capacity at Chilicon to serve all of it? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Let me try to unpack some of that Brian, because a really good question. Chilicon is a – we're very excited about this acquisition. It's a small company, basically a startup today, really like the technology, really like what they've done with the product line in its early stages. We've got work to do to scale it, of course. Today it's contract manufacturer here in the U.S., we think that we can – again, as we stated in our prepared remarks, we kind of put a playbook together here for our approach to this, with what we did with Pika. Recall that, Pika was also a startup pretty nascent the demand was – it was a very small company, and here we’re turning it into just an amazing growth engine for us going forward. We think Chilicon is going to be all of that. I mean, the reason we went after this, we love storage and we think storage fits really, really well with our approach to the market from a resiliency standpoint in particular. But remember, you're only talking about attachment rates to new solar of 20% to 25%. So, in effect, as we try and develop channel partners, and as we try and develop our brand in this market, we're not participating in 75% to 80% of what goes on in the market on the solar only side. So the acquisition of Chilicon is really a way for us to continue to build out, what we're referring to it internally as a supermarket. I think in our prepared remarks, we said an ecosystem of products with this suite of products, but this is truly a supermarket approach. We want to have a really broad product offering here from the microinverters themselves all the way through to the storage pieces to our power generation assets that have been also well received by the solar channel – the channel partners there. So in terms of step function change to answer your question directly, more to come on that, we've got an Investor Day here at the end of the September, we are going to be debuting these products at the Solar Power International show down in New Orleans in mid-September. Our first kind of area of focus here is to take the existing Chilicon product. And in order to scale it, there is some things we have to do to it, there is some design for manufacturability, considerations alongside the development of the supply chain. We really intend to launch kind of a branded Generac portion of Generac Solution, if you will of the kind of existing Chilicon technology, sometime in really early Q2 of next year. And I think that's when you would see, and we would expect to see some inflection. Much the same, again, it's like Pika, it took us a good six months by the end of the year. We bought that – we bought Pika, I think it was in April or May of 2019. And it took us till really the beginning of 2020 before we were in the market with a Generac branded solution there. Kind of a similar again, similar playbook and a similar approach here. But I think that the result, I mean, look, the served market that we've basically acquired here. I mean, it's massive. I mean, it's a huge market that's dominated by two players. And everybody, at least in the U.S. and every particular channel partner that we've talked to in the solar side has told us that there's room for more competition. We're excited to hear that. We think that competition should have a Generac brand on it. We think we're going to be able to use a lot of the things that we've done to be successful in the short time we've been involved in this market with Pika and Neurio, we think we're going to be able to replicate that success very quickly with Chilicon so pretty exciting stuff ahead.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Joseph Osha from Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Joseph Osha: Good morning, guys. Just wondering if we can return to PWRcell a little bit, you've given us some comments about this year, but I'm wondering as we sort of exit the year into 2022, if you can talk a little bit about the run rate you hope to achieve. Thanks.
York Ragen: Yes. No, I think as we said in our prepared remarks, we upped our guidance to basically we're looking to double that business here in 2021 relative to 2020. So I think we've publicly said, we did about $115 million of sales last year, looking to double that here in 2021. And sequentially, that's going to ramp from Q2 to Q3 and then again, into Q4 so that, we're looking to successively ramp our output of those products over the quarters here and really in the next year, that's the expectation the market's there, the demands there. We've said publicly that the demand is outstripping our supply and that's what we're working on right now to ramp up in 2022.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And Joe, I would just add to that we look at other people in this, they're serving this market and there's some fairly high profile players that are – they're constraint on supply as well. And maybe even – I would say maybe even more so than where we're at. I mean, we – just in the second quarter, our growth in the category York was 500% over the prior year. So, I mean, that is a – we're ripping higher with that product category. And we're looking for big things as we exit this year and going into 2022. I think, again, you combine that and my previous remarks around Chilicon and you put that all together. I think we're incredibly bullish about the future with clean energy, it's in terms of not only the size of the TAM and the speed at which it's growing, but when you think about storage, the speed at which attachments growing as well, I mean, their forecast for solar alone to grow 40%, 50% next year. Attachment rates are going to grow, maybe 30% next year from the 20 to 25 they're at this year, you put all that together. And for us, it's – as York said, demand is outstripping supply. So we're really scrambling to add additional supply so that we can satisfy that increase that is coming at us here. So a lot of effort being put on that internally and with our supply chain. And I feel like what we're building there is something that's going to be really exciting in the future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mark Strouse from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Mark Strouse: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. York, I just wanted to go back to the guidance, please. So understand the EBITDA dollar outlook is increasing, the margin goes down just a tad though. I'm wondering if you could break down that between input costs versus just mix. It sounds to me like C&I might be a bit stronger than you were expecting. And then just quick follow-up, sorry, just to – not to steal your thunder from the analyst day, but do you do you intend to update your long-term targets relatively soon?
York Ragen: Yes. To your point, we're looking to schedule an analyst day at the end of September and that's when we would be updating our long-term targets. So appreciate the ability to get that out there. Relative – that the EBITDA margin bridge versus previous guidance you're right. It only takes down at the mid of the range. It's only about a 25 basis points moderation there. And there are some moving points inside there. So you're right about the cost bucket, the higher input costs probably did have a lot of 1% impact on that guidance change, but we were able to given the volume leverage on the higher sales volume as you're talking about, that's probably bought back about 50 basis points of that 1%. And then from an M&A and mix standpoint, maybe there's another 25 basis points that you're clawing back. So those were good guys offsetting the input cost, bad guy. And so net-net, we just believe that there's going to be some moderation once you get through the reality of steel costs have really gone up a lot since our last call, our last guidance. And so has logistics costs, just the cost of 40-foot containers are up, four times, in that window here. So just battling through that and the good news is we've got some price increases out there and when we start realizing those in Q4, we start ramping up and absorbing Trenton, South Carolina more and just the better mix when you ship more home standby, coupled with some other costs reduction efforts we're working on. That's why we just, we feel confident that, we're going to be able to bring our gross margins back up in Q4.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning. 
Christopher Glynn: So I think in the cash flow statement showed 419 million acquisitions. Wanted to unpack that a little bit, I don't know if the funding of Chilicon put forward into the second quarter, despite the early July close and I don't know if they're ready earnouts and any prior deals, but I just want to kind of unpack that. And maybe I think you give commentary on Deep Sea being or one of them being sort of startup wondering if the other one has more run rate business entering Generac.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, so the cash flow statement predominantly, all of that was in fact Deep Sea, Chilicon did close in July, so that's a Q3 event. But Deep Sea, you're, right. That's an established business that's been around for a real long time, well-known in the power generation industry in terms of advanced controls and global business. We've talked about how it looks a little bit like, acquisitions we've done in the past with that we're in that $50 million to $100 million range of established business. What was very different about Deep Sea though, is that their margin profile is much higher than what we've acquired in the past. In fact, it's, it's actually much higher than our corporate average here of 24.5% to 25%. So that acquisition actually will be accretive from a margin standpoint. And we really like what that business is going to do for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond: Hey guys. Just two final point questions. One, if you can quantify the startup costs, you're heading to 2Q and what do you think that's going to be into the second half? And then just you mentioned the portable, kind of being held back by supply chain. I was just wondering what unique about the portable dynamic that held that back. Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, I think the startup question, I think is specifically around the Trenton facility, there was some small startup costs in Q2 where there are going to be, a rough, a more site startup costs in Q3, which again is part of the weighing down of margins here in Q3. But it's not huge, if it's a few million, 5 million, that that would be a lot, but there will be some startup costs in Q3, more so than there were in Q2.
York Ragen: And then Jeff on the portables, the comment there. So interestingly enough, there's kind of a little bit of a something going on there in the portable industry. Many of the large customers are requesting or even mandating carbon monoxide shutoff technology be put on all portable generators. So large DIY retail chains have done that, which has created a bit of a challenge around – the technology itself is as you can imagine with a semiconductor limited supply, there's more technology there onboard a portable generator than would traditionally have been involved. So that created a problem with the supply chain. We're working through it effectively what's going to happen is, we weren't able to fill a channel to the level that the channel wanted nor that we wanted here in Q2, when we would normally do that ahead of the season. So, we do have a lot of those products hopefully coming at us here in the third quarter. And I think the idea would be, there may be more opportunity, if the season plays out, there could be opportunity to not only satisfy that increase in demand, but also the channel restock on top of that. So it could be a bit of a double hit if the season plays out strongly, we'll have to see how that works. Again, our guidance doesn't contemplate that at this point, because we don't have any major outage events in our guide, but it's really kind of a unique thing with those product lines.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of J.B. Lowe from Citi. Your line is open.
J.B. Lowe: Hey good morning, Aaron, York and Mike. Just want to follow up on the cost aspect of the guide. What does the – what is the new margin guide contemplate in terms of, what the costs will do from here, both on commodities and logistics? And then I guess on the pricing increases, is any of that net pricing or is it all just gross pass-through?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So yes, in terms of like our assumption on steel, copper, aluminum, we effectively assume that it flat lines from where we're at today. And same with logistics costs maybe go up a little bit more because we're seeing that currently as we're bringing product in the door, what was the second question? I'm sorry. I missed the second question. It was – yes. We can circle back with JB on that one.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Pearce Hammond from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Pearce Hammond: Good morning. I'm just curious how you see the relationship between the PWRcell product and home standby generators. Do they compete with one another or are they complimentary, just want to understand how the growth in that PWRcell business could impact home standby generators? Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, that's a great question, Pearce. At this stage of the game, they're actually very complimentary. What we're finding is that the person who buys a home standby generator is worried about long duration outages. So multi-day events that the kind that you typically see during a hurricane or an ice storm, or what you saw in Texas over that winter event or even some of the power safety shutoffs that have been multiple days in length as much as we love the storage category today, the technology from a performance and cost standpoint are just not competitive with long duration outage protection that you can get from an engine driven gen set. Where storage has been largely coming in and coming on strong, it's for somebody who's really already contemplating a solar system. So they're going to be able to generate their own power on the rooftop. And they want to store that power for use at a later time, either because they can sell it advantageously back to the utility or grid operator at a point in time when rates are higher during the day and gain that arbitrage between their cost to produce versus their cost to sale. Or they want some limited outage protection. Certainly resiliency is a piece of what people are looking at in the storage market. But we would just – as we've continued to say throughout, each of those kinds of markets, the home standby market and the storage market are kind of concentric circles. And there's a bit of overlap, of course and over time as storage technology continues to improve and as the cost continues to come down, it's possible that you could use storage products for long duration outage, but it's got a long way to go before it gets to that point on a cost effective basis. So in fact, we actually see quite a few customers that who have a solar system and they have the storage device. They also want to add a generator for the long duration protection, right. So they have the short duration protection with the battery product and also the ability to arbitrage on rate, help them save some money on their power bills. But then they want to have a generator also for long duration outage protection. So we have customers that have all of the products actually. So it’s very interesting to watch how the market develops, but at least at this stage, that they seem to be very complimentary to one another.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no additional questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mike Harris for any closing remarks.
Mike Harris: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2021 earnings results with you in late October. Thank you again and goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Generac Holdings Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Michael Harris. Please go ahead.
Michael Harris: Thanks, Alicia. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release, or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were incredibly strong as net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were all-time records for Generac, despite Q1 historically being the low point for the year seasonally for our business.  First quarter revenue margins and profitability were all significantly ahead of our previous expectations. The revenue outperformance was very broad-based and was highlighted by increased shipments of residential products, primarily due to home standby and portable generators. Home standby build rates were ahead of plan for the quarter, and demand further accelerated due to continuing traction with the Home as a Sanctuary megatrend, as well as being driven by significantly higher power outage activity in recent quarters, including the major event in Texas, which also led to a sharp increase in demand for portable generators. Revenue from C&I products also outperformed expectations during the quarter domestically with our industrial distributors, national telecom customers and rental customers, as well as internationally, mostly in the European region. Also, in terms of profitability, adjusted EBITDA margin came in considerably higher than our previous forecast, driven mostly by greater operating leverage from the significantly higher revenue achieved during the quarter. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased 70% to $807 million and also increased sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2020, which was our previous all-time record. Growth in the quarter was broad-based, led by a dramatic increase for residential products that more than doubled compared to prior year as shipments for home standby generators were much higher due to record production levels. Shipments of portable generators also increased driven by the major outage event in Texas and higher outage activity overall in recent quarters. Deliveries of chore products and clean energy products, such as our PWRcell energy storage system, also grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year, and shipments of C&I products returned to strong growth in the quarter. Gross margin expanded 370 basis points compared to prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 840 basis points over the prior first quarter to 26.5%, which was the highest EBITDA margin reported since the fourth quarter of 2013. Before discussing our first quarter results in more detail, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the major outage event that occurred in Texas in mid-February. This was a very unique winter event with unusually cold weather in a state that represents our second largest addressable market opportunity for home standby generators and highlighted yet another example of the vulnerabilities of the current electrical utility model. This was a high-profile power outage.  In fact, the fifth largest event recorded since we began tracking outages more than a decade ago, with rolling blackouts across the state that lasted for several days and impacted over 4.5 million utility customers at its peak. With the backdrop of the ongoing Home as a Sanctuary trend, we believe the outage in Texas was a dramatic reminder of the pain of losing power in today's day and age and further amplify the importance of having power security for your home or your business. Driven by this event, we experienced yet another dramatic acceleration in demand for home standby generators from the already elevated levels, increasing our lead times to approximately 28 weeks for our most popular models as of today. As a result, we have further increased our capacity expansion plans for home standby as we target even higher production levels in the second half of the year through a faster ramp of our New South Carolina facility and further expansion of capacity at our Wisconsin facilities. When combined with the broad-based strengthening of demand across the rest of our business, including a significant recovery in C&I products, which are also benefiting from the major Texas event, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and earnings outlook for 2021. We'll provide additional details regarding our updated guidance and the outlook portion of our prepared remarks this morning. Now discussing our first quarter results in more detail. Several key metrics that we monitor closely for home standby demand continues to be exceptionally strong and rose even further during the first quarter benefiting from the major event in Texas. The combination of in-home and virtual consultations once again increased dramatically compared to the prior year, with year-over-year appointments more than 5 times higher during the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2020. The strength was broad-based across the U.S. with the vast majority of states showing triple-digit growth once again which we believe provides further validation of the need for backup power given the Home as a Sanctuary megatrend. Activations, which are a proxy for installations, grew again at a strong rate compared to the prior year and were also broad-based in strength across all U.S. regions. The power outage severity environment continues to be very active during the quarter and trended well above the long-term baseline average, driven by the Texas event, but also ice storms in several states, severe storms in the Pacific Northwest, outage events in California and smaller scale rolling blackouts in other states due to severe cold temperatures. In addition, we continue to expand our distribution footprint as we ended the first quarter with approximately 7,700 residential dealers, a sequential increase of about 400 new dealers as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and approximately 1,200 dealers higher over the last 12 months, which includes the addition of a number of new dealers in California and Texas. Early here in the second quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to trend much higher relative to last year as home consultations are running more than double the prior year's level through April. We continue to believe that the ongoing strength in the product category can be attributed to several factors, which are leading to home standby generators becoming more mainstream as homeowners have an increasing awareness of the need for power security as they continue to work more from home, learn from home, entertain from home and shop from home. Now I want to provide an update on our rapidly growing clean energy product offering. The secular growth opportunity within the U.S. market for renewables, energy storage, energy monitoring and energy management remains very compelling and has gained further momentum so far here in 2021. As previously mentioned, shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year, and demand paced ahead of our expectations during the first quarter. In addition to the strong demand, key performance indicators for our clean energy-related initiatives continue to show favorable trends. In-home and virtual consultations grew rapidly as compared to the prior year and were very encouraging sequentially as compared to the fourth quarter. System activations, which were a proxy for installations and commissioning, also grew at a tremendous rate during the first quarter as compared to the prior year, and orders for clean energy products were very strong on a sequential basis during the first quarter, and this strength has continued here in April. We also have had encouraging success further building out our installer network as we've trained and certified approximately 2,000 dealers as of the end of the quarter, with approximately 800 dealers registered on our PowerPlay CE selling system. As we discussed during the last earnings call, we have an exciting pipeline of innovative clean energy products, which are expected to come to market throughout the current year. New product launches include deep integration of our PWRcell storage systems with our legacy generator products, the ability to more easily and cost effectively add a PWRcell system to an existing solar installation and the launch of a new purpose-built generator that can be combined with solar and storage to allow an end user to operate independently of the power grid. Additionally, later this year, we expect to launch a new load management system that will be paired with our existing PWRview energy monitoring platform to allow a homeowner to more fully control their power generation and consumption. We believe these product launches will further enhance our competitive position and differentiation in the energy storage, monitoring and management markets as we focus on whole home storage solutions with load management capabilities that provide both the energy independence and flexibility that we believe consumers really want in these types of systems. The solar plus storage market continues to expand rapidly within the U.S., and we are making good progress in building considerable momentum for our energy storage products. Accordingly, we are increasing our full year revenue outlook as a result of higher demand and our expanded distribution in this growing market. We now expect shipments of clean energy products to increase between 75% to 100% as compared to the prior year levels of approximately $115 million, which is an increase from the previous forecast of 50% to 75% growth. In addition, we achieved the second consecutive quarter of profitability for clean energy products during the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue sequentially for the remainder of the year as we further scale PWRcell system volumes. Recall that in October of last year, we acquired Enbala Power Networks, a leading grid services technology provider, and I'd like to provide a quick update on the progress we're making in developing a road map for integrating Enbala's Concerto software platform into our existing generator and energy storage products. As the market for grid services continues to develop, we believe integrating Enbala's technology will enable us to improve our value proposition to end users with our legacy products as well as allowing us to develop various new revenue streams in the years ahead. These will include the existing software as a service platform that Enbala offers as well as a variety of operational services that enable a more turnkey solution, and ultimately performance services that could deliver megawatts of power to various potential customers. During the first quarter, we began marketing our initial solutions, which involve our legacy products delivered with built-in capabilities to connect to the Enbala platform. These Enbala ready generic assets, known as distributed energy resources, or DERs can be available to bundle together to form a virtual power plant, or VPP solution. We're excited to currently offer this initial capability with our C&I natural gas generators, and as the year progresses, we will begin to introduce this feature with our home standby generators and our PWRcell energy storage systems. Also, over the last several quarters, the Enbala and Generac commercial sales teams have been working closely together on potential projects with utilities, energy cooperatives and energy aggregators, which has led to a considerable increase in quoting and proposal activities during the first quarter. In addition to the great performance of residential products to start the year, C&I products were also very strong as revenue returned to growth during the first quarter and increased at a strong rate compared to the prior year broadly across a number of markets and geographies as demand continues to recover at a faster pace than we had previously expected. Net sales of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel returned to solid growth in the quarter, with project quoting activity continuing to recover from the beginning of the pandemic last year and once again growing at a solid rate as compared to 2019 levels. This is leading to an improved overall order outlook for the sales channel and as a result, we're expecting attractive growth during the year. We also are expecting solid growth from the Energy Systems business. This is our industrial distributor in Northern California that we acquired last July, as our investments in integration activities are producing results in this large and rapidly growing power generation market. Shipments to telecom national account customers increased significantly during the quarter as compared to the prior year, and we're well ahead of our expectations. Several of our larger telecom customers have materially raised their capital spending outlooks for the year, leading us to now expect a substantial increase in telecom shipments during the current year relative to our prior forecast. The catalyst for the additional spending on backup power in this important vertical can be attributed to a number of factors, including the elevated power outage environment over the last several years, the power security mandate in California requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all tower locations and the build-out of wireless carriers' next-generation networks. The long-term demand outlook for telecom backup power remains very compelling, driven by the increasingly critical nature of wireless communications networks as this infrastructure shifts to the next-generation 5G architecture. Additionally, we gained further traction in the quarter with our lead gas initiatives through an increased quote activity and improved project close rates for our natural gas generators that are used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, including their use as distributed generation assets. This is an emerging part of our C&I business that already had good momentum entering the year. And the major outages in Texas have created additional demand for these products. Shipments of mobile products to national account rental customers were lower during the first quarter, but exceeded our previous expectations as the rate of decline slowed relative to recent quarters, and we expect a return to growth for these products during the second quarter. As we mentioned during our last call, we expected shipments of mobile products for full year 2021 to improve from prior year levels as national rental account customers increased their spending on fleet equipment due to improving utilization and rental rates. Several of our large national rental customers have recently increased their capital spending plans even further. And as a result, we're increasing our outlook for these products as it appears a fleet replacement cycle has begun. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for mobile products with the compelling megatrend around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could finally benefit from economic stimulus plans recently announced by the current administration. Outside of North America, we returned to growth during the first quarter with revenue increasing at a solid core rate of 10% compared to the prior year, primarily due to growth in the European region that is recovering from the impacts of the pandemic. While COVID-19 impacts and restrictions are still being felt in several international regions, larger project quoting and overall order activity is recovering at a faster pace than previously expected, leading to a significant increase in our international backlog at the end of the first quarter. As a result, our revenue outlook for the international segment has further improved as we now expect strong growth for the full year, with adjusted EBITDA margin expected to expand considerably year-over-year, benefiting from improved operating leverage on higher sales volumes. Lastly, our international teams continue to make encouraging progress on several important global initiatives around increasing the penetration of natural gas generators for residential and C&I applications and expanding our share in the market for telecom backup power in key regions around the world. In closing this morning, 2021 is developing into a year where our megatrends and macro secular themes appear to have significant momentum and are moving in the same direction as we anticipated as we are anticipating tremendous growth for our residential product and a significant rebound in demand for C&I products as compared to the prior year. A key focus for our teams is expanding capacity across the business, both within our own facilities as well as ramping our supply chain to enable our ability to continue to scale. Our operations and supply chain teams have been working aggressively to address ongoing sourcing and logistics delays, component availability constraints and the increasing cost pressures we have been experiencing. We have largely mitigated the impact of these issues up to this point, but the situation remains fluid. That being said, we believe we have appropriately risk-adjusted our latest guidance to reflect potential disruptions and additional inflationary pressures that will likely continue to materialize as the year progresses. Lastly, I have to give a shout-out to our more than 7,000 employees at Generac that have helped us successfully navigate the pandemic while still providing an incredible level of service to our customers and our partners around the world. The hyperscale growth that we are experiencing is a reflection of their commitment to the execution of our strategy and their dedication to our success. When you combine the strength of our team, with our financial strength, we believe Generac is incredibly well positioned to aggressively invest in a number of strategic initiatives to further accelerate our strategy and build out our capabilities as we continue our evolution into an energy technology solutions company. I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our first quarter results and our updated outlook for 2021. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at first quarter 2021 results in more detail. Net sales increased 70% to $807.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, an all-time record, as compared to $475.9 million in the prior year first quarter. The combination of contributions from the Energy Systems, Mean Green and Enbala acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 3% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the first quarter by product class. Residential product sales more than doubled to $542.1 million as compared to $257.6 million in the prior year, representing a 110% increase. Also, residential products improved 9% on a sequential basis as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, benefiting from the significant backlog for home standby generators entering 2021, which is in contrast to the normal seasonally lower volumes experienced during the first quarter that have averaged a 26% sequential decline over the past five years. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience robust year-over-year growth, which more than doubled during the first quarter as we made further progress increasing production levels for these products. Portable generators also experienced dramatic growth versus the prior year due to the much higher power outage activity, highlighted by the impact from the major event in Texas. In addition to this strength, shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems also grew at a significant rate as compared to the prior year, as the solar plus storage market in the U.S. continues to expand and as we build out our capabilities selling into the clean energy space. Lastly, shipments of Chore products were also much higher during the quarter, in part due to the Home as a Sanctuary trend continuing to positively impact demand for outdoor power equipment. Commercial and industrial product net sales for the first quarter of 2021 increased 18% to $202.4 million as compared to $172.1 million in the prior year quarter. This represents a return to growth for C&I products for the first time since the third quarter of 2019, with the previous four quarters being negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The strength in shipments was due to broad-based growth across a number of markets and geographies as demand is recovering at a faster pace than previously expected, both domestically and internationally in the following areas. Domestically, the growth was driven by a substantial increase in shipments to telecom national account customers due to capital spending, further improving for these customers as they continue to harden their wireless networks. Also contributing to the increase was solid growth with our industrial distributors, as well as an increase in other project opportunities as we gain traction with our lead gas initiatives. Internationally, the increase in C&I products, as previously mentioned, was primarily due to an increase in market activity, mostly in the European region, that is recovering from the impacts of the pandemic, which began during the first quarter of last year. Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring, subscription revenue and other service offerings, increased 36% to $62.9 million as compared to $46.2 million in the first quarter of 2020. There was an approximate 7% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the Energy Systems and Enbala acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. In addition, we experienced very strong growth in aftermarket service parts as a result of the higher level of power outage activity in recent quarters. A larger and growing installed base of our products also contributed to the increase versus prior year. Gross profit margin improved 370 basis points to 39.9% compared to 36.2% in the prior year first quarter. Operating expenses increased $23.2 million, or 21.2% as compared to the first quarter of 2020, but declined 610 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization due to the substantially higher sales volumes in the current year quarter. As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interests, as defined in our earnings release, was an all-time record of $214.2 million or a very strong 26.5% of net sales as compared to $86 million or 18.1% of net sales in the prior year. This substantial 840 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by the significant gross margin expansion during the quarter due to favorable sales mix, improved pricing and favorable overhead absorption, coupled with improved leverage of fixed operating expenses on the much higher sales volumes and tight cost control. Note, the favorable impact to margins during the first quarter were partially offset by the onset of higher input costs, primarily relating to higher commodities, currencies, labor, freight and logistics costs, and these are expected to have more of an impact on properly starting in the second quarter. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased a robust 84% to $693 million as compared to $376 million in the prior year quarter, with the impact of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% of the revenue growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $207.1 million, representing a very healthy 30% margin as compared to $82.8 million in the prior year or 22% of net sales. International segment sales increased 15% to $115 million as compared to $100 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales, which excludes the favorable impact of currency, increased approximately 10% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $7.1 million, or 6.2% of net sales as compared to $3.3 million or 3.3% of net sales in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2021 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $149 million as compared to $44.5 million for the first quarter of 2020. GAAP income taxes during the current year first quarter were $35.4 million or an effective tax rate of 19.1% as compared to $9.4 million or an effective tax rate of 17.9% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the significant increase in the mix of domestic pretax income in the current year, which is taxed at an approximate 25% statutory rate. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $2.33 for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.68 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $152.7 million in the current year quarter or $2.38 per share, which is also an all-time record. This compares to adjusted net income of $55.1 million in the prior year or $0.87 per share. Cash income taxes for the first quarter of 2021 were $37.9 million as compared to $7.3 million in the prior year quarter. The current year reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 20.5% for the full year 2021, which is at the lower end of the previously expected range of 20.5% to 21.5% for 2021. This compares to the prior year rate of 14% that was anticipated in the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus prior year is primarily due to the significant increase in domestic pretax income, which is taxed at a higher statutory rate. Cash flow from operations was robust at $152.5 million as compared to $11.3 million in the prior year first quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $125.8 million as compared to a negative $1 million in the same quarter last year. Both operating and free cash flow represented seasonal records for the first quarter of a year. The substantial increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher net income and a lower level of working capital investment in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher capital expenditures, which included the new facility in Trenton, South Carolina. Before discussing our updated outlook for 2021, I wanted to comment briefly on our healthy liquidity position at the end of the first quarter of '21, which allows us to confidently operate our business and accelerate our strategy. As of March 31, 2021, we had over $1 billion of liquidity comprised of $745 million of cash on hand and $300 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in June of 2023. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the first quarter was $872 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was only 1.2 times on an as reported basis. In addition, our term loan doesn't mature until December 2026. We do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date, and it has a low cost of debt of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We also have interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. Further enhancing this attractive capital structure is our strong cash flow profile with free cash flow over the last 12 months of $554 million. I'd now like to provide some additional details on our increased outlook for the full year 2021. As Aaron highlighted earlier, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and earnings outlook for 2021. The major outages in Texas have led to an acceleration in demand and backlog for home standby generators. And as a result, our operations team has further increased their capacity expansion plans, and this is leading to a significant increase in the shipment outlook for these products for the full year 2021. The Texas outages also had a notable impact on portable generator shipments and, with an active sell-through at retail, we are increasing our outlook for these products as well. Also contributing to the improved outlook is higher demand for our PWRcell energy storage systems as we continue to make further progress in building our distribution partners in the clean energy market. The outlook for C&I products has also improved considerably with a significant pick up demand for telecom national account customers, stronger outlook for domestic industrial distributors, traction with certain projects and beyond standby applications, a further recovery in demand for mobile products and an improved outlook for C&I products within the international markets. As a result of these incrementally positive end market trends, we are increasing our full year 2020 net sales guidance to now be approximately 40% to 45% growth compared to the prior year, which includes only approximately 2% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This is an increase from the previous as reported guidance of 25% to 30%. At the midpoint of the range, this updated sales growth guidance would result in a year-over-year increase in net sales of over $1 billion. This revenue outlook now assumes shipments of residential products increased at a very robust rate of over 50% as compared to the prior year. Revenue for C&I products is now expected to rebound at an even stronger rate as compared to the softer prior year comparison, a rate approximately in the mid-20% range. Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outages in line with the longer-term baseline average for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of another major power outage event in the second half of the year. Given the additional capacity expansion for home standby generators that is targeted to increase as the year progresses, we are now expecting the seasonality for revenue in 2021 to be a bit more weighted towards the second half of the year, with sales in the first half being approximately 47% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 53% weighted. Updating our margin outlook for the full year 2021. As we've discussed, there continues to be significant cost pressures, ongoing logistics delays and various capacity constraints in several areas across the supply chain, which are resulting in higher input costs relative to our previous guidance, including rising commodities, foreign currency headwinds, increased logistics costs, additional tariffs and higher wages. Furthermore, we still expect these inflationary cost pressures, together with new facility start-up costs, to be offset by favorable sales mix, pricing and cost reduction initiatives across the organization through our profit enhancement program. As a result, we expect gross margins for the full year 2021 to expand approximately 50 basis points as compared to the prior year. In addition, we continue to make operating expense investments to scale the business, support innovation and drive future revenue growth into new and existing markets. However, due to the much higher anticipated sales volumes, we should experience improved leverage on our operating expenses relative to previous guidance. As a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 24.5% to 25.5%, which is an increase from the 24% to 25% previously expected and an expansion from the 23.5% margin in the prior year. From a seasonality perspective, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins during the second and third quarters to be moderately lower relative to the first quarter, primarily due to the impact of rising input costs. However, we believe this impact will be temporary, with adjusted EBITDA margins forecasted to improve in the fourth quarter back to first quarter levels, as the rising cost pressures are anticipated to be offset by more favorable mix, additional pricing and cost reduction initiatives that are expected to be realized towards the end of the year. Operating and free cash flow generation for the full year '21 is expected to remain strong with the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow still anticipated to be approximately 90%. Our GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 22.5% to 23.5%, which is slightly lower as compared to the 23.5% to 24.5% previously expected. Our capital expenditures for 2021 as a percentage of forecasted net sales are still projected to be in the previous guidance range of between 2.5% to 3%, although with a much higher revenue outlook, this represents an increase in absolute dollar investment compared to our prior expectations, primarily due to additional capacity expansion. The remaining guidance items provided in our previous earnings call are not expected to change. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tommy Moll of Stephens.
Tommy Moll: Aaron, I wanted to start on Enbala and some of the grid services opportunities you referenced. You gave a little bit of detail to start, but anything else you can give us just in terms of how active that pipeline is? What strategies you're pursuing there? How optimistic now versus maybe a quarter ago? And then you also referenced some potential for product integration, specifically you referenced a purpose-built generator. I think that's on the home standby side. But what details can you give us there as well?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Sure. No, good questions, Tommy. On Enbala, I think our confidence grows daily with that acquisition. It just continues to reinforce our strategic direction around participating more fully in the shift to Grid 2.0, right? I mean that's really what that acquisition was about. It really was about helping us take our legacy assets, our generators, if you will, as well as our clean energy assets like PWRcell and our load management devices and really expose those distributed energy resources for the benefit of grid operators, utilities, energy aggregators and ultimately the end customers, the owner operators of those pieces of equipment. What I can say over the last quarter is we continue to dive pretty deep into the pipeline that Enbala had previous to our acquisition. It is substantially larger today than it was, that pipeline -- substantially larger today than it was when we acquired it. We believe there are a couple of reasons for this. One, during the acquisition, of course, that was -- COVID was -- we were in the middle of that, and there was some retrenchment by utilities and others on a lot of things. But certainly, programs like grid services were kind of put down -- they were set down and as they were working on other things. But the volumes have picked up dramatically here based on the fact that COVID has abated. But probably more importantly, many of these customers are telling us that they feel like now they get that Enbala has a partner in Generac that is, one, financially stable and, two, has access to all these wonderful assets, right? So, what Enbala was selling before was software, and it's agnostic software to the OEM and agnostic to even the type of DER, be it storage or be it a generating asset, and we want to maintain that because we think that's important. But I think having the opportunity to provide a full turnkey solution to a utility is really important. It really reduces the friction around which platform should the utility choose, if our assets deeply integrate with it, and we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute in our financial wherewithal to be able to do that. What we believe that's led to is just a lot more opportunities that we're seeing. So really good things to see there. On the product pipeline, you mentioned the -- we keep calling it as this purpose-built generator. This is really our off-grid generator, if you will. It's a machine that will produce direct current power. So, it will be able to charge a battery. It won't provide power to your home during a blackout, but it will be able to provide power to your battery as you deplete the battery, which could be during a blackout or some other time. We think that's a really important kind of critical missing link for those homeowners that really want to defect from the grid. And so think of it as a grid defection enabler. That product will be available later this year. And we're pretty excited about it. We've got a lot of interest in it. We'll see how many people really want to truly defect from the grid. They'll be able to do that after this product hits the market, but it's going to be an exciting launch. We're going to launch it at SPI here in September. So it should be a lot of fun.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America.
Ross Gilardi: I'm just curious, like, as you guys are scaling up the new capacity in the interim, where do you keep finding the extra capacity to get you through these quarters? And are you just driving continuous efficiencies out of your existing footprint? Are you able to sub out some additional assembly? We keep thinking you're out of capacity and can't possibly produce another unit out of your existing footprint, and you keep doing it, which is -- I mean that is a compliment, obviously, but just like how are you doing that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's a great question, Ross. And this is where I'll give a huge shout-out to our operations teams are. It's a fight every day, every hour. I mean they literally have hour by hour kind of metrics that they're pacing against, not only obviously for output, but the ability to hit the kinds of output levels that we're achieving and do it safely and to continue to produce a quality product. These are top of mind for everything we do. It's just -- it's amazing. In full disclosure, I think if you had asked me as the CEO of this company even 6 months ago, if we'd be able to achieve the levels we are at today in the existing footprint, I would have probably taken the under on that bet. I just -- I'm maybe more of a realist at heart and maybe just would have -- you never want to bet against your own team. But these folks on our team just continue to outperform. They're working very closely with our supply chain. That's obviously a major component of this to make sure we get continuous supply. We've been expanding our supply chain to dual and triple source, which has been incredibly helpful. That was an initiative we actually started back a couple of years ago now, but it's paying off very handsomely. We invested very heavily in automation over the last several years, which is also paying off quite nicely. And really, the way the teams -- to answer your question at the root of it, is the teams are continually looking at ways to improve the operations of the business. So how do we -- squeezing out 0.5 point of efficiency or 0.25 point of productivity out of our equipment, out of our teams, out of our supply chain makes a big difference at the kinds of rates that we're running right now. Again, we don't know what the future holds. Supply chain is just a really challenging area right now, everything from logistics to component availability. Everybody's talking about this. And we're no different. We have taken a pretty, I would say, I think we've properly reflected that in the guidance. We'll just say that. I think we kind of handicapped it in a way that we believe these numbers that we're going to put out are achievable based on everything we know today. If we have some improvement in the supply chain situation, maybe they go higher. We'll see. But I'm just -- I'm incredibly proud of the team. They're just -- they're doing a great job. And really, I can't say more about it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partner.
Philip Shen: Congrats on the strong results. And just kind of piggybacking off that last question. Let's say, we get a huge hurricane wildfire season this year. What kind of capacity do you have to be able to serve that increased demand? Can you help us bridge where you're at now relative to what that potential scenario could be? Any specifics? Can you talk about this capacity expansion plans, Aaron? I know you've talked about adding more in Wisconsin, more in South Carolina, and you can do it earlier. But to what degree can you quantify that? And the wait time is continuing to just go longer. Aaron, I think you talked about 28 weeks, but our recent dealer check suggests the dealers are waiting 35 weeks for the 22-kilowatt engine. So what is the plan to reduce that wait time, serve the busy season, if you will, when that comes in Q3 and 4?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Phil. There's -- capacity discussion here is a daily discussion. We had a plan that we had in place that we were going to bring Trenton online here midyear, which is effectively -- if you think of it this way, it's -- we're calling it a double-double, right? So we're effectively -- we are going to double our capacity. Where we're at today is somewhat kind of double where we were running maybe a little more than a year ago, maybe 12 to 18 months ago. And we had a pretty good line of sight to exit this year at that level. We felt pretty good that we -- we started tuning into the backlog pretty well. Notwithstanding, again, to your point about an active hurricane season, that was going to be a wildcard. But what happened here in between kind of our last plan and today was Texas. And so, as the Texas event was unfolding, we basically went back to the drawing board. And we said, look, we had a plan, it's not enough. How do we get more? We can't have lead times going out. 28 weeks is terrible, and that's the average across all channels, all customers, all products. But those lead times are -- that's too long to wait. And we're working hard to bring those in. But that recalibration of the capacity plan, simply put, just without getting too detailed, is to take our level that we're at today which we anticipated would go up somewhat by the end of this year as we brought Trenton online. But effectively, we've now made investments and plans to completely double where we're at today a year from now. So that will ramp throughout the year. And the way we're going to do that is we're going to bring Trenton up quicker. So we're going to need more people, we're going to need more equipment, and we're going to -- we've made those investments, we've made those decisions, and we're executing against that. But we're also making more investments here in Wisconsin. So the initial decision was to shift to a secondary location down in Trenton, that's not going to be enough. So we had stood up a temporary line in one of our facilities just outside of Whitewater, Wisconsin, where we build the lion's share of these products. And that temporary line, we're going to actually add another line in that facility, and we're going to augment that production through some subcontracting of component supply. So our constraints are a couple of the major components that go into the units. We're going to subcontract supply. We've got a line of sight on that. That will come online here really kind of end of Q3, beginning of Q4. So that, call it, second line in Wisconsin in that temporary facility. So, the second line that we're adding in Wisconsin, the quicker ramp of Trenton and then bringing on more equipment early next year is what gets us to doubling kind of where we're at today to where we can be tomorrow. So, if we do get an active hurricane season, we feel like that we'd be ready for that. We may still have longer lead times exiting the year than we want. But the kinds of capacity numbers we're talking about here, by the time we get out 12 months from now, are really quite big. So the ability to scale even further, I think, is going to be is going to be possible once we get through that investment process.
York Ragen: I mean we will sell our portable should we get to a major event. That's part of it.
Aaron Jagdfeld: That's part of it, too. Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab of William Blair.
Brian Drab: I am just wondering for my one question about margins, 26.5% first quarter, you're going to exit the year around that level you expect. Given all the puts and takes, you won't have -- I would guess that severe headwind -- you have severe headwinds from cost going into 2022, but you'll have a lot of additional capacity. So, can you just help us at all think about, does that 26%, 27% EBITDA margin run rate at the end of the year carry into 2022? Or is it reasonable to expect that to kind of come off of that really high level given you're running so hot?
York Ragen: Yes. I mean, I think we've said we most likely would not be catching the backlog here in 2021. So, we'll be coming into '22 with that backlog. So conceivably while we're running full steam in terms of production, those types of EBITDA margins would be sustainable. I haven't necessarily rolled out my 2022 guidance yet. But thinking out loud, that's how I'm thinking about it. Ultimately, once we catch the backlog, that's -- I guess that's yet to be determined. We don't know what type of hurricane season we're going to get this year. So I guess more to come and how that will play out in 2022. But yes, I guess I haven't necessarily laid out 2022 margin profile yet.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Well, I think the key there is where do input costs go, how much higher they go?
York Ragen: I think the message is we believe that we -- the things we're doing from a price cost efficiency, cost reduction standpoint and then elements around mix will help offset those inflationary pressures that we're seeing today. The impact of that, we believe, is going to be transitory here in the middle part of the year of 2021. That should alleviate more with the back end, to your point, Brian.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse of JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse: Most of them have been answered. I just wanted to go back to the supply chain issues. Can you just remind us what kind of the specific raw materials are? Or I guess what the major headwinds are? Is it specifically raw materials? Is it any kind of semiconductors like we're hearing with other companies? Maybe just give us an indication what that could be.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. No, Mark, it's an important question, and there's two types of headwinds here. There's cost headwinds and then there's availability headwinds. And so from a cost headwind standpoint, we use a lot of copper, aluminum and steel in our products. So obviously, as those have run here over the last 6 to 12 months, we've seen a sizable increase, and that's kind of the cost pressures that York was alluding to on the last question. And we're offsetting that with pricing and other cost out actions. Interestingly enough, the second headwind, which is availability, we're also seeing some availability issues within some of those basic materials, which is not something we've typically experienced. So finding electrical-grade steel as an example for the alternators we manufacture, which is the business entity of a generator. That's been challenging. Having to go out to the mills and buy coil stock. We're kind of jumping the supply chain in a lot of cases to get upstream to find rock coil stock to provide to our electrical grade steel lamination manufacturers. So that would be one instance of it. I would say more broadly, the electrical components are in terms of availability. We use a lot of semiconductors, a lot of microprocessors in all of our products. I would say, much more heavier use on our clean energy products, much lighter use on products like Chore products. But nonetheless, there are still a lot of microprocessors across the board. I think that one thing for us, maybe just a little bit of how we've been insulated from some of the current shortfalls you're reading about in automotive and some other areas, as much as I'd love to say, we're an incredibly lean supply chain in terms of inventory levels and whatnot. The fact of the matter is, because of the nature of our business in terms of needing to react to exogenous elements of demand, we have to keep a fair amount of safety stock, and our suppliers have to keep a fair amount of safety stock on hand to feed us when we need to double or triple our output. So, there was a fair amount of inventory in the channel, if you will, our supply chain channel, that is, as well as our own inventories. And so that's been helpful in kind of absorbing some of those shortfalls. And that being said, we definitely are looking at some problem areas ahead. Now again, we've reflected this, we think, appropriately in our guidance. So, there are some areas of our business that I'll just point out clean energy. I mean the demand for clean energy is much higher than what we can produce, simply because of some of the constraints we have on availability at the electronics level, also battery cell production levels. There's constraints there as well. And we're monitoring that, and we're looking at ways we can mitigate that. But we've more heavily reflected that in the guidance for that business. And still, we're saying we're up 75% to 100% in clean energy year-over-year. But it's been a challenge. We're going to continue to manage it to the best of our ability. But there's quite a few headwinds out there, but I think our teams have a pretty good handle on it, and we're going to continue to keep fighting here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Nice work. A lot of high-level questions have been asked. I'm curious what you're seeing in terms for HSB? What you're seeing for emergence of replacement and upgrade market as well as new construction penetration?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. That's a great question. And we watch this very, very closely. As we've said in the past, the replacement rate is roughly about 10% today. We get quarterly updates. That's up nicely. We get quarterly updates on what the replacement rates are. We survey people who buy products. Are they buying it for replacement? Are they buying it as a new home? Are they buying it as an existing home? So, in new construction, it's 15% to 20% of the products going into new construction. So, both of those trends are favorable and have been favorable over the long haul. The replacement trend, I think, is maybe the most favorable because when you really just peel back the math on it, and I think we showed this a couple of years ago at an Investor Day, and we may have to update this coming up here in our Investor Day in September. But the replacement rate itself was worth quite a bit of money there, just over the long haul.  And so -- and that, I think, as technology continues to improving the products and in particular, as those products become grid services enabled, right, in Enbala-ready, the idea of the newer products being in Enbala-ready and the old ones not, that becomes an asset that could be producing for somebody in a different way than just protecting their home. It could be something that is able to be monetized. So pretty interesting stuff there. The remote monitoring capabilities that we've added to products over the years also don't exist in generational products 10, 15 years ago. So really interesting trends longer term, and I think they're bullish for us and bullish for the category.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jed Dorsheimer of Canaccord Genuity.
Jed Dorsheimer : I'll echo the sentiments. Congratulations on great execution. So I guess for my question, on the home standby, sort of an easy trend to call with respect to the work-from-home phenomenon, and you guys have executed flawlessly on that. Just maybe my question on turning to sort of the commercial and industrial. And if we look at the trend, if I'm a REIT and I own either industrial property or even an office or hospital post archive and knowing that this work-from-home phenomenon is that there's going to need to be a law to get tenants to come back into the properties. I'm curious where you think from the conversations, where we're at in terms of, to use baseball analogy, sort of the innings of using guaranteed power is one of the benefits in terms of that and whether or not the fact that the structure of that REIT in having to spend the money from a tax perspective, if you're starting to see that benefit yet, and that's what we saw in these results.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I think, Jed, it might be a little early to be saying it's reading through today, maybe a little bit, but really we've always looked at the sales cycle and just that -- those products because they're budgetary items generally for a business or even a hospital, in some cases. Those are little more quote-driven. But really, we bifurcate the C&I world into two markets. There's the quote-driven and then there's the optional standby markets within just purely standby, right? So, quote-driven markets are clear, where you've got to provide backup power because of a wastewater treatment plan, a hospital, some other installation where quotes require that. That's a simple bid process and would be something that is about half of the market. The other half of the market then is made up of what we refer to as this optional standby market. And that's really a decision for a business or a business owner, who says, look, I have interruption of my -- maybe it's my revenue streams or I have spoilage of inventory or I have some other thing that happens when the power goes out, it's a negative for my business, and I want to protect that and protect against that, so I invest in backup power. I think the idea there and what we've typically seen is we'll see a follow-on period here for a couple of years, especially after an event like Texas, the magnitude of that event. We'll see increased quotations activity which we're seeing today, increased activity around what types of solutions make sense. You can talk to the specifying engineering firms that are involved in projects like this, down in that region of the country. And they will tell you that there's a lot of inbound interest around businesses and other types of properties looking at adding a backup generator. I think what gets really interesting for me is when you can take that backup generator, and C&I is really -- it makes a lot of sense here. You can turn it into a distributed energy resource. Now you're talking about a big chunky block of power that you can take 400, 500, 1 megawatt -- 400 kw 500 kw, 1 megawatt, 2 megawatts of power in a single installation with a single owner that you can put back into the grid. And that's incredibly valuable for ERCOT or for any of the other -- PJM -- any of the other grid operators out there or utility companies even themselves who can use that asset to help them balance supply and demand. And so that's kind of the new frontier, right? And that's why we invested in Enbala. You're going to see us continue to push even further in this. And I mentioned it just briefly in the prepared remarks about, we call it our lead gas initiatives here, which is really about using a natural gas generator for those purposes because in those instances, you're just talking about a cleaner burning machine. The economics are much better around gas. We use a rich burn configuration machine. So it can do quick startup to protect against blackouts as well as provide power back to the grid. So we're the leader in that industry and have been for many, many years. And we're incredibly excited. And that's where we've been getting the most interest actually with the Enbala acquisition. As I was mentioning, those sales teams, Enbala and our teams working together many of the projects that we're talking about are natural gas generator projects and larger blocks of power for distribution centers, for manufacturing plants, for other types of installations, critical or noncritical. And I think that's going to be really important because that's really more of energy as a service. If you think about it down the line, that's what it turns into. And I think that's going to be a really exciting part of the growth story for C&I as we go forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Let me add my congratulations to the strong performance as well. I'm wondering if you could talk about how much your PWRcell production was up in the quarter, and you mentioned you increased your expectations for the year. Maybe just quantify that for us? And if you could just touch on whether you have enough battery capacity with your existing supplier relationship or any additional plans to augment the supply base?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Thanks, Jerry. PWRcell has been incredibly well received. We're doing well to take some good market share there in a growing market, which is awesome. And we continue to roll out new products, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. But as it relates to supply chain and capacity, I mentioned briefly the battery cell capacity constraints, which anybody, who's electrifying anything today, is dealing with the same situations, and we're no different. We brought on a second source here in the first quarter to augment our primary source of battery cells, battery packs. We'll be bringing on in the second half of the year a third and potentially even fourth source to continue to kind of broaden the supply base for those products. That being said, again, we -- as I said before, we've kind of reflected in our guidance. Even though we're talking about a 75% to 100% growth rate year-over-year for clean energy products, we're really -- it could be higher. The demand is much higher. I mean the inbound demand that we're seeing in those product categories is phenomenal, and it's very exciting. And I think this is really ahead of any kind of -- all the major policy changes that are being proposed out there, right? We really didn't even touch on that today much, but the current administration has a whole host of kind of plans and proposals out there related to increasing and extending the investment tax credit, actually giving an ITC credit, making that available for storage only, which is something that would be very interesting, I think, for people, who are looking to add storage to an existing solar array or use storage perhaps as an arbitrage opportunity. So, we need to continue to work on capacity as, I think, the takeaway here. Our teams are looking at that very hard. And longer term, I think that we're going to need to do some other things there that I think we're probably prepared to talk a little bit more deeply about once we get to our Investor Day in September. But as it relates to what we did in Q1, I guess, York 
York Ragen: I think we said in the prepared remarks. So shipments obviously did grow dramatically. I think what was encouraging where orders, or demand actually was up sequentially from Q4 to Q1, actually better than expectations. So that was the driver of taking our outlook up. There's a lot of momentum on the distribution side for these products, took our outlook up to growing 75% to 100%. At the midpoint of that range, that would be about a $100 million increase in shipments of those products year-over-year. So, a lot of encouraging signs. And again, that's better than we had originally expected. And I think the key there is we'll be ramping volumes throughout the year. Margin profile will ramp throughout the year. And we're going to have attractive margin profile as well on top of that.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America.
Ross Gilardi: I just had a quick follow-up. Where is the backlog by the end of the year, if you get your capacity where you want and you get normal order activity for the balance of the year based on a number of product activity?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's a great question. And obviously, the big wildcard and that kind of equation or formula is what kind of a season do we see this fall. And so, I think it's really difficult for me to just kind of spout out a number here because I don't know what the season holds for us. We really want to bring the backlog down in terms of the lead times. We'd love to see that get a lot shorter as we go forward. And that's something that we're working hard to as we ramp capacity. As I said, the South Carolina facility, the team there, we've got a plan that basically doubles where we thought we were going to be at the end of the year. In terms of exiting the year down in Trenton, we want to be twice as high as we thought we'd be. And then again, augmenting that with more production in Wisconsin here. So, we're going to grow into a really big capacity number by the time we hit kind of Q2 of next year. But the season could -- if the season plays out to be an active one and there are quite a number of forecasts out there saying that, and that's just the hurricane season. I guess I haven't touched on the fire season out west, it's been incredibly dry out west and very dangerous situation there. Already seeing fire activity out in the northwest in Washington. Californians, I think, are really on edge with where that could go. So
York Ragen: Lots of interest in Texas.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Tons of interest in Texas coming off of the outages there. So again, we're trying to reflect what we think is an appropriate level of…
York Ragen: Either way, we're not going to be catching our back.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We're not going to catch it. We're going to come out of the year with a fair amount of backlog. It's just a question of what the magnitude of that number is. And just not in a position yet to size that.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Michael Harris: Great. We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2021 earnings results with you in late July. Thank you again, and goodbye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-11 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. At this time all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference to you Mike Harris, Vice President and Corporate Development of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Harris: Good morning and welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time to time to Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable US GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter was a tremendous finish to 2020 for Generac with all-time record performance for both the quarter and full year net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Fourth quarter shipments, margins and profitability were all well ahead of our previous expectations. The revenue outperformance was primarily due to higher shipments of home standby generators from better than expected production output. We're also pleased that shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems met our aggressive expectations during the quarter. The ongoing elevated level of power outages, combined with the emerging Home as a Sanctuary trend, continued to drive unprecedented levels of demand for home standby generators across the entire US. We continue to aggressively ramp production levels for home standby throughout the fourth quarter to all-time record daily build rates. Despite this expanding production, the ongoing robust demand created substantial backlog for these products at the end of the year, far exceeding anything previously experienced in the history of the product category. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased approximately 28% on a core growth basis as compared to the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily driven by the dramatic increase in sales of home standby generators, followed by the continued ramp of PWRcell energy storage systems. In addition, the higher power outage activity also drove elevated shipments of portable generators and aftermarket service parts, and chore products also improved at a strong rate as compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting this significant strength was the decline in shipments of C&I products, given the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin expanded 180 basis points compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 380 basis points over the prior year to an impressive 25.7%, which was the highest margin reported since the fourth quarter of 2013. Before discussing fourth quarter results in more detail, I wanted to provide some full year 2020 financial highlights, as well as share some key accomplishments that we achieved during the year. First and foremost, I want to highlight the company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic as I'm extremely proud of our team's efforts in responding to the crisis as we focused on maintaining our operations to the fullest extent possible. This was particularly important considering that our products and services are both essential and critical to help keep a variety of networks and infrastructure up and running, including hospitals, healthcare clinics, 911 call centers, and wireless networks. Equally as important, we accomplished this while at the same time implementing a wide range of preventive measures to address the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers, suppliers and the communities across the world where we operate and do business. Through the tireless execution of our nearly 7,000 employees globally during 2020, Generac achieved another year of record financial results across the board, and several metrics far exceeded the previous record levels seen for the full year 2019. Revenue grew 13% for the full year with adjusted EBITDA coming in at $584 million, an expansion of 290 basis points to 23.5%. And we generated $427 million of free cash flow during the year. Our ability to execute on the step function increase in demand for residential products that has emerged from the new Home as a Sanctuary megatrend was an important accomplishment during 2020. In addition, the building out of our clean energy market opportunity with a significant ramp in shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems was a key highlight. We also expanded our product and services portfolio with the acquisitions of Energy Systems, our industrial distributor located in Northern California and Mean Green, a leading manufacturer of an innovative line of battery powered turf care products. We also made the very strategic acquisition of Enbala Power Networks, which enables our entrance into the developing market for grid services. We launched important new products during the year with the introduction of the 24 kilowatt home standby generator, the market's most powerful air cooled unit with built-in energy monitoring. We also introduced the industry's largest rich burn industrial natural gas generator set at 1.1 megawatt of output, allowing us to target new market opportunities. All of these key accomplishments, as well as our execution on a number of other strategic initiatives, enabled us to make important progress on our continuing evolution to an energy technology solutions company. Our prior year accomplishments provide us with tremendous momentum as we head into 2021. The guidance we are initiating this morning calls for significant revenue growth of between 25% to 30%, highlighted by unprecedented home standby demand, continued expansion of the clean energy markets and recovering C&I markets. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to expand to 24% to 25% for the full year 2021, despite near-term supply chain concerns related to capacity constraints, increasing cost pressures and logistics delays across the business as we enter the New Year. York will provide more details on our 2021 guidance in the outlook portion of our prepared remarks today. Now let me provide a few more details on our accomplishments across the business for the fourth quarter and for full year 2020. Several key metrics that we monitor closely for home standby demand continued to be exceptionally strong during the fourth quarter. The combination of in-home and virtual consultations once again increased dramatically compared to the prior year. Broad based strength was experienced across the US during the fourth quarter, similar to the trends seen in recent quarters, with the vast majority of states showing triple-digit growth, which we believe provides further validation for the emerging Home as a Sanctuary trend. Activations also grew at a strong rate compared to the prior year, led by significant increases in the South Central, Southeast, and Northeast regions. The power outage severity environment also continued to be quite favorable and trended well above the long-term baseline average, benefiting from a record Atlantic hurricane season, early winter storms and continued power shut-offs in California. We also ended the fourth quarter with approximately 7,300 residential dealers, an increase of approximately 800 dealers over the last 12 months. This includes the addition of a significant number of new dealers in California during the year as we ended 2020 with approximately 550 dealers in the state. Importantly, thus far in the first quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to trend much higher relative to prior year levels. Home consultations are tracking at approximately double the prior year levels through early February. We believe this increase can be attributed to several factors that are leading to the product category becoming more mainstream as homeowners have an increasing awareness of the need for power security as they continue to work from home, learn from home, entertain from home, and shop from home. With demand for home standby generators at all-time highs, we've continued to aggressively ramp our supply chain and production output, and we achieved progressively higher record daily build rates throughout the fourth quarter. We expect to further expand capacity for these products with our announcement yesterday of plans to open a new manufacturing assembly and distribution operation in Trenton, South Carolina. The facility will support increased demand for home standby generators and certain other energy technology products and serve as a distribution center to customers in the Southeastern part of the country, creating approximately 450 new jobs over the next two years. The facility is expected to be operational by mid-year, and once fully ramped is projected to increase home standby capacity by approximately 75% relative to our previous normal levels as we entered 2020, with the ability to further expand the facility well beyond its current size in the future. Our Operations teams did an amazing job during 2020 ramping production of -- production output of home standby generators to record daily build rates by the end of the year. But despite the significant increase in output, lead times for home standby generators continue to expand from the approximately 18 weeks at the end of 2022 to approximately 20 weeks today. As a result, the substantial backlog for these products continues to grow so far here in the first quarter, despite our normal seasonal low point for residential products as home consultations and orders remain very robust. Now I want to provide an update this morning on our rapidly expanding energy storage systems effort and recent entrance into the grid services market. We made tremendous progress during 2020 with our continuing transformation into an energy technology solutions company, as we significantly ramped deliveries of our PWRcell energy storage system and with our entry into the market for grid services through the Enbala acquisition last October. The secular growth opportunity within the US market for renewables, energy storage, energy monitoring and energy management systems remains very compelling and has considerable momentum as we head into 2021. As previously mentioned, shipments of our PWRcell energy storage systems met our aggressive expectations during the fourth quarter as revenue for these products continue to ramp as they increased approximately 75% on a sequential basis and were a key contributor to the company's year-over-year growth. Overall for 2020, shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems increased significantly during the first year of commercial launch, particularly during the second half, and were in line with our previous guidance of approximately $115 million for the full year. The tremendous growth in energy storage from essentially a start-up business was due to the important advances we have made in growing our capabilities around marketing, distribution, product development and sourcing of these products. We further developed and refined our targeted marketing and home consultation processes and have been very encouraged by the trends with sales leads for PWRcell systems as they continue to be strong during the fourth quarter and have increased further here in the early parts of the first quarter. System activations, which are a proxy for installations and commissioning, also continued to ramp notably during the fourth quarter with this strength continuing so far through the early part of 2021. An important element of expanding our sales and marketing efforts for clean energy is the progress we continue to make building out the distribution network for these products as we trained approximately 4,200 energy storage consultants or contractors in 2020. We continue to receive positive feedback from our growing dealer base regarding the ease of installation, the whole home power and capacity of the PWRcell systems and the qualified sales leads being generated for them. We have continued -- also continue to advance our supply chain capabilities through increased volume and reduced system costs and achieved our first full quarter of profitability during Q4. We also had several important new product introductions last year, and we have a very strong pipeline of innovative new clean energy related products that will be coming to market over the next several quarters. This includes deep integration with our legacy generator products and includes the launch later this year of a purpose-built generator solution that can be combined with a solar and storage system to allow an end user to operate independently of the power grid. Additionally, we will be launching the ability to more easily and cost effectively add a PWRcell storage system to an existing solar installation. And later in 2021, we expect to launch a new load management system that will be paired with our existing PWRview energy monitoring platform to allow a homeowner to more fully control their power generation and consumption. We believe this system will be an industry -- will be industry-leading in terms of the technology and cost and will enable far greater control at the circuit level than is available today. When added as part of a solar and storage installation, a homeowner could effectively tailor their system to optimize for lowest cost or longest duration or some combination depending on their preferences or certain other factors. An example would be to allow the system to react to a power outage by prioritizing those loads deemed critical by a homeowner to extend the duration of their available energy storage. We believe these product launches will further enhance our competitive position and differentiation in the energy storage, monitoring and management markets as we focus on whole house storage solutions with load management capabilities that provide the energy, independence and flexibility we believe consumers really want in these systems. The solar plus storage market continues to expand rapidly, and we expect to see significant year-over-year growth during 2021 as shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems are anticipated to increase substantially as we're expecting them to grow approximately 50% to 75% as compared to 2020 levels. Recall, early in the fourth quarter that we closed on the acquisition of Enbala Power Networks, a leading distributed energy resources technology company based in Denver, Colorado. Enbala's best in class software platform called Concerto, gives utilities, grid operators and energy retailers the ability to connect and utilize distributed energy resources, also known as DERs, to help support the operational stability of the power grid, thereby enabling us to participate in the nascent and growing market opportunity for grid services. DER assets, which include our legacy residential and C&I generators, PWRcell energy storage systems and load management devices, can be connected to the Concerto platform and can be aggregated into a decentralized and virtual power plant network or VPP. A VPP provides flexible capacity to address peaks in electricity demand, variability in supply due to increasing use of renewables and when resiliency is needed as a result of power outages. While still very early in the integration process, we have made progress in developing a roadmap for integrating Enbala's software into our existing generator products and energy storage systems as part of an overall plan to provide a full suite of solutions for utilities, energy retailers, grid operators, and end users. As the market for grid services continues to develop, we believe the integration of Enbala's technology will enable us to not only improve our value proposition to end users with our legacy products, but will also allow us to participate and develop new revenue streams in the years ahead. The solutions will be built around our products that generate, store and manage power and that can be aggregated and controlled resulting in the potential for revenue from sales of software platforms, turnkey operation services and ultimately performance services that can deliver megawatts of power. All of these efforts are targeted at enabling the equipment we provide to be connected more seamlessly as DERs in grid services applications, and in turn, improve the value proposition of these assets, which we believe will lead to increased demand for our products. Now shifting gears, let me provide an update on C&I. As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an adverse impact on the overall market for global C&I power generation and related equipment given major declines in GDP growth rates around the world. While uncertainty remains around the pandemic, we are encouraged that the year-over-year revenue decline moderated at certain end markets began to show signs of recovery. As expected, shipments of mobile products to national rental account customers continued to decline significantly during the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. As we dealt with the challenging demand environment for mobile products throughout 2020, we focused our efforts on cost reductions and other restructuring actions, which we began implementing during the second quarter of last year. As we enter 2021, we expect shipments to improve from prior year levels as national account rental customers increase their spending on fleet equipment. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for mobile products as an expected fleet replacement cycle begins and the compelling mega trend that remains intact around the critical need for infrastructure improvements, which could potentially benefit from economic stimulus. Shipments to national telecom customers increased at a significant rate during the quarter as compared to the prior year, with the magnitude of the increased pacing ahead of our prior expectations. We continue to see indications from several of our large telecom customers of an improving outlook, and we expect that to translate into very strong growth in shipments during 2021. Recall that demand trends for these customers can vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of their capital spending and their project planning cycles. Historically, however, demand for telecom backup power tends to increase after periods of elevated power outage activity, similar to what was experienced with the outage environment during the second half of 2020. In addition, revenue growth during the current year is expected to benefit from the power security mandate in California, which requires a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all cell tower locations. We estimate that this new requirement in the state, which went into effect at the beginning of this year, could lead to purchases of between $100 million to $200 million in new equipment from wireless operators over the next three years. Also shipments to other national account customers are expected to show a considerable ramp in 2021 as we gain traction with our lead gas initiatives through increasing quote activity and improving project close rates for our natural gas generators, which are used in applications beyond traditional emergency standby power generation, including their use as distributed generation assets. Lastly, net sales of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel were lower in the quarter as expected due to the timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of 2019, which created a difficult prior year comparison. As mentioned on our last call, project quoting activity has largely recovered since the onset of the pandemic during the second quarter, contributing to a higher backlog and improved overall order outlook for this channel. And as a result, we're expecting growth to resume during 2021. We're also expecting growth from the Energy Systems business, our industrial distributor located in Northern California that we acquired on July 1st of last year, as our investments in integration activities begin to produce results in this large and rapidly growing power generation market. Internationally, the ongoing global pandemic continues to have a negative impact on C&I product demand during the fourth quarter as well. As GDP growth rate slowed materially around the world in 2020, revenues for our International segment in the fourth quarter declined approximately 6% on a core basis when compared to the prior year. This decline was driven by continued weakness in a number of key regions around the world. But overall, international revenue during the fourth quarter was largely in line with our expectations. Similar to our domestic C&I products business, the international year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter was at a notably lesser rate relative to recent quarters as signs of recovery began to appear in certain regions. While COVID-19 impacts are still being felt, larger project quoting and order activity is increasing, and we expect the international segment to return to solid growth during 2021. Also, it's important to reiterate that our international teams remain focused on several critical global initiatives around increasing the penetration of natural gas generators for residential and C&I applications, expanding our share in the wireless telecom backup power segment globally, and entering the emerging energy storage market for both residential and C&I applications. In closing this morning, in recent years we have continued to make important progress on evolving our business model from a focus on clean energy products -- with a focus on clean energy products, solutions and services aligned with the change -- the changing legacy electric utility model. In 2019, we began providing energy storage, monitoring and management systems as clean energy solutions for residential use, and last year we entered the market for grid services involving distributed energy optimization and control software that will help support the operational stability of the power grid. We have also been focused over the last several years on connecting the legacy standby generators we manufacture, including building out our digital platform that creates tremendous value for our customers and our distribution partners over the product life cycle. As the leader in backup power solutions, we believe we're in the unique position to enable the potential utilization of these products as distributed energy resources on a very large scale, thereby providing us with a distinct advantage as the nascent market for grid services expands over the next several years. Going forward, we intend to further build out our capabilities as an energy technology solutions provider through organic investment and continued acquisitions. We expect to expand our energy storage capabilities beyond residential applications in the C&I markets and eventually globally, and further expand our capabilities with energy monitoring and management devices and grid services. These are incredibly exciting times at Generac as we've now built an incredible foundation for growth, and we have the financial flexibility to be a major player in developing the energy grid of the future. I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on the fourth quarter results and some outlook details of 2021. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in more detail. Net sales increased 28.8% to $761.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, an all-time record as compared to $590.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The combination of contributions from the Energy Systems, Mean Green and Enbala acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 1% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Net sales for the full year 2020 increased 12.7% to approximately $2.5 billion, also an all-time record for the company. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class, residential product sales during the fourth quarter increased 54.6% to $498.7 million as compared to $322.5 million in the prior year. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience robust year-over-year growth, which accelerated to over 40% during the fourth quarter as we made further progress increasing production levels for these products. In addition to this strength, shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems continued to significantly ramp during the quarter as the solar plus storage market expands at a rapid pace in the US and we continue to build out our capability selling into the clean energy space. Also contributing to the growth were a large increase in shipments of portable generators during the quarter, which benefited from the much higher power outage activity as compared to the prior year. Lastly, shipments of chore products were also much higher during the quarter as the Home as a Sanctuary trend positively impacted demand for outdoor power equipment. Commercial industrial product net sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 declined 8.5% to $198.6 million as compared to $217.1 million in the prior year quarter. The weakness in shipments of C&I products was experienced both domestically and internationally in the following areas. Domestically, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in our national rental account customers to defer capital spending for our mobile products, and shipments to our industrial distributors also declined against a particularly strong prior year comparison. Partially offsetting these declines was a significant increase in shipments to national telecom account customers due to the capital spending outlook improving for these customers. Internationally, C&I products declined due to the continued weakness in demand across the majority of regions around the world as a result of the pandemic. As mentioned, while still experiencing a year-over-year sales decline during the fourth quarter, the rate of decline for C&I products continued to moderate at certain end markets begin to recover. Net sales for the other products and services -- products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service products, product accessories, extended warranty revenue, remote monitoring subscription revenue and other service offerings increased 24.4% to $63.8 million as compared to $51.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. There was an approximate 7% benefit to net sales during the quarter from the impacts of the Energy Systems and Enbala acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. In addition, we experienced very strong growth in aftermarket service parts as a result of the higher level of power outage activity during the second half of the year. A larger and growing installed base of our products also contributed to the increase versus the prior year. Gross profit margin improved 180 basis points to 39.4% compared to 37.6% in the prior year fourth quarter. Operating expenses increased $11.4 million or 9.7% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, but declined 270 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization. As a result, adjusted EBITDA, before deducting for non-controlling interests as defined in our earnings release, was $195.8 million or a very strong 25.7% of net sales as compared to $129.1 million or 21.9% of net sales in the prior year. This 380 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by the significant gross margin expansion during the quarter, primarily due to the favorable sales mix, coupled with improved leverage of fixed operating expenses on the much higher sales volumes and tight cost control. For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA, before deducting for non-controlling interests, came in at an all-time record of $584 million resulting in an attractive 23.5% margin or a 290 basis point increase compared to the prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 37.2% to $645.1 million as compared to $470.1 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter was $188 million or 29.1% of net sales as compared to $122.9 million in the prior year or 26.1% of net sales. For the full year 2020, domestic segment sales increased 19.8% over the prior year to $2.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were 27%, representing a 240 basis point increase compared to the prior year. International segment sales, which consist primarily of C&I products, declined 4.1% to $116 million as compared to $120.9 million in the prior year quarter. Foreign currency had a net favorable impact of approximately 140 basis points on revenue growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter, before deducting for non-controlling interest, was $7.8 million or 6.8% of net sales as compared to $6.2 million or 5.2% of net sales in the prior year. For the full year 2020, International segment sales declined 14.1% over the prior year to $396 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment, before deducting for non-controlling interest, were 5.1% of net sales during the 2020 compared to 5.5% of net sales in the prior year. Now, switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $125 million as compared to $69.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. GAAP income taxes during the current year fourth quarter were $39 million or an effective tax rate of 23.8% as compared to $13.4 million or an effective tax rate of 16.1% for the prior year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the significant increase in pre-tax income in the current year, while the prior-year quarter was impacted by more favorable discrete tax items, including a year-end revaluation adjustment related to a reduction in the blended state income tax rate. For the full year, the effective tax rate for 2020 was 22.2% compared to 21.1% in the prior year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.97 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $1.12 in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release was $135.7 million in the current year quarter or $2.12 per share, which was also an all-time record. This compares to adjusted net income of $96.5 million in the prior year or $1.53 per share. Cash income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $34.9 million as compared to $8.2 million in the prior year quarter. The current year now reflects a cash income tax rate of 17.9% for the full year 2020, which is an increase from the approximately 16% rate previously expected for 2020. This also compares to the prior year rate of 15%. The increase in the current year cash tax rate versus the prior year was primarily due to higher pre-tax income, which is taxed at the higher domestic statutory rate. Cash flow from operations was robust at $218.2 million as compared to $175.1 million in the prior year fourth quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $190.7 million as compared to $160.3 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher net income in the current year quarter, partially offset by the lower monetization of working capital and higher capital expenditures relative to the prior year. Before discussing our guidance initiation for 2021, I want to make a few comments regarding our healthy balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 which allows us to confidently operate our business and accelerate our strategy. As of December 31, 2020, we had nearly $1 billion of liquidity, comprised of $655 million of cash on hand and $300 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in June 2023. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter was $885 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was only 1.5 times on an as reported basis. In addition, our term loan doesn't mature until December 2026. We do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date, and it has a low cost of debt of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We also have interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. Further enhancing our overall liquidity is our strong cash flow profile. And for the full year 2020, free cash flow was easily an all-time record of $427 million as compared to $251 million in 2019, which was our previous record. Uses of cash during 2020 included $69 million for acquisitions, $62 million for capital expenditures and $25 million for the net repayment of debt. Lastly, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we have significant resources to drive further shareholder value as we execute on our long-term strategic priorities. With that, I will now provide further comments on our new outlook for 2021. Key demand metrics for home standby generators, including home consultations and orders, continue to trend much higher during the fourth quarter relative to prior year levels, and this strength has continued thus far in the first quarter. Due to this ongoing unprecedented demand, which has extended lead times for these products, there was a substantial backlog awards for home standby generators at the end of 2020, which has further increased thus far in the first quarter. As we expand manufacturing capacity during 2021 with a new facility coming online, we expect to further ramp production levels for home standby generators, helping to alleviate this backlog. In addition, the solar plus storage market is expected to experience significant year-over-year growth during 2021 as storage attachment rates continue to climb, leading to the expectation of substantial growth in shipments of PWRcell energy storage systems as we continue to build out our presence in this market. Although demand for C&I products during 2020 was negatively impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the year-over-year revenue declines continue to moderate, and shipments for these products are expected to return to growth during 2021 across a number of key end markets and geographies. As a result of this positive top-line outlook, we are initiating guidance for 2021 that anticipates significant revenue growth as compared to the prior year. Net sales are expected to increase between 25% to 30% as compared to the prior year on an as reported basis, which includes only approximately 2% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This revenue outlook assumes shipments of residential products increase at a very robust rate during 2021, a rate that is similar to the year-over-year growth rate experienced in 2020. Revenue for C&I products is expected to rebound at a strong rate as compared to the softer prior-year comparisons, a rate approximately in the mid-teens range. Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outages during the year in line with the long-term baseline average. However, consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year, such as a category 3 or higher landed hurricane. Given current capacity constraints for home standby, the upside of a major power outage event would be more limited to incremental portable generator shipments during 2021, meaning any extra lift for home standby generators from a major power outage event would most likely spill over into 2022. Due to the significant home standby backlog at the end of 2020, we are expecting the quarterly seasonality in 2021 to be more level loaded relative to normal historical patterns, with sales in the first half being approximately 48% weighted and sales in the second half being approximately 52% weighted. As a result, total year-over-year growth is forecasted to be approximately 50% for each of the first and second quarters of the year. Looking at margin profile as we enter 2021, there are near-term cost pressures, ongoing logistics delays and various capacity constraints in several areas across the supply chain which are resulting in higher input costs, including rising commodities, foreign currency headwinds, increased logistics costs, additional tariffs, and higher wages. We expect these inflationary cost pressures, together with new facility start-up costs, to be largely offset by favorable sales mix, pricing and cost reduction initiatives across the organization through our Profit Enhancement Program. As a result, we expect gross margins for full year 2021 to be similar to the second half of 2020 run rate. In addition, we continue to make operating expense investments to scale the business, support innovation and drive future revenue growth into new and existing markets. As a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are expected to be approximately 24% to 25%, which is an increase from the 23.5% reported for the full year 2020. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins during the first half of the year to be moderately lower, between 50 basis points to 100 basis points, relative to the second half of 2021, given the full realization benefit from pricing and cost reduction issues in the back half of the year. As is our normal practice, we are providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for 2021. For 2021, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to increase to between 23.5% to 24.5% as compared to the 22.2% full year rate for 2020. This increase was driven by higher pre-tax income and a higher mix of domestic pre-tax income relative to the prior year. Based on our guidance provided for 2021, our cash income tax expense for the year is expected to be approximately $135 million to $140 million, which translates into an anticipated full year 2021 cash income tax rate of between 20.5% to 21.5% as compared to the 17.9% rate for the full year 2020. As a reminder, our approximate $30 million per year tax shield, that originated from the LVO transaction in 2006, fully expires at the end of this year. As a result, 2021 is the last year that adjusted earnings will benefit from a notably lower cash income tax rate relative to our GAAP income tax rate. Beginning in 2022, the cash tax rate is expected to be more in line with the GAAP tax rate in the 25% to 27% range. In 2021, we expect interest expense to be approximately $34 million, assuming no additional principal payments during the year and flat LIBOR rates throughout 2021. Our capital expenditures for 2021 reflect continued investments in expanding capacity and are projected to be between 2.5% to 3% of our forecasted net sales for the year. This CapEx guidance includes the new Trenton, South Carolina facility and related equipment that we expect to bring online during the second half of 2021. Depreciation expense is forecasted to be approximately $40 million in 2021, given our assumed capital spending guidance. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2021 is expected to be approximately $34 million to $35 million during the year. Stock compensation expense is expected to be between $20 million to $24 million for the year. For our full-year 2021 operating and free cash flow generation is once again expected to be strong and follow historical seasonality, benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow expected to be approximately 90% for the year. Finally, our full-year diluted share count is expected to increase and be approximately 64 to 65.5 -- 64 million to 64.5 million shares. This compares to 63.7 million shares in 2020. This 2021 outlook does not reflect potential business acquisitions or stock buybacks, This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, I'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question, Philip Shen from ROTH Capital.
Philip Shen: Hey guys, congrats on the strong results.
York Ragen: Hey, Phil.
Philip Shen: Okay. It just seems like you guys are just running flat out, running at call it 24 hours, 7 days a week, 3 shifts. And with your strong guidance, I think you alluded to this. If there is an outage or some kind of event, there might be a limited upside, and it might be limited to portables just because it seems like you're maxed out. When do you guys think you can catch up and kind of get ahead of the curve here? The facility announcement is definitely a great start, and it seems like you might be able to get 2X -- you talked about 75% more capacity. But we looked at the facility, it looks like maybe you can get the 2X of that number. And at one point, Aaron, I think you were talking about being able to get the ability to expand to 5X, that 75%. So, I was wondering if this location gives you that potential. Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, it's -- I mean obviously capacity right now, Phil, is we're, as you say, we're flat out, and we're starting to see actually capacity pressures even in our C&I business which, thankfully, we have a brand new plant down in Mexico that we brought online last year. We haven't talked a ton about it, but it's a beautiful facility. It's primarily there to serve the Latin American market consolidation of our previous operations down in Mexico City, but we can use that facility as well for other things. And we'll probably end up doing some products for the US and Canada down there simply just because we're going to be up against some capacity things here too, especially in the smaller C&I ranges for telecom. The telecom business is looking like it's -- the line-up there is pretty strong relative to demand. But on the -- back on the home standby side. Yes, the new facility in Trenton is going to be a big boost. You're right, the 75% improvement that we say or increase that we've been indicating in capacity was off of the previous capacity limitations as we entered 2020. So we did raise those numbers over the course of 2020. So in effect with that new facility coming online, we can get more -- more capacity. And then that site is actually expandable about 2, 2.5 times its existing size today if we choose to go that route. So to answer your question, when do we see catching this? We're going to be working hard all year long to do that. Remember, recall that we do have some temporary production that we stood up in one of our other facilities here in Wisconsin. The initial plan was to take that down as we ramped up the Trenton facility over the summer. We could choose to leave if demand remains strong, and every indication right now is that will be the case, we could leave that temporary capacity add online, which gives us kind of an incremental bump above where kind of we would be if it was just Whitewater and Trenton. So -- but the way we've sized the equipment and everything in the Trenton facility, we think we'll be ramping throughout the full year. And we'll will kind of hit the ground running here mid-year and hopefully be at kind of max rates by the end of the year. That would be the goal.
Philip Shen: Okay. Thanks, Aaron. And then embedded in your guidance.
Operator: Next question, Tommy Moll from Stephens.
Tommy Moll: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.
Aaron Jagdfeld: No problem, Tommy, apologies to Phil.
York Ragen: We'll follow up.
Tommy Moll: It happened to me last quarter, so I guess it's where we are these days. Lots of interest in the call. I'll get I'll get to the questions here. So I wanted to talk about some of the demand dynamics you've seen around the Home as a Sanctuary theme. Have you discerned anything different in terms of the demographics or anything you pick up on the types of customers whose leads you're qualifying or maybe through channel conversations? You've commented that it's a much broader swell of demand geographically, so many more states for example, so that -- it's clear that that's changed. I just wonder for years and years you've had a pretty, pretty good insight into the types of folks who are interested in your products demographic wise. And I just wonder if you're seeing any shifts there as a part of this trend.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, it's a great question, Tommy, We do a ton of work around the demographics of the customer bases that buy those products over the years. It's just as the leader in that category and as building it out, we had to develop the market, so understanding who the buyer was and where the opportunities were. And frankly, one of the things we learned in that is understanding who the buyer wasn't, right. So who wasn't buying the products and why? Who went through the sale process and didn't buy and why didn't they buy? Those are all important considerations. And to answer your question though, demographically typically the product category historically has skewed older, right. So something on the order of 70% of the customers have been over age 50 historically, and that's really because home ownership kind of follows those trends. We have seen indications early in the pandemic, what we saw, and it's a little bit dicey when we talk about this because you have to talk about that expansion in the geography. As an example, Florida was such a hot market last year for us. And it just, it typically demographically is an older market. So we actually saw our demo shift older, but when you strip out Florida, actually the demo for other states was shifting younger, which is really fascinating. I think what it speaks to, Florida was an interesting dynamic because you had a lot of people who went down over the winter last year. The pandemic started to take hold February and March. They chose to kind of shelter in place and stay in Florida. If they didn't own a generator, they came to the conclusion very quickly they needed one because they were going to be basically stuck in Florida. And they started to get worried about something that if you're not living there, you don't worry about over the summer, which is the hurricane season. So, we saw marked interest in Florida by that market, and that led to kind of a skew towards older. But everywhere else it was younger. And so what we're seeing is younger families, in particular people who are moving out of cities, metro areas, and into homes, and again they're working from home now, in particular. They're not driving back into the city to go into an office. They're staying in their home. And so they start to connect the dots, and maybe they experience their first outage in their new home, and they figure out very quickly just how vulnerable they are. You hear us use this term power security. We started introducing in the terminology here, and it's not an unfamiliar term for those around the industry, but this idea of making sure that you've got a continuous source of power to protect your home, your family, your livelihood is I think -- is really resonating across certainly across geographies, as we talked, but demographically I think it's resonating in particular with people who are shifting to that work from home model and learn from home model.
Tommy Moll: That's very helpful context and much appreciated. I want to ask a follow-up on a different theme here around the potential to go build out some virtual power plants now that you've got Enbala under the portfolio -- in the portfolio. And specifically you made some comments around the potential to enroll natural gas generators, whether they'd be on the resi or the C&I side, into that kind of platform. And what is the -- what is the potential ramp there look like here in North America. Maybe because you have such great market share on the resi side, not many others have talked about that concept, but it sounds like you have some product innovation in the pipeline that may enable it. And so, I'm curious what the opportunity set looks like.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, it's something that as part of the thesis behind the acquisition of Enbala was that obviously we make, we make a lot of products that could be used as distributed energy resources, right. So we have $2 million home standby generators on the ground. We have literally hundreds of megawatts of C&I products that we put into the market every year. It's actually, if you step back and you think of the potential, and I called it out in the prepared remarks, and we think we're in this incredibly unique position given the scale that we can bring to this with the assets that we already, not only that we already have on the ground, but certainly that we put into the market on a year-in and year-out basis. And those assets combined now with the technology, which is Enbala, the Concerto platform is the enablement of those assets to be used in a much more fulsome way right, to the benefit of the end users, grid operators, utility companies, ourselves, right, Generac. I mean there is an opportunity for us to participate in that. We haven't given really clear kind of longer range guidance on this yet, because we're trying to get our arms around just what are the different business models that are out there and available to us, and there are a lot of them. I talked about few of them in the script here today, but there is a lot of different ways we could play this. I think the opportunity doesn't begin though until we get the products to be connected to the Enbala network, and that's what our effort is here in the early innings. So we just closed on this acquisition in really the beginning of Q4 in October. So we've been diligently working on our roadmaps to make sure we can take our existing residential generators, our existing C&I generators, our existing PWRcell storage devices and then some of our newer load management products that I talked about on the call today. We're going to make all of those what we refer to as Enbala ready. And by doing that, in effect, we have an asset that can be much more strongly positioned with a much higher value proposition for an end-user, beyond -- well beyond just emergency standby in the case of our legacy products. And so again, I'm not answering your question directly only because we're still kind of working through how do we want to speak to this, what is the potential, how easy or hard will it be to monetize that potential, right? And then what does that monetization look like for us specifically? So, I think in the end one thing we are convinced about is, we're going to able to sell more assets, right. I mean the assets we sell today -- we're selling a lot of assets today, primarily on the premise of emergency backup. If now those assets could be deployed as part of a virtual power plant or distributed grid and they have much more utility and value, suddenly you take an asset like a home standby that doesn't have a payback for a homeowner. That's not why a homeowner buys it. And you turn into something that could provide a payback for that homeowner, if the generator were to be switched on by the Enbala network, by a grid operator or an energy retailer several times a year, several hours a year, for the benefit of reducing the premium they pay on the open market when there are supply-demand imbalances on the grid. So it is a super exciting area for us and more to come. More to come from us on that and really looking forward to again our unique position with grid services.
Operator: Next question, Philip Shen from ROTH Capital.
Philip Shen: Okay. Thanks for taking me back. Yes, so I'll just ask one more and pass it on. But as it relates to the guidance, and I think you guys in terms of clean energy last year, you did $115 million in revenue for clean energy. And I think you said that you expect that to be 50% to 75% higher in '21. So just wanted to make sure that roughly $185 million to $190 million of revenue at a midpoint for clean energy in '21. And then, as a kind of another topic there, maybe finish that up, and I'll come back and follow-up on clean energy. Sorry.
York Ragen: Yes, I know that, I mean basically you confirmed what we said in our prepared remarks. We saw a large ramp in Q4, up 75% from Q3, and that momentum is going to continue into this year. And with the positive things we're seeing, we're showing -- we're talking 50% or 75% increase in '21 versus 2020.
Philip Shen: Great. And we've heard some logistical issues on the storage side as you guys are ramping up and growing this business. Some of it has to do with ports and congestion and maybe certain installers when they getting their goods. I mean maybe they get the battery, but they don't get the Optimizer, they don't get the SnapRS or something. So can you talk about when you expect to resolve that friction if you will, and is that maybe limiting some of the growth. And in fact once you solve that, do you think the growth could perhaps even accelerate?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Phil. We think that those are largely behind us. We had some constraints as you mentioned, logistics mainly. For a while there, we were flying pieces and parts over the top of boats on the West Coast ports. We've got a full inventory position now and everything we need. And we think that that's going to be -- going to give us a good start here to 2021. And it's certainly an important part of getting to that 50% to 75% growth rate that we're quoting for our expectations next year. So -- but supply chain is a constraint. It's a concern, a challenge. I would imagine for most companies right now like ours it's -- every day is a new battle with something right. I mean it's just it's hand to hand combat right now down in the trenches on trying to get pieces and parts from the supply chain, all the way through into our warehouses and in the hands of our customers. So -- but the particular things you're mentioning there we've got behind us.
Operator: Next question, Ross Gilardi from Bank of America.
Ross Gilardi: Good morning, guys. We're running out of superlatives for Generac on your performance. Congratulations.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks.
Ross Gilardi: Can you speak at all to the size of the backlog for us or if you don't want to say the absolute number, just some sense of like how it compares to when you were exiting 2012 on the back of Sandy? And I'm just trying to get a better sense of the production versus the retail trends in home standby as they unfold in 2020. It's hard to believe that as strong as the category has been with you guys running above capacity that you've actually under produced demand so materially, but just trying to understand those dynamics a little better.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, I'm right alongside you on that one, Ross. We have been making some major investments in our Whitewater facility where -- which has been the primary center of gravity for manufacturing of those products. And those are investments, multi-year, multi-tens of millions of dollars that we've been putting in that facility to ramp production there. And honestly, we came into this year. We've put a bunch of automation in that facility early in the year well before the pandemic hit. So we thought we were in pretty good shape. And then the demand curve has just been, I -- you talk about the loss of words and superlatives. Mike's running out of things in the thesaurus here -- every time we write these prepared remarks, we're trying to figure out how else to describe what we're seeing, because it's -- it is -- it's really something. And I guess, while we're not quoting a distinct number, I'll just get to the heart of it. At the end of the year, I think we said -- in the Q3 call, we said our lead times on home standby generators were between 16 to 20 week. So pick the midpoint on that. It's about 18 weeks as kind of where we exited the year at if you ordered one. It was 18 weeks out. Today, we stand at about 20 weeks. So it's actually gone the wrong way on us. And that's -- again we're at all-time daily records we're hitting every day at our facility there. That Trenton facility can't come online fast enough. It's -- I wish we had a better answer for people. Our customers are really patient. I think the one thing that -- the one saving grace if there is one here is, this is a home improvement project. So people are somewhat acclimated to home improvement projects generally taking a long time. There is permitting involved, there's inspections involved. It's not just a kind of a one and done deal where you have something you order and then it gets shipped to your house. This is -- there's contractors involved and other authorities and jurisdictional authorities and things like that. So, I think -- I'm not trying to say we have some cover for the longer lead times, but they get accepted to a degree. Lead times are long, but we don't see a ton of cancellations, it's very sticky backlog. To answer your question about as compared to when we exited 2012 into 2013, after Sandy. It's orders of magnitude higher, hundreds of millions. And it's a huge number. You can do some of the back of the envelope math if you look at our HSB kind of pacing in Q4, and you kind of think about our normal lead times of one to two weeks and being out 18 at the end of the year and then that growing another two weeks. You can kind of model that out and probably arrive at some -- a range there of some thoughts on what the backlog might look like, but it's not an English word, but ginormous is one of the words we can use to describe it.
Ross Gilardi: All right. Good enough. And then can you talk a little bit more about the profitability in your clean energy business and with PWRcell? You mentioned that you were profitable. I think that was an EBITDA comment, but I wanted to clarify that. And can you talk at all about the gross margins for your clean energy business, where roughly will they be by the end of 2021 in comparison to your overall gross margin? And just how should we think of it more on a two to three-year basis as you continue to ramp?
York Ragen: Yes, Ross. It's York. So yes, making very good progress on gross margin optimization. A lot of focus on the bill of material, a lot of focus on supply chain. And you're right, leaving the year here in 2020, in Q4, we were profitable. That was a nice landmark or a milestone for the start-up business being profitable in Q4. But throughout 2021, we do expect to ramp up our gross margins to somewhere in the mid-30% range. So that's relative -- what did we do almost 40%, well, I guess, high 30s here gross margin for 2020, so close to the Company average by the end of '21 is the plan. And then obviously we're going to be ramping up on our operating expenses to really go fast after this market. So expecting EBITDA margins to grow throughout the year as well, along with gross margins maybe hitting double digits there by the end of the year for EBITDA margins.
Operator: Next question, Mike Halloran from Baird.
Mike Halloran: Hey, good morning everyone. Let's stay on the clean energy side, maybe just an update on how distributor penetration. I know, Aaron, you made some in the prepared -- comments on the prepared remarks, but more importantly just some thoughts on the competitive dynamics, how you think the receptivity of your product in the marketplace is comparing to others? Obviously very strong demand holistically. So more curious on the relative side for you and how you think that's tracking versus what your hopes were?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Mike. So making really good progress on the distribution front, that's your question. I think in the prepared remarks we said like, we've trained over 4,200 energy -- we call them contractors. We sell kind of in a multiple of ways there into the channels. We two step through electrical wholesalers -- clean energy electrical wholesalers. And we also sell in some cases direct to a large national partners like Sunnova, who is one of our partners, a great partner of ours. And then, we serve a number of other kind of larger independent kind of long tail energy, clean energy companies directly. So really made good progress though. And it's been -- one thing we learned with the home standby business is you really got to have a lot of points of light, especially in something that's growing that's not as penetrated right. And certainly storage is a lot like the parallels there between home standby, in terms of the early days of home standby 20 years ago and what storage looks like today are eerily similar, super low penetration rates, super low awareness, pretty expensive, kind of lacked kind of availability in terms of where you could access the product, market access. So we know, we knew the roadmap, we had to take to change that. So we've been really focused heavily on that here. And I think our sales and marketing efforts, the efforts to put together sales processes for these channel partners and path leads to them, right. I mean one of their barriers to growth has always been customer acquisition costs, and here we are giving our channel partner leads for free. We're paying when -- they're not free of course, we're spending millions and millions on advertising to drive the leads into our hands, but we're giving them to our channel partners, so that they can see -- so they can have success. Because if they have success, we have success, it's a symbiotic relationship. So again, I don't know if I'm getting to the heart of your question, but really focused on building out that distribution network.
Mike Halloran: So, more I think along the lines of when you think about what you're doing in the market. Everyone is growing. Do you think you're getting your fair share, more than your fair share? And how do you think the competitive offering stacks up?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, so I think one thing that we've done is we're basically going to market from a differentiated standpoint. The way we differentiate is we focus on whole home back up, whole home power capability, right. So we have a largest inverter in the industry, which allows for more to be connected to the system at any one point in time, right. So people we compete with have smaller inverters and therefore the capacity constraints that are -- that manifest as a result of that mean that you can't take everything in your home and try and run it at the same time. There's just serious limitations to that if you have a smaller inverter. It's one of the reasons we really like the Pika energy system is it had a very high capacity inverter, and also the battery cabinets and the battery capacity, we believe we have one of the largest capacity availabilities in the industry. So you get longer duration then. If the outage lasts more than four hours, eight hours, you start to run into trouble, but we definitely can do quite a bit with the current size of the system. So that's how we differentiate. Are we getting our fair share? I think so. I mean we're growing very quickly. You can look at growth rates from others who are in this industry and how they describe their own growth in Q4 in clean energy and in particular around storage, right, if we just want to focus on that. And I would say our 75% growth rate is best in class, at least for those companies that have talked about it openly. So we feel like we're making good headway. We feel like we're building the brand and the space there, adding the distribution. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we've got a huge pipeline of really cool new stuff coming that I think it's going to only continue to separate us from the pack here as the market grows.
Operator: Next question, Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Hey, good morning guys. Most of questions have been asked. Just wanted to kind of go into the splits first half, second half, 48, 52. How should we think about the residential and the C&I relative to that 48, 52? Do they both kind of track that? And part of the impetus for the question is you've talked about Trenton hitting kind of max capacity later in the year in the second half. It sounded like you were talking about actual utilization, not just its ability to be online.
York Ragen: Yes. And I think that the first part of your question is, I would say that both Resi, C&I would probably follow similar trends in that 48-52. And I don't know if your second question was around that the 75% increase in capacity. That's a capacity number, it doesn't necessarily mean that's where we'll be at in the building by the end of the year. But we haven't given that number out, like…
Aaron Jagdfeld: Well, we hope to have the capability to be at full utilization by the end of the year should we need it.
York Ragen: Yes, that's a good point.
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think that's the answers to the question.
York Ragen: It's a good point.
Operator: Next question, Jed Dorsheimer from Canaccord Genuity.
Jed Dorsheimer: Hey, thanks, guys. Yes, great job, all the way around. So, Aaron, just if I think about resiliency and efficiency. I think most people and investors tend to think, well both are positives, but many don't realize that you're diametrically opposed between resiliency and efficiency. So as you think about the business and kind of climbing that efficiency, but also where there is freely available resilience sort of that parabolic curve, if you will. If we think about Home as a Sanctuary, it seems like we're sort of in that first order which is I've got a rolling blackout and so -- or I've got a storm or fire that hit. And so I don't want that to happen again. So I want to make my home more resilient. But when you think broader, sort of away from the coast, and you look at the policy that's being pushed out right now in terms of the -- for decarbonization. It seems like there is a much bigger play here in terms of that, that discussion along resiliency and efficiency where even these great results are kind of first inning type stuff. I'm just curious how you're thinking about that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Absolutely, Jed. I mean, when you look at, I would take our -- let's start with our legacy business, right, which we've been focused on for over 60 years, and it's about emergency backup. And an emergency backup system is, frankly, it's about cost. It's about first piece cost and what that system is capable of in terms of output, right. And so efficiency, rarely if ever, comes into the consideration for a homeowner or even a business owner for that matter. What's the cost of the system? What is my potential loss during an outage and how long could I run if I needed to, right? And so the efficiency was never really a consideration. Of course, we are concerned about things like that. In fact, I might point out one of the reasons we've been able to successively go larger with like our air cooled solution as an example -- we introduced the 24 KW air-cooled unit, is because we did focus on efficiency, right. We looked at the internal workings of the machine itself, both at the engine and at the alternator and made some design changes that allowed us to get a more efficient connected output to convert the mechanical energy to electrical. So that was an example where it's allowed us to position with the industry's leading product line. Now thinking forward, you're right. As you think about a distributed energy network or you think of the Grid 2.0 or 3.0, depending on your viewpoints on what you want to call it. I think that the new grid, this changing energy landscape, it's about a focus on decarbonizing, digitizing, right and decentralizing, right, the three Ds of that transition and that transformation that's underway. And so efficiency does play an important role there. But that being said, I think that the ability though to take an asset, which was primarily viewed only in the context of resiliency and for an emergency duty, and to use it more frequently, for peak times, right. If you want to think about peak times, there is a significant benefit to that when you think about that machine's usefulness over its life, right. So, as it sits there today, a machine delivered for emergency backup only will run a very limited amount of time in its life. That machine is fully capable of running much more. But unless it's called upon it doesn't. And so -- but with the Enbala platform, and with the idea of expanding grid services, it could be put into that type of mode. And that is a -- that's an exciting advancement as we talked on the prepared remarks and then on some of the Q&A. And I think we are very early in the innings in this transformation. And as I said before, I think one of the really interesting things as we look across what's going on in our business today, all the demand for home standby is about resiliency, primarily right. And so most of those customers who are buying home standby today or clamouring for one, really aren't even thinking about that that could be used in a different way. We're going to be educating people that it could. And I think that's going to open up even more opportunity and potential with the category, those existing categories, the legacy products. And that's what makes it so exciting I think, because again we just, we think that the added value prop, the improved value prop of those products is going to help us sell a lot more of them. So, I think that's why when you think about where this is going and our unique position as the asset manufacturer coming at this, right. I think a lot of others in this industry that we're competing against have come at it from maybe the software aspect or maybe the clean energy aspect. We're coming at it from an asset production aspect. And we're saying let's enable those assets to do a lot more because we know they can. And by the way, the majority of those assets, they're natural gas fired. So they're very clean in terms of the overall carbon footprint. So it's just -- we think it's just a really good -- good setup.
Operator: Last question, Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning everyone. Aaron, I'm wondering if you could talk about the backwards compatible nature of the Wi-Fi connected assets that you have in the field now. So going forward into this future vision of the grid that you folks laid out, will you be able to take the gen sets that are being installed today, that are Wi-Fi connected and connect them to the Enbala network? Could you talk about that? And separately, I'm wondering if you can talk about the pipeline that you have in sign-ups of new points of light, if you will, for your PWRcell distribution? Can you just quantify what that pipeline looks like for you? How many points of light do you think you're adding per month at this point?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So we talk about Power partners, and again because we're selling in some cases two step right. So we're selling to the contractors. They're selling to clean energy, part of your question, Jerry. That really is, it's about -- I think, we're at 700. And we've got a bunch of them in the pipeline as well.
York Ragen: They're using our CE lead-gen system.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Correct, correct. And then the first part of your question on the connectability. So we've got 2 million home standbys in the field. I'll just focus on residential, because I think it's a little bit easier to get our arms around the answer to the question. And frankly, the numbers are just big. Two million machines that we've put out in the field over the last, call it 20 years to 25 years. Starting with the products in 2008, those versions of products, those are connectable through our Wi-Fi solutions. Starting in, I think it was 2018, they began coming out of the box as standard with Wi-Fi connectability. But the 10 years of product -- the generation of product previous to that you can buy a device from us, an accessory device to make those connectable. That represents about 1.5 million of the 2 million going from 2008 forward. So think about in terms of ease of connectability, you can still connect the previous generation products, the 500,000 that are out there. It's just a little bit harder. The software and the hardware is a little more complicated. Those machines are older and not as quite -- obviously, they've been out in the market for some time, anything pre-2008. These machines have a lifecycle of 15 to 20 years. So, now just taking this one step further. What we have on our Wi-Fi and cellular platforms today is about a quarter million machines that are actively talking to us every day. So I think that's pretty exciting, when you just think of the scale of that, a quarter million since really 2018, the number of machines that are out there. That is pretty meaningful. We haven't really talked about that. So it's kind of an important data point that we haven't given before, but -- and it's rapidly growing. And we have, there are subscription revenues to some of the services. We do it -- some of them are sold through our channel partners. We call them fleet subscriptions. Some of them are just consumer subscriptions. It's actually a pretty cool business, and it's growing quite nicely. But what's really important about that is, those machines, those quarter of a million machines, for the most part, you're just talking about a software update, right. And all of those machines today, by the way, everything that's been coming out standard since 2018, you can do over the air updates with the firmware and software, which is awesome. So any new features like the Enbala platform, we can send it across the airwaves as an update to that equipment. So that's pretty powerful stuff. It's not unlike what you're hearing from others out there in different industries. We have that capability. We thought that, that was going to be really important for us to make sure that was in the technology roadmap here and the technology stack, and it is. So anyway, kind of bringing it to closure though. This is actively ramping. There's a lot of machines out there that we're getting data from and that we can enroll in those platforms. And then going forward, the roadmap, we want to make Enbala standard much the same as we made Wi-Fi connectable technology standard in 2018. We believe that every machine by the end of this year, every home standby shipping will have -- it will be Enbala-ready if you will, and our storage devices as well.
Operator: There are no further questions. Mike Harris, do you have any closing comments?
Mike Harris: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2021 earnings results with you in late April. Thank you again, and goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 Generac Holdings Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Harris, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Mike Harris: Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer, and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today’s call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable US GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release or SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to discuss our financial results reported earlier this morning, in which net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were all by far, all-time records for Generac. Third quarter revenue easily exceeded our prior forecast, and adjusted EBITDA margins were also well ahead of the previous guidance. Power outage activity was dramatically higher during the quarter as a result of a record Atlantic hurricane season, a severe wind event in the Midwest and high heat and growing wildfire risks in the western U.S., which led to higher shipments of both portable and standby generators, as well as aftermarket service parts. The extreme level of power outages, combined with the continuation of the home as a sanctuary trend led to unprecedented levels of demand for home standby generators during the quarter that was broadly based across the entire U.S. We are aggressively ramping production levels for home standby generators, and there is a substantial backlog for these products that continues to grow during the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, overall net sales increased approximately 16% on a core growth basis as compared to the strong prior year quarter. Dramatic growth in sales of home standby and portable generators, coupled with shipments for the recently launched PowerCell Energy Storage system, drove the net sales increase in the quarter. Very strong growth in aftermarket service parts and shore products also contributed to the revenue increase compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting this significant strength was a decline in shipments of C&I products. Gross margin expanded 320 basis points compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 450 basis points over the prior year to 25.5%, both of which were the highest margins reported since the fourth quarter of 2013. Before discussing third quarter results in more detail, I'd like to stress that as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, a high degree of uncertainty still remains regarding potential additional waves of the virus, the magnitude and timing of an economic recovery and the potential additional impacts on our end markets and overall business. However, as we have previously commented, our historical performance has repeatedly shown that demand for residential products can decouple from broader macroeconomic trends. And this has certainly proven to be the case during 2020. The combination of the dramatically higher power outage environment, along with the increasing trend of home as a sanctuary, is leading to a further increase in our full year revenue and earnings outlook for 2020, including higher expectations for the fourth quarter compared to our prior guidance. We'll provide further details regarding this updated guidance in the outlook portion of our prepared remarks this morning. Now discussing our third quarter results in more detail. Several key metrics that we monitor closely for home standby demand continued to be exceptionally strong during the quarter. Activations once again grew at a very substantial rate compared to the prior year, with broad-based strength across all U.S. regions and Canada. This strength was led by robust growth in the Western U.S. driven by California and very strong double-digit increases in the South Central, Southeast, and Northeast regions. The combination of in-home and virtual consultations once again rose during the third quarter in every single state in the contiguous U.S., with the majority of the states showing triple-digit growth, which we believe provides further support for the emerging home as a sanctuary trend. The power outage severity environment also continues to be favorable and trend well above the long-term baseline average in recent years. The significant outage activity was broad-based across the major regions of the U.S. and included a major event in Hurricane ESA [ph] which drove significant demand in the key Northeast region. We also ended the third quarter with over 7,000 residential dealers, an increase of approximately 800 or 13% over the last 12 months. This includes a significant increase in California ramping up to approximately 550 dealers at the end of the quarter, which is roughly 300 dealers higher as compared to the end of the prior year third quarter. More recently, early in the fourth quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to be much higher relative to prior year levels. Recall that we previously discussed trends with home consultations that were up approximately double versus the prior year and this tremendous strength has continued through October. We believe this increase can be attributed to several factors. The emerging trend of Americans viewing their homes as a sanctuary, the extreme level of outage activity during the third quarter and overall elevated baseline outages over the past several quarters, the active wildfire season in rolling blackouts in California, and the increasing awareness of the need for backup power. With demand for home standby generators at an all-time high, we've been working to aggressively ramp our supply chain and production levels and we achieved record daily build rates by the end of the third quarter. We continue to further ramp production levels for these products during the fourth quarter to significantly increase build rates well above previous peak levels and we are evaluating plans to put additional permanent capacity in place early in the second half of 2021. Despite our operations teams working around the clock to ramp up standby production as quickly as possible, the unprecedented strength and demand seen over the past several months has led to extended lead-times for these products. We had a substantial backlog for home standby generators at the end of the third quarter, which continues to grow during the fourth quarter, and we expect to enter 2021 with a very high level of open orders for these products, far exceeding anything previously experienced. Recall that Generac created the home standby category over two decades ago and the market continues to significantly expand, with every 1% of penetration, representing approximately $2.5 billion of additional market opportunity at retail prices. Despite the unprecedented home standby activity being experienced during 2020 in the form of home consultations, orders, build rates, activations, and net new dealers, the reality is that the overall penetration rate for the product category is only expected to be slightly over 5% at the end of the year. With demand for home standby generates being uniquely aligned with some key megatrends and secular growth drivers, we believe there remains considerable room for this dynamic market to continue to grow over the next several years. Also benefiting from the continuation of the home-as-a-sanctuary trend, we experienced strong growth for our core products during the quarter. Recall that chore products consists of a wide range of specialty outdoor power equipment, including field and brush mowers, chipper shredders, log splitters, stump grinders, and pressure washers and are used in a variety of property maintenance applications. The strength experienced during the quarter included the sale of these products directly to consumers as homeowners increased outdoor project activity while spending more time at home. And so far, in the fourth quarter, demand continues to outpace normal seasonality. In September, we further expanded our broad lineup of chore products by entering the battery-powered commercial mower market through acquiring the assets of Mean Green products. Based in Ross, Ohio, Mean Green is a leading manufacturer of an innovative line of commercial zero-turn and walk-behind, battery-powered turf care products. Importantly, this equipment provides quiet operation, zero emissions and minimal maintenance requirements as compared to traditional commercial mowers. The acquisition will support our goals to integrate and develop new battery-powered solutions by accelerating the electrification of our lineup of higher powered Chore Products. Rounding out our discussion on residential products is an update on clean energy. The secular growth opportunity within the U.S. market for energy storage and monitoring systems remains very compelling. Particularly around the increasing resiliency desired from these products, which is driving residential solar attachment rates that are currently approaching 30%. Shipments of our PWRcell Energy Storage Systems recovered as expected during the quarter, and we're a key contributor to the company's year-over-year growth, and we are expecting a further significant sequential increase in shipments during the fourth quarter. We are making important strides in growing the still nascent market for energy storage, through targeted advertising, lead generation and sales capabilities, along with expanding our distribution capabilities, including our strategic partnership with Sonova. Our new clean energy infomercial began airing earlier this year and continues to drive good volume into our lead management and selling system that we call PowerPlay CE. We are very encouraged by the trends with home consultations for PWRcel Systems as they accelerated during the third quarter and have continued to be strong so far in the fourth quarter. System activations, which are a proxy for installations and commissioning, have also improved notably in recent months as compared to the second quarter, providing further proof of the V-shaped recovery for the clean energy market. We have made tremendous progress in ramping our clean energy products from essentially a start-up in 2019 to year one revenues for 2020, which are expected to be in line with our previous guidance. And which are far ahead of the expectations we laid out at our Investor Day last September. We achieved profitability for these products during the month of September and were roughly breakeven during the quarter, and we were expecting to achieve our first full quarter of profitability in Q4. We have accomplished this by significantly advancing our capabilities with our supply chain through increased volume and reduced system costs. We have also had several important new product introductions in 2020, and we continue to develop an innovative pipeline of additional clean energy products that will be coming to market over the next several quarters. We believe this will further enhance our competitive position and differentiation in the energy storage, monitoring and management markets as we focus on whole house storage solutions with load management capabilities that provide the energy independence, we believe consumers really want in these systems. We remain extremely excited about the long-term growth opportunity for our clean energy products, including the potential to leverage and combine our new clean energy capabilities with our core competencies and strategies around our legacy natural gas generators. We believe this will better enable us to enter new and adjacent markets that align with the evolving megatrend around Grid 2.0, which is the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model, including decentralization of the grid and a migration towards distributed energy resources. To help accelerate our involvement with this trend, earlier this month, we closed on the acquisition of Enbala Power Networks, a leading distributed energy resources technology company based in Denver, Colorado. Enbala's best-in-class technology will enable us to participate in the market for grid services, which we see as a growing opportunity. The company's can share to a cloud-based platform is being used by utilities and energy retailers to leverage the power of distributed energy resources to respond to the real-time energy balancing needs of power systems and energy markets. Distributed Energy Resources, known as DERs, and our assets or systems that can generate, store or manage power, such as our residential or C&I natural gas generators, our PWRcel Energy storage systems and our devices that enable load management. In areas where grid stability is needed, these DER assets can be connected to Enbala's software platform and can be aggregated into a decentralized and virtual power network to provide flexible capacity to address peaks in electricity supply and demand. Importantly, Enbala has an open software platform that is both brand and equipment agnostic, providing the capability to connect to a wide range of assets or systems. The platform is currently being used in areas around the world where the increasing use of renewables is creating more variability in supply and where resiliency is needed as a result of power outages. A recent ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, known as FERC 2222 and is a timely development for Enbala as it mandates utilities create programs that allow DERs to participate in the wholesale electric market. We believe this ruling will serve to accelerate the overall move towards a decentralized grid by providing a path to connect and monetize both legacy and new DERs. This could result in opportunities to leverage the existing installed base of natural gas generators and energy storage systems by connecting them to software platforms such as Enbala's, thereby turning them into much more productive assets. Enbala is an important acquisition for us as we continue our evolution from an equipment manufacturer to an energy technology solutions company. Now with regards to our C&I products, as expected, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to have a significant adverse impact on the overall market for global power generation and related equipment, given major declines in GDP growth rates around the globe. Domestic shipments have seen a decline during the third quarter as compared to the prior year, but came in ahead of our expectations. While there remains some uncertainty relative to the pandemic and although we still expect shipments for domestic C&I products to decline on a year-over-year basis during the fourth quarter that the magnitude of the declines are slowing. As expected shipments of mobile products and national rental account customers declined significantly during the quarter, primarily due to the continued impact of the pandemic and lower oil prices. Demand for mobile equipment had already begun to soften as we entered 2020, with many of our national rental customers, reducing their capital spending budgets for the year. But the sudden decline in economic activity and corresponding drop in fleet utilization that occurred in March, forced them to further and dramatically reduce equipment purchases. As we are expecting continued demand headwinds for domestic mobile products in the near-term, we have focused our efforts on cost reductions and other restructuring actions, which we began implementing in the second quarter. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for mobile products as an expected fleet replacement cycle nears and the compelling mega trend around an infrastructure improvement, which could be aided over the next couple of years by economic stimulus. Shipments to national telecom customers also declined on a year-over-year basis, but we're also ahead of our prior expectations. More recently, we are seeing indications from several of our large telecom customers of an improving outlook and we are now expecting overall shipments to grow in the fourth quarter as compared to the relatively soft prior year comparison. Recall the demand trends for these customers can vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of their capital spending and their project planning cycles. Historically however, demand for telecom backup power tends to increase after periods of elevated power outage activity, similar to what we experienced during the third quarter. In addition, the California Public Utility Commission in July passed the mandate requiring a minimum of 72 hours of backup power at all cell tower locations in the state, which is expected to be implemented over the next three years, beginning in 2021. We've been in contact with the wireless operators in California to better understand the market opportunity and to gain better insights into their network spending plans related to this new mandate. While we're still in the early stages of understanding the impact, we currently estimate the backup power opportunity to state could range between $100 million to $200 million over the next three years beginning next year. The incremental demand for Generac will depend on whether or not existing capital spending by the carriers is reallocated to California from other regions in order to meet the requirements of this new mandate. Lastly, shipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel were also lower in the quarter, but the decline was less than expected. While this channel initially experienced a large decline in quotations for new projects in March and April, during the onset of the pandemic, project quoting activity has largely recovered since then, which has improved the overall order outlook for this channel. We also continue to experience encouraging growth trends for natural gas generators, particularly in the higher kilowatt ranges as we begin selling into applications beyond emergency standby power. Additionally, results for our C&I products now include the acquisition of Energy Systems. Our industrial distributor located in Northern California, on which we closed the acquisition on July 1st. This acquisition expands our presence in the rapidly growing California market and enhances our ability to serve one of the largest power generation markets in the U.S. for both C&I and residential products. The ongoing global pandemic continued to have a significant impact on C&I product demand outside the U.S. and Canada during the third quarter as well. As GDP growth rates have been sharply reduced around the world, revenues for our international segment in the third quarter declined approximately 12% on a core basis when compared to the prior year. This decline was broad-based across numerous markets and further magnified the slower economic growth and geopolitical headwinds that were already being felt prior to pandemic. Despite this weakness and uncertainty in the global market, overall international revenue during the third quarter was modestly ahead of our expectations. And our current full year outlook is now more favorable for this segment as certain regions are trending better than previously feared. Importantly, despite the decline in revenue during the quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins for our international segments still expanded 310 basis points to 7.9%, primarily due to lower operating expenses as a result of the restructuring activities that we initiated during the second quarter. Similar to our domestic C&I products, we believe international shipments will continue to decline on a year-over-year basis during Q4, but with the magnitude of the decline slowing relative to recent quarters. Our international teams remain focused on several critical global initiatives around increasing the penetration of natural gas generators for residential and C&I applications, expanding our share globally in the important wireless telecom backup power segment and entering the emergency – the emerging energy storage market for both residential and C&I applications. In closing, this morning, I'm extremely proud of our team as we are on pace for another year of record financial results, including more than 10% core revenue growth. This is only made possible by the tireless execution of our 6,500 employees globally across the company, which has been even more difficult this year in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generac continues to benefit from a number of megatrends and macro secular themes. In fact, we believe these trends and themes are more compelling today are more compelling today than they've ever been, when considering the emergence of the new home as a sanctuary trend, the effects of extreme weather driving continued power outage activity and the company's increasing capabilities with clean energy products and grid services, which is allowing us to participate in the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model. In addition, we're confident that once we get through this pandemic, our future growth prospects for our C&I products remain very compelling, driven by the increasing penetration of natural gas generators in a wide variety of applications, wireless telecommunications shifting to the 5G architecture and the major investment cycle needed for legacy infrastructure. Supplementing these powerful trends and drivers is our considerable financial strength, liquidity and free cash flow generation that puts us in the enviable position to aggressively invest further in a number of strategic initiatives to accelerate our powering our future strategy. As a result, we remain very excited about our long-term growth prospects and believe the future for Generac is brighter than it's ever been. I now want to turn the call over to York to provide further details on third quarter results and our updated outlook for 2020. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at third quarter 2020 results in more detail. Net sales increased 16.7% to $701.4 million during the third quarter of 2020, an all-time record as compared to $601.1 million in the prior year third quarter, which was our previous record. The combination of contributions from the energy systems and mean green acquisitions and favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 1% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the third quarter by product class, residential product sales during the third quarter increased 37% to $458.9 million as compared to $335 million in the prior year. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth, which was once again, nearly 30%. In addition to this home standby strength, there was a significant increase in shipments of portable generators during the quarter despite the very strong prior year comparison caused by Hurricane Dorian. Portable generator shipments were at record levels during the current year quarter, primarily as a result of the higher power outage activity, which included demand from Hurricane ECS. Also significantly contributing to year-over-year growth in residential products for shipments of our PowerCell Energy storage systems following the expected recovery in the solar market during the third quarter. Shipments of Chore products were also higher during the quarter as the home as a sanctuary trend positively impacted demand for outdoor power equipment. Commercial and industrial product net sales for the third quarter of 2020 declined 18% to $176.2 million as compared to $214.9 million in the prior year quarter with a core sales decline of approximately 19% when excluding the impacts from the Energy Systems acquisition and favorable foreign currency. The weakness in shipments of C&I products was broad-based, both domestically and internationally. Domestically, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic drove lower utilization of rental fleets, and as a result, our national rental account customers continue to defer capital spending for our C&I mobile products. In addition, shipments to our telecom national accounts continue to decline as key customers also took a pause in capital spending. Internationally, C&I products declined due to the continued broad-based sharp drop in global demand caused by the pandemic. Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue amortization and other service offerings increased 29.4% to $66.3 million as compared to $51.2 million in the third quarter of 2019. As Aaron mentioned, very strong growth, very strong growth was experienced in aftermarket service parts as a result of power outage activity being dramatically higher in the current year quarter. A larger and growing installed base of our products, higher levels of extended warranty revenue and the addition of Energy Systems also contributed to the increase versus the prior year. Gross profit margin improved 320 basis points to 39.4% compared to 36.2% in the prior year third quarter. Operating expenses increased $8.6 million or 7.6% as compared to the third quarter of 2019, but declined 130 basis points as a percentage of revenue, excluding intangible amortization. As a result, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $178.8 million or a very strong 25.5% of net sales, as compared to $126 million or 21% of net sales in the prior year. This 450 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by the impressive gross margin expansion during the quarter, primarily due to favorable sales mix. Improved leverage of fixed operating expenses on the much higher sales volumes and tight cost control. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two other segments. Domestic segment sales increased 22.6% to $606.9 million as compared to $494.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter was $171.4 million or 28.2% of net sales as compared to $120.8 million in the prior year or 24.4% of net sales. International segment sales, which consists primarily of C&I products, declined 11.1% to $94.5 million as compared to $106.3 million in the prior year quarter. Foreign currency had a net favorable impact of only 500 basis points on revenue growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter before deducting for noncontrolling interests was $7.4 million or 7.9% of net sales as compared to $5.1 million or 4.8% of net sales in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2020 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $115 million, as compared to $75.6 million in the third quarter of 2019. GAAP income taxes during the current year third quarter were $32.1 million or an effective tax rate of 21.8%, as compared to $20.1 million or an effective tax rate of 21.1%. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the prior year having more favorable discrete tax items compared to the current year quarter, which was partially offset by an overall more favorable mix of pretax income in the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was at $1.82 in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $1.18 in the prior year. The specific calculations for these earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release. Adjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release, was $132.9 million in the current year quarter or $2.08 per share, which was also an all-time record. This compares to an adjusted net income of $90 million in the prior year or $1.43 per share. Cash income taxes for the third quarter of 2020 were $23.6 million as compared to $15.1 million in the prior year quarter. The current year now reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 16% for the full year 2020, which is a reduction from the approximately 17% rate previously expected for 2020, and compares to the prior year expectation of approximately 17% at that time. The reduction in the current year cash tax rate from previous expectations was primarily due to favorable return to provision adjustments reflected in our recently filed corporate tax returns. Cash flow from operations was very strong at $155.2 million as compared to $111.2 million in the prior year third quarter. And free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was $148.3 million as compared to $100.8 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes and resulting net income. Before discussing our updated outlook for 2020, it's important to reiterate our healthy balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of the third quarter of 2020, which allows us to confidently operate our business and execute our strategy even during these uncertain times. As of September 30, 2020, we had $808 million of liquidity, comprised of $514 million of cash on hand and $294 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in June of 2023. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter was $890 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was only 1.7 times on an as-reported basis. In addition, our term loan matures in December 2026, and we do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date. Also recall, there are no financial covenants on the term loan, which has a low-cost of debt of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. Finally, we have interest rate swap arrangements that fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt to the maturity date on December 2026. Further enhancing our overall liquidity is our strong cash flow profile. And over the last 12 months ended September 30, 2020, cash flow from operations and free cash flow were impressive at $443 million and $397 million, respectively. Lastly, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we have significant resources to drive further shareholder value as we execute on our long-term strategic priorities, and our approach toward capital deployment remains disciplined, balanced and consistent. With that, I will now provide comments on our updated outlook for 2020. As a result of the higher power outage environment experienced thus far in the second half of 2020, along with the increased production rates for home standby generators expected in the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year 2020 guidance for full -- for revenue growth to approximately 10% to 12% versus the prior year. This compares to the previous baseline guidance of 5% to 8% growth and is now expected to be at the high end of our previous upside case scenario communicated last quarter when factoring in the additional 2% to 3% of revenue growth associated with a more severe outage environment. Net sales for residential products continues to outpace our expectations due to higher shipments of portable generators from the much higher power edge environment and aggressively ramping up our home standby generator production capacity to record levels. As a result, year-over-year growth for these products is now expected to be even more significant for the full year 2020 as compared to previous expectations, with the fourth quarter expected to increase sequentially compared to the third quarter. Another key driver to our increased revenue guidance is a higher level of shipments of aftermarket service parts as a result of the increase in power outage hours during the third quarter. Revenue growth for C&I products is still expected to be down significantly for the full year 2020 versus prior year, but is moderately better relative to prior guidance. And fourth quarter is also expected to increase sequentially compared to the third quarter. This overall guidance assumes no further deterioration from additional waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. We're also raising our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for the full year 2020 to be approximately 22.5% to 23%, which is an increase from the 21.5% to 22% previously expected. This improvement is driven by higher operating leverage and lower discretionary advertising and promotional costs, given the favorable demand environment. Operating and free cash flow generation for the full year 2020 is expected to remain strong with the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow still anticipated to be approximately 90%. Depreciation expense is forecast to be approximately $35 million in 2020 versus the $33 million to $34 million previously guided. In addition, share-based compensation expense is also expected to be slightly higher at $19 million to $20 million, compared to the $18 million to $19 million previously guided. The remaining guidance items provided in previous earnings calls are not expected to change. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Please be reminded that you can only ask one question and one follow-up. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Hayes from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Tom Hayes: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Tom.
York Ragen: Hi, Tom.
Tom Hayes: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit, maybe, about the Enbala acquisition. It sounds like a great piece to your complete solutions. So I'm just wondering, kind of, how you see that fitting into that solution set to how you take it to market, any other color you could provide would be great.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's a great question, Tom. And this is an acquisition that -- and it's a small company. It's another startup that we've added into our mix here of start-up companies that we've been acquiring. But we're really excited about Enbala. Enbala has -- and the name Enbala, it means literally, energy balance. So that's the connotation of the company's name. And it is an awesome team of people from the utility industry and people that are familiar with that industry, who have come through different start-ups and things in the past. But it's really aimed squarely at the idea of taking and leveraging not only our existing assets that we have in place like generally. We have over 2 million home standby generators on the ground as an example. And it represents just a pretty massive number in terms of megawatts available -- really, gigawatts available for potential use. Today, those generators sit largely unused, right? So, I mean, they operate when called upon, a couple of times a year, maybe, for a few hours a year, or longer depending on the region. But by and large, that becomes a somewhat underutilized asset. And we believe that Enbala, their platform -- it's a software company, so it's a technology play, that software platform can allow for the -- what they refer to in their lingo as enrolling an asset, like a generator or one of our power cell storage systems or even a load management device, enrolling that in their platform and allowing them to aggregate those assets and those systems for use by utilities or other grid operators. And the effective need there, the need case is really around places where you see grid power being augmented very heavily with renewables. So as you bring a lot of renewables into the supply side of the equation, you increased volatility. The variability of those renewables by their very nature, they're more volatile power sources than, say, a traditional combined cycle power plant. And as a result, grid operators have to deal with that. And they have to deal with the potential for the wind dropping off or as we saw West this summer, high heat, creating a situation where demand spiked and they also had some cloudier days than they were predicting. And so, less solar production to satisfy that demand. So the ability to turn on an add or augment to the grid, these kind of distributed or decentralized assets to help balance out those parts of the grid that required it, is a really exciting area that's going to grow rapidly in the years ahead. In particular, as renewable mandates mature, many states, if not all, states, have some level of a renewable mandate, some percentage, high percentage of total power generation to come from renewables in future years. And so we see Enbala really enabling us to take the next logical step. Today, we've been – we're really a legacy equipment manufacturer and really a generator manufacturer and tomorrow, we see ourselves as much more of an energy technology solutions provider. And Enbala, I think, is a really key piece of technology and the talent that we acquired there is a really key piece of enabling us to step forward.
Tom Hayes: I appreciate the color. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Regarding the backlog of the home and standby unit. Just wondering if you could quantify, was there any impact to the Q3 revenue, if you guys just having such a backlog?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Well, the Q3 revenue was up dramatically. In fact, orders, we just look at home standby orders. They were about 2.5 times greater than they were the year before. So now – I mean, it was massive. I mean we've never seen anything like that. And it's obviously, as we talked in the prepared remarks, we've got quite a backlog that we ended the quarter with, and that's only continued to grow here in Q4. And we've been hitting record outputs in our production environment in spite of all the headwinds there with component challenges and manning challenges and everything around the pandemic that is making that difficult. We're achieving record outputs in Q4 here, we've actually brought some additional capacity online and another factory here in Wisconsin. I also mentioned in the prepared remarks this morning, we're in sight for our selection process for another facility, another permanent facility, really a full second site that will not quite double production for these products, but will increase production dramatically for home standby, probably coming online sometime mid next year and then obviously needing to ramp throughout the back half of the year. But that backlog is going to be at just eye-popping numbers here. Now the good news is this, I mean, their home improvement projects. So our experience historically is the demand is pretty sticky. Once we – an order comes in, a dealer takes a down payment or we start the process of getting permits and the dealer can also do some site type of preparatory work ahead of having to actually put the generator down, so there can be some trenching. There can be – the transfer switch might be able to be installed ahead of time. So we can keep the project moving. But lead times for these products are extended right now and probably will remain so for the foreseeable future.
Tom Hayes: Thanks. Appreciate the color.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jed Dorsheimer from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.
Jed Dorsheimer: Hi. Thanks and congrats on a fantastic quarter.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks.
Jed Dorsheimer: Two questions. First one, kind of a simple one. Lead times on the resi side. So you've expanded your dealer network. Lead times have gone from eight weeks to 16 weeks in many of those. So as you think about entering 2021, and I'm not asking for guidance, but it would seem – and I may have missed the backlog number, but it would seem like that backlog should seriously offset what we would expect to see in terms of normal seasonality? And then I have a follow-up question.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. That's exactly it, Jed. And in fact, if you go back to – the best thing I can point people to would be kind of after Hurricane Sandy. There were a couple of big storms, Sandy being the culmination of that, in 2011 and 2012 out in the Northeast grew our dealer base, grew our backlog. We exited 2012 with a massive backlog – at the time what we thought was a massive number. It will look small compared to wherever we land here with the backlog when we end the year. But it really did kind of – I don't want to say disrupt, but it disrupted the normal seasonality, the seasonal rhythms of the business when it comes to home standby. Normally, we would see, a cadence would be Q1 is typically the lowest quarter of the year for that category. Generally, it's more difficult to install during the colder winter months. And you just see demand kind of fall off. Weather patterns generally aren't as aggressive. It's not hurricane season, that kind of stuff. But because the backlog is going to be high, Q1 will be a bit more dependent on what kind of weather. If we have a really brutal winter, that may create a situation where they just can't get product installed until the ground thaws. But remember, we have a lot of demand that we're seeing in parts of the Southeast and South central regions and out West, where you really don't have a problem necessarily doing installations during the kind of January through March months. So you're absolutely right, though. It's going to really distort the normal seasonality in that business.
Jed Dorsheimer: Got it. And so just as a follow-up, completely separate topic. But as you mentioned the increase in the renewable, as well as that on the 26 kilowatt, for example, on the standby and the PowerView Home app that you have. I'm wondering if you could articulate the monetization plans around the increased level of data and intelligence that you're now going to be getting from a microgrid or a supply demand perspective that you may have. How should we think about that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean, it's super exciting, Jed, and I think it's really early innings in this game. The idea of taking an asset which here to or has really been viewed as it's basically insurance, right? I mean you buy a home standby generator because we want to protect your home, protect your family, from power outages. And so the decision for – in the residential market, in particular, has largely been -- I don't want to say it's all emotional, but there's not much of an ROI that you can ascribe to those products, right? I mean, you can say, okay, I won't throw away a freezer full of meat or food or I might not to stay a couple of nights in a hotel, and you might be able to -- maybe I get a break on my homeowners insurance policy because I have a home standby generator, which are programs that are gaining acceptance. But you'd be hard-pressed to kind of create a payback model there that works beyond anything that is really just peace of mind, right? I mean that's really what those products are. Going forward, though, and kind of what your question is leaning into, is the fact that I think these products can be sold in a different way. And really, we look to how we're selling our power cell, energy storage systems, right? The energy storage system, we went into that thinking it was more about the ROI and less about resiliency. And what we found actually is that, it's really all about resiliency and some about ROI. So we think that there's an opportunity. We think the resiliency is going to be a big theme, no matter what. Whether you're talking about battery storage or whether you're talking about generators. It's really going to -- it's going to depend on the use case and if you live in areas where longer duration outages are going to happen, a generator is probably still going to be the best play for you. But the idea of being able to monetize that generator further, I'd love to give you a crisp answer on here's exactly what we're thinking of. We're thinking it could be a PPA-type arrangement. The generator maybe its owned and operated by a third-party and the homeowner pays a monthly and gets a credit on their power bill, something like that. The truth of the matter is, I think it's going to take a lot of different formats. We're currently engaged with a number of utility companies, a number of grid operators, a number of kind of strategic partners that we're talking to about what should that model look like. And I think it will become clearer as the market develops and they're going to become clearer as maybe the incentive structures develop but I don't have like a solid -- this is exactly how you should think about monetizing that. I think as we get into 2021 and we do some guidance there, clearly, around the Enbala piece, that -- again, the revenues there are software related.
York Ragen: Enables us to do more things.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Exactly. And it's an enabler for us. And so as that enabler takes root, I think we'll probably have much crisper ideas and thoughts around how we intend to monetize it. What I like though, just largely, I think it gives us a platform on which to just sell more equipment based solely on the fact that it moves the product category, that being the legacy home standby category from this peace of mind insurance product to one that could be monetized further for the benefit of the homeowners either reduce their energy costs or somehow participate in a program -- a virtual power plant type of program.
York Ragen: Same thing for C&I.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. And same on C&I, correct.
Operator: We have our next question from the line of Philip Shen with ROTH Capital. Your line is open.
Philip Shen: Hey guys. Thanks for the questions.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey Phil.
Philip Shen: I wanted to dig in deeper on a couple of topics. First one, on the new site location, can you share when you think you'll finalize that decision as to where it might be? And where could it be, maybe the short list of where it might be? And then you talked about -- it's not quite a double, so I'm guessing kind of in that 70% to 80% increased capacity. And then following up on the slower season, typically in this first half of the year. I mean is it possible that you guys end up with no slow season at all this year effectively, where kind of the exit run rate of Q4 volume could kind of extend at least for home standby into Q1 and Q2?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, let me -- I'll deal with the first part of the question, Phil, and I'll let York kind of tackle the second part as it relates to how the seasonality, again, we've been talking about the distorted seasonality, I think, given some of the some of the things that are going on right now. But on the site selection, we're evaluating a number of sites. We have most of our manufacturing base here in the U.S. is in Wisconsin. We have six factories here. We love the State of Wisconsin. Our customers, though, as we develop the home standby markets and our storage markets, they're out west, they're further down south. So, we're looking at -- we're evaluating Wisconsin in the mix, of course. But frankly, I would think that where you're probably likely to see something is if you think anything from Northern Texas across to the Carolinas, we're kind of evaluating through there just really -- just based primarily on reduced logistics cost and timelines. We should have a decision finalized here, I would say, in the next 30 to 60 days, we want to negotiate with locally to make sure we've got the right understanding of local codes and things. I mean, obviously, that always comes into play when you're manufacturing. So, we're picking a site though that can move for speed. Speed is the critical element here. We want to have this facility up and operating by midyear next year and really fully ramped by the end of next year at the latest. We've already put down orders for all the machine tooling and things that are going to go into this longer lead-time type of things that we know we're going to need to equip this factory. So we've got that on order. We just don't know where it's going to go. So we haven't given them a shipping address yet, but that's kind of the -- how we're thinking about capacity. And then again, you mentioned it's like a 70% to 80% increase overall in the production capabilities or ultimate capacity products. And then York…
York Ragen: Yeah, in terms of seasonality for next year, while we're not giving guidance for next year, as Aaron has been talking about, our backlog is significant now, and we're going to continue to evaluate what that looks like at the end of the year and what it's going to look like coming into next year. But I guess from a production standpoint, you're absolutely right. We're going to be producing full speed really throughout all of next year, and which means from a production standpoint, you won't have that lull in the first quarter and then building into the second quarter and then and then maxing on the second half. We're going to be producing full out pretty much all of next year, right?
Philip Shen: Great. Thanks for that color. Really helpful. As it relates to any pinch points in the manufacturing, are you constrained on any of your inputs at all, engine blocks or anything like that? And then shifting to clean energy, with the success that you guys are seeing in the marketplace based on some of the checks that we've done, are you possibly going to be able to deliver on more than 125-megawatt hours of storage in 2020? At one point, you guys were had a range of $125 million to $150 million, but just kind of wanting to understand if you guys have some upside there? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. Thanks, Phil. Yeah, I'll just address just pinch points. Supply chain is tight. We're working actively with all of our suppliers to continue to improve their output levels, but they have a lot of the same challenges we have with manpower. I mean, just managing factories today in the COVID-19 world is -- well, I don't know if there's an easier way to say it is a pain in the butt. I mean it's difficult. It’s presented a new kind of layer of complexity there that none of us really need when you're trying to run a factory, and that extends all the way up to supply chain. So we're good right now, and we'll have to continue to work with these guys because, obviously, if we're going to increase max capacity longer term that means supply chain's got to get there, too. That's probably going to come in the form of adding new suppliers and second and third type of sources in some cases where – and broadly, we have a lot of secondary sources already on. We may have to go to third sources. So that's -- that's where that's at. But we're managing kind of day-to-day. And then on clean energy. Yeah, again, we've reiterated our guidance there. We feel really good about the V-shaped recovery that's taking hold in clean energy. I think it really -- everybody's been talking about it. I know, Phil, you -- in particular, you talked to a lot of the companies involved in this space. We saw exactly what everybody else saw, just a pretty solid recovery there in the third quarter and accelerating here in the fourth quarter. I think that's the exciting thing about it. And then I just step back from the whole thing, and I look at where we were a year ago with the start up businesses. I mean, this business was, I don't know, what was it, York, it was $10 million of revenues?
York Ragen: Yeah.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And we're running towards that kind of 1.15 [ph] number or whatever the previous guidance, and I think that was our previous guidance. So I mean, to do that in a year and then have the runway that with our new product pipeline that I'm looking at, I am really excited. I mean, our teams have been working tirelessly here. Russ Minick, who heads up that business for us, has been really driving the team, doing a nice job, bringing these start-ups together. And then you put Enbala as a mix there, going forward, and just really positive on longer term where we're going…
York Ragen: And turning profitable in Q4. That's another…
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, September was our first month of profit in that business. And Q4 is going to be nicely profitable for us as well. And we anticipate accelerating off of that as we kind of laid out previously.
Operator: We have our next question from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Mark Strouse: Good morning. Thank you very much for taking our questions..
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning.
Mark Strouse: In an effort to completely beat a dead horse, I'd like to go back to capacity. Can you just kind of give some color on how you came up with that 70% to 80% expansion? Is there a target utilization rate that you're going for? And I guess, how much wiggle room do you foresee leaving yourself before you are looking for a third site?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So it's a great question, Mark. And the way our business works, we have these – we have obviously some pronounced seasonality spikes in demand that can happen from time to time. This – what we're seeing right now is abnormal to anything we've ever seen. But if you think about – the way we think about sizing a factory and the way we think about this new site, we really wanted to give ourselves. So we think about utilization being in that kind of max. You get above 80% to 85% utilization in the facility, and you start to run the risk of equipment shutdowns and other things, and you run a lot of overtime generally when you're up in those levels. So we're kind of sizing it, thinking around that 80% number in terms of utilization between the two sites that we would have. The $70 million to $80 million that we called out as an increase is – it's a function on the one end of using that 80% utilization assumption. But then it's also a function of saying, 'Hey, seasonally, we know that our incoming demand can spike upwards of – could be 52, in this case, a lot more than that. But let's say, on average, 50% higher at certain peak points. So we wanted to size the facility to give ourselves some room that even if we were operating at that 80% effective utilization rate, that we would have the ability once demand returns to normal patterns. That's kind of the assumption underpinning all this, by the way, if it doesn't, we'll be talking about a third facility we'll have to add, right? So – but assuming it returns to more normal levels in the future, along the lines of what our long-range plan kind of indicated, we would give – the new factory would give us basically some expansion capacity or between the two facilities, depending on how we want to balance it out, it would give us some expansion capacity to take those seasonal demand increases. If you see a hurricane or an ice storm or a power shutoff, a safety shutoff out in California, something like that. So that's how we're sizing it, and that's how we're thinking about it going forward.
Mark Strouse: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, York. Are you able to say, what percentage of the increase in the guidance for this year was organic versus the acquisitions?
York Ragen: Well, the acquisitions were relatively small to the increase in guide if we went from 5% to 8% to 10% to 12%, it was maybe 1% – about 1%, maybe roughly, not even 1%,
Aaron Jagdfeld: Not even a full percent.
York Ragen: Not even a full percent of that.
Aaron Jagdfeld: They're really small. Especially, well, Mean Green seasonally, they don't have – they're mowing companies.
York Ragen: They think of it all roughly about $10 million businesses and you get basically a quarter to a quarter and half of roughly almost two quarter to two [ph] quarters of revenue there.
Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian Drab: Hi, good morning. Obviously, very impressive results. I was just wondering on the capacity expansion. Can you talk at all about how much it will cost to set up this facility and then, I mean, I guess if you're saying around 80% expansion, we're talking about a facility that can do something like $800 million in revenue. That's the ballpark maybe for the capacity? I'm trying to get a sense for what the return on investment is for this expansion? : Yes. I mean, the – I mean, it's a great question, Brian, and one that we don't make any decision around here, unless we're looking at the return that we can get for money that we invest on anything, really. I mean, and a new facility would be no different than how we think of everything else. I would say this, home standby being a pretty unique and special category of product for us. It's almost very difficult for me to come up with any kind of investment number that we don't get a great return on given the profile, the financial profile of those products and the growth rates of the product. So in terms of the quantum around the investment necessary, some of that's still up in the air in terms of whether we lease a facility or whether we own it. We're working through that as part of the site selection. So I'd be premature to give any kind of a number around that. But again, in the context of how we think about capital spending here, our kind of we've always said kind of 2% to 2.5% of revenues is our capital spending benchmark and what we need. Next year, frankly, we're probably going to be in that 2.5% to maybe 3% at the outside edge of that because some growth CapEx, but we're not talking about hundreds of millions of dollars here for a new facility. It's something quite a bit less than that.
Brian Drab: Okay. So yes, I mean, that was my impression is that -- I mean, this is -- I had no idea, but I would think it's -- you're in the $50 million range or less, and that you can do generate a couple of hundred million in EBITDA out of this facility. It seems like the ROIC is off the chart. So I was trying to give you a soft fall there.
York Ragen: Great return.
Aaron Jagdfeld: The ROI is excellent.
Brian Drab: And it's -- I mean, it seems like it's like well over 100% on that. I'll follow-up with 2 more later on that. And then can you just comment quickly on the C&I and I know that rental CapEx is down for the year, but are the trends that are improving? And does that bode well for growth on easy comps for C&I in 2021?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. The C&I business, actually, the stationary C&I business, kind of our legacy C&I business is actually decent. It was better than we thought it was going to be in the quarter. But mobile just continues to be a struggle for us, the mobile equipment sector. And from everything we've seen in the marketplace and talking to our customer base, I think we're pretty much in line with everybody else. I don't think it's a generic specific issue. It's an industry-wide issue on fleet utilization rates and just capital spending pullback by the large nationals. We're eagerly watching them to understand kind of their guidance for next year on spending. We're having conversations with them right now. I would tell you, I mean, just me, this is Aaron's thoughts around this. But my -- based on everything that I've seen, if it's a recovery next year, it's a back half of next year recovery, in my opinion, and I don't know, I just -- there could be -- maybe that can accelerate if there's some magical stimulus thing that hits around infrastructure earlier. But I don't hold out a lot of hope. So we've been talking about stimulus for a long time here, and we just can't even get -- seem to get – get everybody's head on straight with getting that done. It needs to get done. And when it does eventually get done, we're going to be in a really good spot for that. But until that happens, I just think that – I think 2021 will be a recovery year, but I think it's probably – I just -- I'm handicapping, it's more back half of the year than the front half.
Operator: You have your next question from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ross Gilardi: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in the end.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good Morning, Ross.
Ross Gilardi: Good morning. I just was wondering, is there any pricing opportunity here beyond the norms? I mean, you're sold out, the lead times are extended, you dominate the market here. Is that something that could generate some upside for you? Just like what's your pricing philosophy in the cycle market?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. It's a great question, Ross. There's two angles on pricing that I would address. One is the normal seasonal discounting cadences that we would have -- we haven't had to do it, right? So in effect, by doing less discounting, we're getting more price. I mean that's kind of how I view price. I still think price as I think about home standby, that idea of affordability is still a really important thing there. And so the second piece of pricing. So first is less discounting, which effectively gets us a little bit better pricing position. The second part, though, is we continue to introduce products that help us raise the ASP, which is effectively what we did with the 24-kilowatt machine that we introduced earlier this year. Oddly enough, the way it works out for the homeowner, it's actually a little bit better deal on a per KW basis. So at a retail price point, they actually -- when it's fully installed because the installation really doesn't cost more. So they actually get a better deal in terms of just on a per kilowatt basis. And we get a better deal on an ASP per unit basis. So in effect, I think we have taken some pricing there through new product introduction and less discounting. But as we kind of put together our 2021 plan, we always talk about pricing. We look -- really, what we look at is what are the cost headwinds that we might be facing next year. So as those become maybe a little bit more known, I think, rather than say we will or won't take pricing at this point in the game I think I'll probably reserve those comments for kind of the 2021 guide once we put all that together.
Ross Gilardi: All right. And then I want to ask you on top of that, distribution, obviously, your footprint has expanded dramatically, particularly in California, but as you guys have pointed out, and as you can see in the data, I mean, the demand is coming from everywhere. I mean I think there are 300,000 people out of power in Oklahoma yesterday, if I saw it right on your database, you had the Midwest storms in the ice states, I think Utah was -- I mean, do you have distribution in all of these places to monetize that demand? And are there any investments that you're thinking you need to make, even though you've got third-party distribution to make sure you're scooping up all the acorns here because it seems like they're everywhere beyond the big obvious centers of demand for Generac?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. I think that's the unique thing about this business, Ross, and I've seen this over my career here is that when you get events, whether it be an ice storm in Oklahoma or whether it's an outage in Utah, you're right. I mean, like Salt Lake City doesn't get a lot of outages. And so those areas of the country, you'll see distribution kind of fill in after an event, right? So initially, the initial surge of demand is generally satisfied by people who are maybe in our database as dealers. They maybe are contractors buying through -- could be through retail or online or perhaps electrical wholesale types of entities. And that's why the omnichannel distribution strategy is so important in this category, because I mean the dealer channel is absolutely -- and in my opinion, the best way to acquire this product, if you're a homeowner, you want a turnkey solution. The dealer can take care of it from the beginning of the process, all the way through and make that as pain-free as possible, as you possibly can, make a home improvement project. But you're right. I mean, the fill in that has to happen in the areas of the country where we haven't had these types of events. And we're going through that curve right now. It's a maturity curve. We're going through in California. We're adding a lot of distribution out there. It's an area of the country that's not -- they're not as familiar with the product category, the familiarity, the challenges run not just from finding good representation in the market and then onboarding the representation, there's actually a full education process all the way through the value stream, going back to the -- the permits, right? I mean you might have to talk to an inspector who has ever written a permit for a generator before. And so, they have questions about the product, they have questions about the placement of the product, the operation of the product, and as you can imagine, that's an education process, a learning curve for everybody involved. The friction gets reduced over time as people get more familiar and as we fill in with more dealers. But, generally, there's quite a bit of friction on the front end to get these markets started. So, I think, what's great about us is we've got a lot of learning cycles here. We've been through this a lot. In terms of investment, we continue to invest in things like training in our PowerPlay selling platform, which is really critical, especially for new dealers coming onboard, to give them a ready-made sales process and put that in their hands, it makes them that much more successful out of the gate, which gets them really engaged with the category and with us, which is just a good thing for all of us long term. So we're going to make -- we're going to continue to make those investments at elevated levels. We're going to continue to put marketing dollars in the regions that we haven't. We've never advertised in Utah before. But we've got infomercials running in Salt Lake City today. In Iowa, in Illinois, in Oklahoma, we will be on the air probably in the next couple of weeks. California, we're blitzing the California markets with a lot of media right now. And so, it's the development of those markets. Market development, and this is -- not to belabor the point, because we're getting long-winded here, but the idea of going in and creating a market versus simply going into an existing market and fighting for share are two completely different things for a business, I think, to deal with. Creating a market, you have to burn a lot more calories with distribution and brand awareness, category awareness, all those things that we just talked about, that is hard work. It's really -- it's quite missionary and it really pays off over the long run. And we're going to see the need to do that in a lot of these markets, as you pointed out.
Operator: We have our next question from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Jeff.
York Ragen: Hi, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond: Hey. So my questions are on the CE side of the business. Just, I think you talked about a 30% attach rate on new solar installs. Can you just talk about what you think the long-term opportunity is? And then, just kind of update us on where you are in terms of introducing something that could go at the retrofit side?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. So on the attachment rate, Jeff, we think that the attachment rate -- first of all, it's completely blown past, I think, all the expectations, right, in terms of -- it was coming from something like high mid -- high singles to 10% last year to almost 30% this year, it's approaching 30% now. So it surprised, I think, everybody in the market with the -- and a lot of that, I think, underpinning that back to what I was talking about before, the resiliency element is driving, I think, that attachment rate a lot quicker, the need, and that's really, I think, indicative of the power outage environment, the elevated power outage environment that we're in, in particular, in states like California, where we have a lot of solar going in and already installed. So, where it could go long-term? There have been some projections out there that say, a 50% attachment rate maybe long-term. We've got some customers that are over 60% and approaching 70%. Some of our solar channel partners are already at that level because they're operating in certain states or regions where maybe net metering is reducing in terms of the impact. So, in order to get the right ROI on a solar install, you've got to add a battery, right? So, it's kind of coming at it from both the resiliency side and in some markets, the necessity side economically to make the math work. So, it could -- where it could go, I think 50% is probably an easy target long-term. As far as the retrofit market, you're going to hear from us again, this robust product pipeline that I've been talking about. We've got some cool things coming really think next year around -- that are aimed a little bit more cleanly at that retro market. We think it is a decent market. There's a couple of million rooftops out there that have solar on them already. And if attachment rates on new solar are approaching 30%, then existing should be an opportunity as well. So, we don't want to ignore that. There are some technical things that we can get there, we can do it today, but there's some new product offerings coming next year that will reduce the complexity technically to making that happen and make it easier to retrofit a system.
Jeff Hammond: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Jeff.
Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens. Your line is open.
Tommy Moll: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey Tommy.
Tommy Moll: I want to follow-up on the home standby business. So, this has been a great year. It sounds like with backlog continuing to reach new record levels next year shaping up to be a good one as well. And then today, there's been a lot of commentary around the increased capacity, which is a decision, I know you don't make without a lot of consideration. So, my question is, in order to get comfortable to invest in a new facility, what are the things you have seen change in terms of the medium term, let's say, demand outlook here? And what I mean is, obviously, with the home-as-a-sanctuary trend, you've had some event-specific demand pick up, but my hunch is you're seeing a broader base and more durable improvement in that market. And so I'm curious how you would describe that for us -- as you get closer to turning dirt on a new facility?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. No, it's something we're thinking about it at a very high level, even in our boardroom. Obviously, we're talking about these things in terms of -- and what we've kind of what we've kind of -- the words we're using are, are we at a tipping point? Are we at a tipping point for the category, right? So, we're approaching, as we said, probably about 5% penetration of single-family households, single-family unattached homes greater than $100,000 in value. That's the total addressable market. It's 53 million homes or something like that. That 5% of that number is where the market will be at the end of the year. That still means 95% of the homes don't have it. And when you look at the things that have transpired this year, and you think about -- let's just think about home-as-a-sanctuary of that trend and what the pandemic has done. I think the pandemic, as a lot of companies are pointing out, has accelerated some of the long-standing trends that were already happening, things like telecommuting. I mean we've been talking about telecommuting for decades, right? So a way to cut down on having to drive to work and the amount of time you spending your car. And the technology today is far greater in its capabilities to allow for some of the things that have happened. In fact, I can't even imagine. Like if we had had this pandemic 10 years ago, 5 years ago, just how much more difficult it would have been for society in general, to deal with the idea of being kind of mandated to stay in your home. Today, you can work from home. Your Kids can learn from home. I was on a call recently, one of our customers did a top-to-top kind of CEO forum. And on the call, it was mentioned, you think about school, as an example, here in Wisconsin, we'll have a couple of days a year where we get some heavy snow and you have a snow day. Kids love that. I love it as a kid. Going forward, kids aren't going to have snow days. They'll have virtual learning days, right? So the -- but in order to enable that, you've got to have the technology one, which is the ability to do that, and you've got a power to enable that technology. And I think the conclusion that people are reaching is that, look, my home is going to become my office, it's going to become my classroom, it's going to become my gym, it's going to become my -- where I shop, all of those things are going to happen in the home. And none of them happen without a source of power. If your power is out and look at the outages that are going on. And the more people that experience outages the more people are concluding that, look, this is not an option anymore, where it was maybe a nice to have before, and this is the tipping point, tipping point from nice to have to necessity. And that's really what we're talking about as a tipping point. So as we think about the future of the category and we think about where this is going, I think we see a future where back of power, whether it's a generator or whether that's an energy storage system, as that technology continues to develop, we think it's going to be imperative that all homes and businesses have some level of that resiliency built in going forward.
Operator: Our next question from the line of Joseph Osha with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Joseph Osha: Hello guys. Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to return to this issue of FERC 2222 and this notion of distributed energy assets. So if you look at storage, it's mostly third-party owned at this point, right, and that makes it relatively straightforward to sign up. If you look at your network of generators, which are mostly owned by the people that bought them, how do you go about this process of signing them up to distribute in something like a grid services deal?
Aaron Jagdfeld: No, you're onto it, Joe. In terms of just some of the additional complexities, and that's why I hesitated to kind of talk about how we would monetize that because you do have that added complexity that is different from storage and that you've got -- you're dealing with an individual homeowner, right? I mean that's where the unit is owned and operated by the homeowner. So the programs that could be available to that homeowner, they don't -- they're not necessarily different than the programs that could be available to a third party operator. There's just a lot more individual conversations than having a conversation with say 1/3 party that might own and operate a couple of thousand megawatt hours of storage, right? So it's just -- it's a different conversation. And it's and they're numerous ones, right? There are numerous conversations. But you could – I could still find a path there that would give you a conversation to engage with a homeowner, let's say you've got a homeowner out in Florida and -- or Michigan or California doesn't really matter where it is. But if you had a utility company locally that had a need for this kind of balancing opportunity that exists with – as an example within Enbala's network and with their approach to things, and that opportunity is – that asset, I should say, is valuable to that utility company. So it might actually be just pairing the utility with that owner.
York Ragen: Then just making the introduction.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It’s just making the introduction to the utility company. Utility company could have the program. They have that homeowners information because they're providing power today. So we kind of see it probably looking more like that longer-term is a utility kind of based type of approach where the utility companies could enroll those assets using – maybe it's a volatile platform to help enable. There could be some pieces of technology that have to be put into that, too. So there's – you're talking about maybe it's not thousands of dollars, maybe a couple of hundred dollars of pieces of equipment, but again, depends on how valuable that asset is to the utility, and there are certain utilities around the U.S. that are going to find that very valuable because they have constraints and they have kind of this volatility around the supply side that they've got to deal with as renewables become a bigger percentage of their supply.
Operator: We have our last question from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Aaron, can you talk about your update in terms of points of light, if you will, on the clean energy distribution side, where are you today? And I'm sure you have a pipeline that you're working on. Can you just give us a look forward on where you think it will be if we look at a couple of quarters?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So we continue to pick up users of our PowerPlay CE platform. That's kind of how we're looking at people who are actually quoting through the platform. Today, it's about getting closer to 700 users on that platform. We think that we can be close to 1,000 by the end of the year. And so we've got a lot of work to still do with clean energy, and that's part of just kind of leaning into building out the distribution there. Also, I would just point out, as we announced previously, this partnership that we have with Senova, we're really excited about that. They've got some great dealer partners as well. So getting them up the curve, we actually began to transact here in Q3 with Sunnova, and that's going to accelerate through the back half of the year here. But we're doing a lot of training right now and introducing people to Generac the name. For those that aren't familiar with us, in the space and more specifically, our solution, our PWRcell solution and our HEMS, Home Energy Management Solutions. And that's going to be a major focal point for us going forward. Because for us to be successful here, if there's anything that we've learned but the home standby business is the importance of the points of light around distribution, and that is a critical area of focus going forward.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over back to Mike Harris.
Mike Harris: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings results with you in mid-February of next year. Thanks again, and goodbye.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-31 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 Generac Holdings Inc. Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Harris, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Harris: Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're excited to discuss our financial results reported earlier this morning, in which sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were all records for a second quarter, and were led by strong growth in residential products of approximately 27%. Relative to expectations, second quarter revenue dramatically exceeded our prior forecast, and adjusted EBITDA margins were much higher than previously forecasted, primarily due to the higher-than-expected shipments of residential products, which led to a considerable favorable mix impact on profitability. Home standby shipments came in significantly higher than our prior forecast, primarily driven by robust demand as a result of the heightened awareness of the need for backup power since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also experienced higher-than-expected growth for Chore products sold directly to consumers as homeowners increased outdoor project activity while spending more time at home. As expected, the ongoing pandemic around the world had an adverse impact on demand for C&I products during the second quarter, but collectively, shipments were modestly better than our prior forecast. On a year-over-year basis, net sales increased approximately 1% during the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the strong prior year second quarter. Gross margin, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, expanded 330 basis points compared to prior year. And adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 22.5%, increasing 190 basis points over the prior year as both exceeded our expectations primarily due to favorable mix from higher-than-expected shipments of residential products. Before discussing second quarter results in more detail, I wanted to stress that as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, a high degree of uncertainty exists regarding the magnitude and timing of an economic recovery and the potential impacts on our end markets and overall business. However, what appears to be fairly clear to date is that demand for our residential products is significantly benefiting from an emerging trend that we are referring to as Home as a Sanctuary, where millions of people are working, learning, shopping, entertaining and, in general, spending more time at home. Primarily as a result of this trend, along with the elevated concerns about future outages, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and earnings outlook for 2020, including much higher expectations for the second half of the year. We'll provide further details regarding this updated guidance in the outlook portion of our prepared remarks this morning. Now discussing our second quarter results in more detail. Shipments for home standby generators during the quarter once again increased at a very strong rate compared to the prior year driven by the heightened awareness since the onset of COVID-19 and also benefiting from the elevated outage activity and awareness events in recent years, an above-average hurricane forecast for 2020 and a significant increase in demand in California. Several key metrics that we monitor closely for home standby demand continued to be exceptionally strong during the second quarter. Activations grew at a very substantial rate compared to the prior year, with broad-based strength across all U.S. regions and Canada. This strength was led by robust growth in the West region driven by California and the South Central and Southeast regions. The combination of in-home and virtual consultations rose dramatically during the second quarter, with broad-based strength across the country and outsized growth in California, Florida and Texas, in particular. More importantly, home consultations during the quarter experienced strong growth in every single state in the contiguous U.S. which we believe supports our view of the emerging Home as a Sanctuary trend. The power outage severity environment also continues to trend above baseline levels with outages significantly higher during the second quarter relative to the prior year. In fact, outage severity on a trailing 12-month basis has notably exceeded the long-term baseline average in recent years. We also ended the second quarter with over 6,700 residential dealers, an increase of approximately 650 or 11% compared to the end of the prior year second quarter. This includes a significant increase in California, ramping up to over 450 dealers at the end of the quarter from approximately 200 dealers at the end of the prior year second quarter. More recently, early in the third quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to be much higher relative to prior year levels. Specifically regarding home consultations, as previously discussed during our last earnings call, we mentioned that April home consultations were up approximately double versus the prior year. And since that time, this tremendous strength has continued through July. We believe this increase can be attributed to several factors: overall power outage severity continuing to trend above baseline levels; second half predictions for a well above-average Atlantic hurricane season; the prospects for an active wildfire season in California; and now, the emerging trend of Americans viewing their homes as a sanctuary. Importantly, our dealers now have the ability to offer a homeowner a traditional in-home consultation or one that can be largely conducted remotely, which we are referring to as a virtual home consultation or VHC. During the second quarter, we rolled out the VHC process through aggressive communication and training. And to date, our dealers are experiencing similar close rates and sales cycle times in relation to the in-home visits they have traditionally used. Recall that our previous guidance anticipated a decline in close rates, assuming a lower consumer spending environment during the pandemic. However, overall close rates have actually remained consistent with historical trends, which gives us confidence to raise the outlook for residential products for the full year. Also, the exceptional strength in home standby demand is occurring much earlier in the year than normal before we even enter the heart of the hurricane and wildfire seasons, which typically doesn't occur until the latter half of the third quarter or early into the fourth quarter. Should these additional events materialize, we could see additional growth, particularly for portable generators. With demand for home standby generators at an all-time high, we are working to aggressively ramp our supply chain and production levels to satisfy the increased demand for these products, and we are targeting to be at record daily build rates by the fourth quarter. This production ramp also includes the official launch next week of the industry's largest air cooled generator, a 24-kilowatt machine that will add to our broad product offering and increase our competitive advantage in the market. This product comes on the heels of a number of other industry-leading features and products introduced over the last several years that have continued to advance our goals of driving the availability, affordability and awareness of the home standby generator category. Further lending support of an emerging Home as a Sanctuary trend, we also experienced strong growth for our Chore products during the quarter, which significantly exceeded our expectations. Recall that Chore products consist of a wide range of specialty outdoor power equipment, including field and brush mowers, chipper shredders, log splitters, stump grinders and pressure washers and are used in a variety of property maintenance applications. The strength experienced during the quarter was led by the sale of these products directly to consumers as homeowners increased outdoor project activity while spending more time at home. So far, in the third quarter, demand for these products continues to outpace normal seasonality as homeowners spend much more time in the yards working on out of our projects. Rounding out our discussion on residential products is an update on clean energy. The secular growth opportunity within the U.S. market for energy storage and monitoring systems remains very compelling, through a combination of changing regulations, advancements in technologies, improving economics and the increased resiliency desired from these products. Although shipments of our recently launched PWRcell Energy Storage Systems contributed to the company's year-over-year growth in the second quarter, they declined on a sequential basis as the overall solar market was negatively impacted by a sharp drop in the pace of installations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in solar installations was due to permitting delays and other restrictions, including certain instances where this activity was deemed nonessential by certain state and local municipalities. The consensus expectation for the solar industry is for a V-shaped recovery for installations during the second half of the year. Based on this outlook and the visibility we have through existing orders and our sales pipeline, along with recent trends for home consultations and system activations, we're still expecting strong sequential improvement in PWRcell shipments during the third and fourth quarters. With the overall pullback in the solar market during the second quarter, we now believe shipments of energy storage systems for full year 2020 to be at the low end of our previous guidance range of 125 to 150-megawatt hours of product. This outlook remains significantly ahead of the expectations we discussed during our Investor Day last September, which reflects our success in the marketplace to date as well as the increasing level of solar-plus-storage attachment rates that the industry is experiencing, in part driven by homeowner concerns over backup power. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we're making good progress in building out our clean energy dealer base, ramping our technical support capabilities and reducing our system costs. In addition, we continue to be excited about our new Sunnova partnership, and we're off to a very encouraging start as we've begun engaging and providing leads to their distributors. We see the relationship as a strategic partnership and expect a solid sales ramp starting in the third quarter. We're also making important strides in growing this nascent market through targeted advertising, lead generation and virtual in-home sales capabilities. Our new clean energy infomercials began airing earlier this year and continues to be very well received, and is driving good lead volume into our recently launched lead management and selling system that we call PowerPlay CE. We have also made important progress thus far in 2020 in developing an innovative pipeline of new products that will be coming to market over the next several quarters. We believe these new products will further enhance our competitive position and differentiation in the energy storage, monitoring and management market and will ultimately provide what consumers really want, a whole house storage solution with load management capabilities that confide energy independence. While the impact of the pandemic has resulted in a brief softening in the market for energy storage for 2020, particularly in the second quarter, we believe the longer-term drivers remain firmly in place. With installations of these systems still forecasted to experience exceptional growth over the next several years, we believe we are favorably positioned to participate in that growth by leveraging our strong brands, innovative product portfolio and lead generation capabilities. With regard to our C&I products, it's quite clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant adverse impact on the overall market for power generation and related equipment given major declines in GDP growth rates around the world. Domestic shipments of C&I products declined during the second quarter at a significant rate as compared to the prior year, but we're modestly ahead of our expectations as discussed during our last earnings call. As expected, shipments of mobile products to national rental account customers declined significantly during the quarter, primarily due to the continued impact of the pandemic and the collapse in oil prices. Recall that demand for mobile equipment was already softening at the beginning of this year as many of our national rental customers were deferring some capital spending. The sudden decline in economic activity and corresponding drop in fleet utilization in March forced them to further and dramatically reduce equipment purchases, which has carried over into the second quarter. Shipments to national telecom customers also declined at a considerable rate on a year-over-year basis as compared to a strong prior year comparison as these customers initially deprioritized capital spending certain capital spending in response to the current environment. Additionally, with the formal approval of the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint on April 1, capital spending for these companies is expected to be lower in the short-term as they combine and rationalize their network assets. Recall that demand trends with telecom national customers can vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of capital deployment and project planning cycles. Lastly, shipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel were also lower in the quarter as this channel began to experience the impacts from a decline in project quoting as nonresidential construction activity continued to slow. However, the significant decline in quotations for new projects experienced in March and April during the onset of the pandemic has recovered somewhat in recent months, which has improved the overall outlook for this channel for the remainder of the year. Additionally, our C&I product outlook now includes the recent acquisition of Energy Systems, our industrial distributor located in Northern California. This acquisition enhances our ability to serve what we view as one of the largest power generation markets in the U.S. for both C&I and residential products. We want to welcome the approximately 50-person team of Energy Systems into the Generac family and look forward to expanding our presence in the rapid growing California market. As expected, the ongoing global pandemic had a significant impact on demand outside the U.S. and Canada during the second quarter. As COVID-19 moved from China in January to Europe in February and then on to Latin America, the first quarter demand environment was challenging and worsened considerably during the latter part of that period and into the second quarter. As GDP growth rates were sharply reduced around the world, revenues for our International segment in the second quarter declined approximately 25% on a core basis compared to the prior year. These declines were broad-based in almost every market that we serve and magnified the slower economic growth and geopolitical headwinds that were already being experienced in recent quarters. Despite this weakness, overall International revenue during the second quarter moderately exceeded our expectations. And our current full year outlook is also slightly more favorable for this business as certain regions such as Europe are trending better than previously feared. Recall that last quarter, we discussed the execution of between $25 million to $30 million of cost reduction initiatives that we were targeting across the business to address an expected slowdown in demand from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Given the magnitude of the downturn in demand for C&I products, where shipments declined 33% over the prior year, we initiated a number of meaningful restructuring actions for this part of our business during the second quarter to better align our cost structure with current global customer demand trends. Accordingly, as reported in our earnings release earlier this morning, the second quarter includes $11.5 million of pre-tax charges related to business optimization, noncash asset writedowns and other restructuring costs, with the vast majority related to C&I products. The specific restructuring efforts were mostly within our mobile and international operations and include work furloughs and headcount reductions as well as the recording of a number of noncash asset write downs. We believe these actions are necessary to address the longer-term negative impacts from the pandemic, and we estimate the cost reductions will yield approximately $10 million to $12 million of annualized cost savings once fully implemented by the end of the year. With the strength in our residential business, the original cost reduction actions are more muted as the $25 million to $30 million of initial savings are partially offset by incremental incentive compensation and headcount investments given our increased outlook. Although near-term market conditions are challenging for these businesses, we remain optimistic on the long-term opportunity for mobile products, which aligns with an expected fleet replacement cycle nearer-term and the compelling mega-trend of much needed infrastructure investments around the world. In addition, the secular growth opportunities remain intact for our international businesses, including the increasing penetration of home standby and natural gas generators for commercial and industrial applications, alongside the market share opportunities in supplying critical support equipment for wireless telecom sites and entering the emerging space for energy storage for both residential and C&I applications. In closing, we remain very excited about our future growth prospects, which are driven by several mega-trends and powerful macro secular drivers. And we will continue to aggressively invest in the strategic initiatives that align with Generac's Powering Our Future strategy. Demand for the company's residential generators continues to benefit from the trend of increasing power outages as a result of more severe weather, driven in part by global warming. And as we have discussed this morning, recent demand for these products are now clearly benefiting from the new and emerging Home as a Sanctuary trend with millions more working, learning, shopping, entertaining and spending much more time at home. In addition, we're confident that once we get through this pandemic, future growth prospects for our C&I products remain compelling, driven by: the increasing penetration of natural gas generators in a wide variety of applications, the major investment cycle needed for legacy infrastructure and wireless telecommunications shifting to 5G architecture. We are also extremely excited about the long-term growth opportunity for our clean energy products, including the potential to leverage and combine our new capabilities in energy storage, monitoring and management with our core competencies and strategies with natural gas generators. We believe this will better enable us to enter new and adjacent markets that align with the evolving mega-trend around the disruption of the traditional electrical utility model, including decentralization of the grid and a migration toward distributed energy resources. I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our second quarter results. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at our second quarter 2020 results in more detail. Net sales increased $546.8 million during the second quarter of 2020 as compared to $541.9 million in the prior year second quarter, resulting in core sales growth of approximately 1%. Looking at consolidated net sales for the second quarter by product class, residential product sales during the second quarter increased 27.2% to $341.4 million as compared to $268.4 million in the prior year. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth, which was approximately 30%. Supplementing the home standby strength during the second quarter was a significant increase in shipments of portable generators, primarily as a result of the much higher power outage activity in the current year quarter and the overall needs for backup power since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. The growth in residential product sales also benefited from the higher shipments of Chore products, along with the shipments of the recently launched PWRcell Energy Storage Systems. Commercial and industrial product net sales for the second quarter of 2020 declined 32.8% to $154.9 million as compared to $230.4 million in the prior year quarter, with a core sales decline of approximately 31% when excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency. The significant weakness in shipments of C&I products was broad-based, both domestically and internationally. The continued negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the deferral of capital spending with our national rental account customers. In addition, shipments to telecom national accounts declined sharply as T-Mobile took a pause in capital spending following their merger with Sprint, and shipments to industrial distributors also declined during the second quarter.  Internationally, C&I products declined 27% compared to the prior year on a core basis due to the continued broad-based sharp drop in global demand caused by the pandemic. Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty revenue amortization and other service offerings, increased 17.4% to $50.6 million as compared to $43.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. A larger installed base of our products, higher power outage activity and higher levels of extended warranty revenue drove this increase versus the prior year. As previously discussed, second quarter results include the impact of $11.5 million of pre-tax charges relating to the business optimization and other restructuring costs to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and decline in oil prices. The cost actions taken include certain headcount reductions, noncash asset writedowns and other charges. The charges, which primarily relate to C&I products globally, consist of $6.3 million classified within cost of goods sold, and $5.2 million classified within operating expenses. Excluding the impact of these charges, gross profit margin improved 330 basis points to 39.4% compared to 36.1% in the prior year second quarter. And operating expenses increased $9.3 million or 8.9% as compared to the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA, before deducting for noncontrolling interest, as defined in our earnings release, was $123.1 million or 22.5% of net sales as compared to $111.9 million or 20.6% of net sales in the prior year. This 190 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin was primarily driven by the impressive gross margin expansion during the quarter due to a favorable sales mix, partially offset by the increased investment in operating expenses and the early ramp of our clean energy products. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 9.3% to $460.8 million as compared to $421.5 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter was $121.3 million or 26.3% of net sales as compared to $103.7 million in the prior year or 24.6% of net sales. International segment sales, which consist primarily of C&I products, declined 28.5% to $86.1 million as compared to $120.4 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales declined approximately 25% versus prior year when excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $1.9 million or 2.2% of net sales as compared to $8.2 million or 6.8% of net sales in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2020 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $66.1 million as compared to $62 million for the second quarter of 2019. GAAP income taxes during the current year second quarter were $18.5 million or an effective tax rate of 22.5% as compared to $18.8 million or an effective tax rate of 23.4%. The decline in tax rate was driven by a higher share-based compensation deductions and favorable geographical mix of earnings in the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.02 in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $0.98 in the prior year. The specific calculations for these earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $88.5 million in the current year quarter or $1.40 per share versus $74.9 million in the prior year or $1.20 per share. Cash income taxes for the second quarter of 2020 were $13.9 million as compared to $14.1 million in the prior year quarter. The current year now reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 17% for the full year 2020, which is consistent with the prior year expectation at that time. Cash flow from operations was $101.8 million as compared to $8 million in the prior year second quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was a positive $89 million as compared to a negative $9.8 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to a significant working capital investment that was made in the prior year, which did not repeat in the current year, along with modestly higher net income and lower capital expenditures during the current year quarter versus the prior year. Before discussing our updated outlook for 2020, it's important to reiterate our healthy balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of the second quarter of 2020, which allows us to confidently operate our business and execute our strategy even in this uncertain world. As of June 30, 2020, we had $689 million of liquidity, comprised of $397 million of cash on hand and $292 million of availability on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in June of 2023. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the second quarter was $896 million, net of unamortized original issued discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was only 1.9 times on an as-reported basis. Recall that in December 2019, we amended our term loan credit agreement which, among other things, extended the maturity of the term loan to December 2026, and we do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date. Also recall that there are no financial covenants on the term loan, and it has a low-cost of debt of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. In addition, earlier this year, we entered into some additional interest rate swap arrangements that hedge or fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. Further enhancing our overall liquidity is our strong cash flow profile. And over the last 12 months ended June 30, 2020, cash flow from operations and free cash flow were impressive at approximately $400 million and $350 million, respectively. Lastly, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we have significant resources to drive further shareholder value as we execute on our long-term strategic priorities, and our approach toward capital deployment remains disciplined, balanced and consistent. With that, I will now provide comments on our updated outlook for 2020. While we still expect the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on global C&I products to be severe, demand for our residential products has been extremely strong and overall better than expected, benefiting from the emerging Home as a Sanctuary trend and a continuation of other fundamental drivers, which drove significant revenue outperformance during the second quarter and is driving a much higher outlook for the second half of the year. Furthermore, our residential products have historically proven to be more resilient and tend to decouple from the broader economic environment as demand is more driven by power outages and power outage severity has continued to be favorable during 2020 relative to historical baseline levels. As a result of the incremental residential strength being experienced, we are raising our guidance for revenue growth for full year 2020 as we now expect overall net sales growth of approximately 5% to 8% versus the prior year, which compares to the previous guidance of 5% to 10% decline. At the midpoint, that is 14% additional revenue growth outlook between guidance statements. These growth rates assume normal baseline power outage activity for the remainder of the year as well as the benefit of one significant power shutoff event in California and a recovery of the solar market during the second half of the year. Net sales for residential products are now expected to see significant year-over-year growth for the full year 2020 as compared to the previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth. And C&I products are still expected to be down significantly versus prior year but slightly better than previously expected based on our prior guidance. As a result of improved operating leverage and favorable sales mix compared to previous guidance, we are also raising our margin expectations for full year 2020. Adjusted EBITDA margin is now expected to be approximately 21.5% to 22%, which is an increase from the 19% to 20% previously expected. This updated baseline guidance implies that adjusted EBITDA margins in the second half of the year will improve by approximately 300 basis points as compared to the first half of the year, which is largely due to improved operating leverage on higher sales volumes and favorable sales mix. Our baseline guidance anticipates that net sales and adjusted EBITDA margins will improve sequentially between the third and fourth quarters as we ramp up home standby production throughout the second half of the year. Specifically, net sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be appreciably higher on a sequential basis over the third quarter, even higher than normal baseline seasonality due to higher levels of home standby production during the fourth quarter with a further margin benefit from the improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes. Should the outage environment in the second half of 2020 be higher than our baseline guidance due to an active hurricane season and widespread utility shut offs in California, approximately 2% to 3% of additional revenue growth is possible beyond this baseline guidance. This upside potential is now expected to consist of heavier mix of portables as production for home standby generators is currently ramping up to meet existing demand. Operating and free cash flow generation for the full year 2020 is expected to remain strong, with the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow now anticipated to be approximately 90%, reflecting additional working capital investment required to ramp up our operations in response to higher demand. Lastly, interest expense is now expected to be approximately $33 million to $34 million for the year, a $3 million decrease from previous expectation, primarily as a result of lower market interest rates. The remaining guidance items provided in the previous earnings calls are not expected to change. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Brian Drab with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brian Drab: Hi. Good Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned, obviously, that consultations are way up in 2Q. And did you quantify that? Or can you quantify that? What do you see for total consultations in the second quarter year-over-year? And specifically, in California. I know last time you said they're up 10 times. Is it still kind of 10 times for the quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's up big, Brian. I mean, we haven't quoted specifically what they're up. But I think, stick to the prepared remarks here that they're up double again here in July, kind of third quarter. So it's a continuation of that theme, right? So we were up double in April, up double here in July. You can kind of back into probably what's in the middle there. But California is up big, continues to again off of a fairly low base. And we'll start coming up against some more difficult comps there in the back half. So you're not going to get the 10 times types of numbers we had quoted back in April. California is a big part of the increase. But I think I'd just point out, one comment we made this morning and probably the thing that floors me, and I've been around this business a long time. Every single state in the contiguous U.S. saw really strong growth in IHCs or home consultations during the quarter, which is amazing to me. I mean, I just the widespread nature of this, it's like kind of like a major event in every corner of the U.S.
Brian Drab: So Aaron, you said I think that home standby was up about 30% in the second quarter, and you raised the guidance by about $300 million at the midpoint. I know you said C&I is going to be a little bit better than you previously expected. But is it fair to say kind of embedded in the guidance, is it like close to 30% growth in home standby now for 2020?
York Ragen: Yes. It's going to be it's maybe not that rich, but it's going to be in that ballpark. And if you look at that $300 million increase that you mentioned in increased guidance. Roughly, maybe 2/3 of that is going to be home standby. So really strong growth at all it also points to what Aaron just mentioned that it's very broad-based. It's not just California. It's not just Florida. It's every state, there's high level of interest. And we're seeing the IHCs as well as then the lagging indicator of activations strong on a broad-based basis, which gave us confidence to with the raise in the guide.
Brian Drab: And then just a last question for me, if I could. I'm curious, given that you're seeing growth in every state in the U.S. It's unprecedented. There's this Home as a Sanctuary trend. Are you seeing increased demand for your home standby products in the international markets now? I know that's an area where longer term, you're hoping to penetrate further.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean, we have we've been seeing growth pretty consistently in home standby internationally. It's off of a very small base, obviously. But I think the bigger challenge around the international markets that we've as we've kind of built that out is the certifications and compliance are different from country to country. And frankly, even within countries, it can be a bit confusing and because the category is new in a lot of places. I'll just point to one example. I mean, Australia, which we've kind of coveted as a growing home standby market over the years. Just the relative difficulty in trying to get our products certified to all of the standards that Australia keeps throwing at the category. So we're finally there, and we've been pushing those products into the country there, and they've been all received. But again, it's going to take a while to grow, but longer term, there's, as you mentioned, Brian, we believe that internationally, there is there won't be any market that looks like the U.S., we don't think, but there are definite pockets of demand geographically that we'll be able to participate in.
Operator: And your next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Hey, good morning everyone. So maybe you could talk a little bit about lead times on the home standby side, what the conversion looks like? I know the conversion from in-home consultations to somebody booking something is good. But what does that look like then from conversion of order into actual installation or delivery? And then maybe just a little more context around why the sharp ramp from 3Q to 4Q above normal seasonality? Is that just related to lead times or some other sort of indicators there?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Mike, I'll take the first part of that question, and I'll leave the second part to York. But so on the first part, just in terms of backlog and demand and just kind of what things look like. Obviously, the robust demand there's seasonality normally in home standby, but normally, it happens kind of like around now. And kind of going into August, we'd start to see it pick up kind of latter half of third quarter going to the fourth quarter. That's been the normal seasonality in the category for 20 years. This year, it's just started three months earlier, four months earlier. Really as the pandemic took hold, and so we began ramping right away. We keep safety stock levels ahead of events because events can happen throughout the year. You can get an ice storm in the wintertime. You can get other events that are not in the normal seasonal cadence. So we do keep safety stock levels. And we obviously have finished good levels in our warehouses. And then we have a fairly robust field inventory as well of home standby that we talk about from time to time. All of those things are really low right now. Field inventory levels in terms of days of activated products are extremely low. Our field or our, excuse me, finished-good levels are very low. We would be, I think, in a backlog today. If you were to put a new order in, it's going to be a couple of weeks before you're going to get your hands on a machine. The normal sales cycle takes time though. So normally, there's a permitting process. So what would have normally happened previously and this repeats itself every time we go through these types of demand surges, is a dealer normally wouldn't or a channel partner wouldn't normally order a product from us until they have a permit in hand because there's just a certainty to it. They don't need to outlay any working capital then for the machine and they can install it as soon as it's delivered. All it does is it shifts the time when they order to ahead of when they get the permit. So from a customer perspective, they may not have to wait any longer. So the order cycle just might be happening a little sooner. So we're watching that to understand the overall impact. I think what's going to happen, though, is as we move into what is the traditional season, is that's probably going to get even more elevated or elongated in terms of the lead times. And so we expect that. We are working very diligently to increase production levels. In fact, we're the first time ever in our history, we're going to have a secondary site where we produce home standby generators as we enter the fourth quarter here. So we'll have two physical sites where we're producing the product. It's been largely the domain of our Whitewater, Wisconsin facility, but we're going to move production and expand production to a second facility. And we're going to levels we've never experienced before. I mean, these are really elevated levels of production, which is great. We made some key investments in automation about 1.5 years ago that look really, really smart now. We thought it was going to help us kind of for the next three to five years. It might help us for the next three to five months. And we're going to have to continue to invest beyond that. But we feel we're in decent a decent position. We've been here before. We know how to manage this. And our teams are pretty savvy at it. And it's fun. When it's going like this, it's fun. We're trying to hire 400 people right now. That's a challenge, but we'll get through that as well. But it's a the lead times are going to get longer. And then I think on the ramp, sequential ramp?
York Ragen: Yes, the seasonality just plays into what Aaron is talking about, ramping up that production and spinning up that second location. That will start really in the fourth quarter. So we'll just have we'll be producing more product home standby generator product in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. That will sequentially drive more shipments. And then on the clean energy side, we'll be shipping as that builds up, we'll be shipping more clean energy as well. So that's the main reasons for the ramp, higher fourth quarter versus maybe normal seasonally.
Mike Halloran: That makes sense. And then just some thoughts on the distribution side for the clean energy piece, the battery piece. Maybe just more context to how you think that's progressing, competitive position for the wins you're seeing in the marketplace versus the broader marketplace? And any context around that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean, we've had the products have been, I mean, incredibly well received. And we're sending leads, a lot of leads into the market, which one of the best ways that we've learned from our home standby experience is to create really good engagement and alignment with channel partners, is giving them sales leads, giving them an opportunity to win in the marketplace. So that's been incredibly well received. And I think that's been the, for us anyway, a great way to get the conversation started. It's the icebreaker, right? We talked about it on the prepared remarks, Mike, the pacing of solar installs really took a hit in Q2. It's just the pullback in a lot of the in fact, you go out to California and some other parts of the East Coast where solar installs are pretty popular, they actually deemed those kinds of activities nonessential. So it was largely shut down, like a hard shutdown, like people weren't even answering their phones. And for us, because we're the new kid on the block, this is largely a ground game, right? So in the early days here, we've got to engage people face-to-face. We've got to show them the product. They've got to touch and feel it, see our selling system, our PowerPlay CE selling system. There's just nothing there's really no substitute for face-to-face, that transfer of emotion of selling. And so you can try to do a lot of things with a video conferencing call, and we've done a lot of that. And we shifted to it virtually where we can with training and everything else. But we still need that ground game. And so we're encouraged by the fact that it's starting to get back on track here, but we just, we lost some momentum in the second quarter, unfortunately. And we really had a head of steam coming out of Q1. I felt like we really were the kind of world was our oyster with this thing and then the pandemic hit. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing early days. Our Sunnova partnership, we called this out on prepared remarks, that's been really encouraging. It's a great group of people in the industry that are incredibly knowledgeable about the industry. We're learning a lot from them. And I've been in close contact with their CEO and the rest of their team. And we're continuing to expand our partnerships and build on kind of the early wins we've had here. But we're really bullish on clean energy for the long term. This is really a long term play. And it's really starting to show us a much clearer path around the changes that are coming, the macro changes that are coming in the grid, the decentralization. And we've got a line of sight on some pretty cool stuff here, both in our product pipeline as well as just some thoughts strategically around where we can go with this in the future as we continue to diversify the company here, into more of an energy technology, energy solutions type of play.
Operator: And your next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning. And congrats on all the success here. I wanted to extend on the last point about really, I think alluding to potential for new business models around the decentralization of the grid. I'm wondering where you are in terms of that being a theory versus being tangible ideas. And ESS is obviously a tangible idea that's manifesting right now. But just curious if there are other specific things that you're working toward along the lines of the way you introduced DSS into the portfolio?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, it's a great question, Chris. And it seems like every day, there almost isn't a day that goes by where our learnings are creating critical insights into some opportunities around exactly, as you mentioned, new business models and new opportunities for Generac and for as we think in particular about look, our business. We're a legacy kind of power equipment company, right? That's where our 60-year history has been centered, internal combustion engine technology, which is a great technology, don't get me wrong, and it's had its own amazing advances. But I think you can probably make the argument that there's a sunset on some of that technology. And so our move into energy storage, our move into electrification, battery technologies, the software platforms and the amazing I mean, this stuff is high functioning stuff, the artificial intelligence and the algorithms and everything else that goes into this. We've been introduced to that in a big way through our acquisitions here and frankly, through the pipeline, our M&A pipeline that Mike and team continue to work on here. We see an incredible future. And I think we're in a super enviable position that in this industry, and I'm talking more broadly in the clean energy industry, we've got a balance sheet that gives us every right to go after some of this stuff in a very meaningful way. And I think there's some really cool things that we could do in the future here. Timing around things, again, we won't speak to specifics on that. But I'll call out one thing we announced in the quarter here. This partnership with Virtual Peaker, which I think is kind of a glimpse into some of the future, virtual power plants and where we can go, where the industry is going with distributed energy resources, DERs, and distributed energy resource management DERMS. They're software platforms but you aggregate these blocks of load. And so in the clean energy space, most people have been considering these blocks of load to be storage items or wind power or other clean sources. We look at natural gas generators, which in their own right, are quite clean. We look at those as tremendous DER potential. And as the number one producer of backup gas generators in the world, we're extremely excited about the potential marrying of the technology here, the combination of all of this into something that just kind of penciling out could be incredibly meaningful. I mean, the electric utility industry, just in the U.S. is a $4 trillion annual business. And that's going to change through decentralization and through the mega trends that we've talked about around the Grid 2.0, if you will. And as we think about that, and as we could think about Generac and our brand and our capabilities and our competencies, we think that, boy, that's a space for us. And that's a place that we can play. And that's a place where we can really, I think, have an impact. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it.
Operator: Our next question is from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners.
Philip Shen: Hey guys, thanks for the question. Congrats on the quarter and the outlook. And as a follow-up on that last question, just a little bit of a kind of nitpicky. Well, not nitpicky, but just a detailed question. Have you guys started changing contracts or updating contracts with your customers to give you more flexibility in new revenue generation sources? And if not, when do you expect to maybe start to do that? Or perhaps you're doing that with the new contracts, but haven't gone back to the old contracts to give you guys the ability to maybe turn engines on to meet capacity needs from the grid, for example?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. On a go-forward basis, that's certainly the case, Phil. We look at as we think about these blocks of power, right? Just think of a generator as a block of power being able to be used in a fashion by the customer, by the utility, by an aggregate or third party, maybe by the company at some point in the future. New contracts and new the language expressed around how these products are being positioned in the market. And there's some nuances there that are both technical in nature and then contractual in nature. Technical from a product standpoint in that if you're going to run a product like a natural gas generator outside of an emergency, so for non-emergency purposes, there's actually some different levels of permitting requirements around the tail pipe emissions and some things there. So that certainly, in terms of it's not necessarily a change in a contract as much as it is a change in the certification of the product. And so new products are being certified to a nonemergency standard in a lot of cases. And we're having that type of dialogue with customers so they understand that those products can be deployed in that manner. And there's still certain limitations on that in terms of the hours and the warranties that go with those products. So all of that is rapidly developing on a go-backward basis, so on a look back basis. It's a different conversation depending on each customer and how they've configured their systems historically. I think, at least as we think about it today, this is definitely a future-looking discussion, but I think that we do need to figure out what the path looks like going backward. And we also need to figure out, quite frankly, just what do the economics look like, right? What does the business model look like? Who participates in what level and to what degree. And there's going to obviously, there's potential savings, not only for the end customer, but for kind of every person in the value chain. So we're kind of penciling that out. And we're talking. As I said, there's a lot of people in this industry who have looked at this over the years, who have done it to some degree, actually, even with generators. There's a couple of companies out there that have done it. So as we talk to different people and we learn more about this. And again, the guys at Sunnova have been really helpful and that's because some of the leadership on that team has been involved in this for a long time. We're all starting to kind of center in on a couple of different business models that could work. And it's going to be really interesting to see how this plays out over the next 12 to 24 months. But I think we'll be able to give you more kind of clarity around that as it develops.
Philip Shen: Great. Very exciting. Shifting gears to your 24 kilowatt engine. I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on the timing of when that could be available at scale? And I'm guessing because it's a higher powered engine instead of selling the 22, you might be selling more of the 24. So and I'm imagining there's a better margin profile that's associated with the 24-kilowatt. And so with that better margin profile, just curious on how you might use that margin. Do you think you would use that to go from 80% market share to even more, with one of your peers declaring bankruptcy? Or do you think we should just look for just margin support and expansion even for home standby going forward?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. No, it's a great question, Phil. And I'm super excited about the 24 kilowatt. It's a beast of a machine. It is a cool it's our largest air cooled generator. It's built on the same platform as the 22, but we have a new alternator that we've put into the family, which is the business end of the machine. The engine is actually roughly the same. We were actually limited. We were alternator-limited in terms of output on the previous platform. So the engine had some more room in it. That engine makes just tremendous power in a compact footprint. But the alternator, the frame size of the alternator was we were kind of limited to what we had to work with, which and again, not to get too technical, but the size frame was just too small to get us above 22. So we invested heavily in a brand-new engine platform over the last three years, and that's in machine tooling as well. When you spool up a new alternator, it's not just the design engineering investment. It's the machine tool because we have to make this at scale. And you're exactly right. We would anticipate there's going to be a portion of the market we've kind of modeled it two ways. One, there's going to be a portion of the market that migrates from 22 KW on the air-cooled side to 24. And then there'll be we also believe there'll be a portion of the market that currently today is buying some of our smaller and liquid-cooled products. So in particular, homes in Florida and Texas, where we've just seen tremendous demand for better power, you have a lot of air conditioning loads. And whenever you have a lot of air conditioning loads, you have a need for a high starting motor starting capabilities, which leads to higher kilowatt machines. That typically means that moves you from an air-cooled platform to a liquid-cooled platform, which is a sizable bump in terms of price point. So and as a result, it generally makes that a smaller market because affordability just is not as great on that end of the market. So we think there's a cool opportunity here to take that and to go after it both ways. In terms of availability, it's available Monday. We start making them Monday. We've been maybe holding this one in our hip pocket a little bit. And we've been working on it for a while. Competitively, we think that while we've got great market share, there's an opportunity to go and our mission here has been to grow the market. And alongside that, we've just been able to continue to grow our share of the market. But when you're the leader in the market and you take all the innovation and things that we do and you continue to push on that, I think it just it continues to fall into kind of our lap in terms of share. And so you're right that we've got some competitors who are maybe struggling a little bit more on some other fronts. And we think there's probably an opportunity there to go after not only distribution, but just again, just broader share with the increased product offering.
Operator: And your next question is from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse: Good morning. Thank you very much for taking our questions. Of your 6,700 dealers, can you just talk about the percentage that are opting to sell the clean energy solution? How has that trended over the last couple of quarters? And can you talk about the geographies? Is that really just California and Hawaii at this point? Or are you kind of seeing it across the country?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's Mark, it's actually really broad-based. And again, I think it follows the overall trends that we're seeing in terms of the interest level in the category. So the growth has been broad-based. Obviously, as we called out, California has represented about 250 of the 650 new dealers that we've added over the last 12 months to get to that 6,700. So California does have an outsized position. But of the 400 other dealers, it's pretty well diversified. To answer the other part of your question about the number of dealers that are also offering clean energy products, it's still relatively small. That part of the thesis has played out a little slower than we would have liked it to. And I think it's just there's a couple of reasons why, but our traditional legacy customer for home standby in that dealer is an electrician, it's an electrical contractor. And frankly, they've just been a little bit slower to move on the shift to more clean energy technology products. Where we have had a lot of really great success is signing new partners for our clean energy initiatives, so solar dealers on a direct basis. The exciting thing is that almost every single solar channel partner that we sign is actually really interested in adding home standby generators to their product line, because their customers are asking for a system that can be resilient over time. And the challenge with storage still to this point is economically, it's just not a viable option in a multiday type of outage. And so you really need to augment that system with a generator. And so these guys are super excited. I think it gives us a unique competitive advantage in that we can offer basically a home energy system. It doesn't matter if you're talking about a gas generator or a storage system or an energy monitoring system. It really is a we were kind of thinking about we're trying to think about our dealers going forward as home energy consultants, right? We wanted to think more broadly than just backup power or just solar. We want to think about, again, this feeds really right back into that distributed generation play and that decentralized grid that we're talking about in the future. We think that the way that's going to get served is through a channel of home energy consultants. And that's going to look different than it looks today. But we're I think we're headed down the right path. It's just going to probably take some time to materialize.
Mark Strouse: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, kind of a high-level question on margins. Going back to your Analyst Day from about a year ago, you kind of put out a 21% target for EBITDA in 2022. You're trending above that this year. I understand there's a mix issue this year. But just given the strength in home standby and the restructuring for the C&I business, do you think that 21% is kind of the still the right bogey to be targeting? Or do you think there could be potential upside there?
York Ragen: Yes, this is York. I think, obviously, when the C&I business does come back on the back end of the next cycle, that will have an impact on margins. I think the outsized impact on margins today is because of that heavy home standby mix and the declines on the C&I side and the international side. So I think the 21% still feels right once the cycle returns. But we will be updating that, obviously, periodically as we run our long-range planning models and have a view toward what do margins look like three years from now on an updated basis. But I think once the cycle returns, that 21% still feels about right.
Operator: And your next question is from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America.
Ross Gilardi: Good Morning, guys. I just had a couple of questions. Just on your clean energy guide, clearly, you've got huge opportunity longer term, which you focused on. But given what happened in the second quarter, I mean, how long of a putt do you feel like it is to reach the low end of your guide? You have about 125 to 150, do you feel like you have visibility on that? Or do you have to make like a lot of progress in the next two quarters just on order intake?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So we've actually got a we don't talk about backlog much in our businesses, but we actually have a really strong backlog position in that business. So we've already taken a lot of orders in. What we saw there was a shift in shipments from Q2 out. So largely what the guide contemplates for us is that we're just some of that stuff is pushing into the back half. Now numerically, you can look at it and I'm as much of a skeptic as anybody. And with our own teams here on back-end loaded forecast, I would much prefer to see a more steady ramp but this is the way it's playing out. And as I look, I'm one of these people, I got to see it for myself. So I've been listening in on our clean energy business sales pipeline calls because I just want to hear. I just I have to hear the tone in the voices. And I got to I even pipe in and ask a couple questions. But I'm really encouraged by what I'm hearing because the team is look, like I said before, it's a ground game. We've got to get out there in front of customers. That's starting to open up again. Could things back up if you get a second wave? Maybe. But I think because of that backlog and because the solar installs are happening and we track registrations every day. I was really encouraged. We saw registrations on Sunday this past week, coming out of our registration reports Monday morning, which is great. We haven't seen Sunday registrations yet. So that tells me that the installed base is actually working over the weekend to get caught up. So that I think that's a sign that's encouraging, just little things like that. We're putting it all together. But make no bones about it. It's still a steep ramp. The team is hanging in there. We are coming in at the lower end of that original guidance at 125-megawatt hours as opposed to the 150. But I think the sales pipeline that we have visibility to, the backlog we have visibility to, I think it's very doable.
York Ragen: And the trends on
Aaron Jagdfeld: And the trends.
York Ragen: On leads and
Aaron Jagdfeld: The trends on leads and activations are, that's very supportive.
Ross Gilardi: And then I got a two-pronged follow-up. I mean, are you losing any leads because in the process of customers shopping, they are actually realizing that a home standby generator is what they actually want? Which is that would be a high class problem, but you guys have said all along that you want to buy a generator as a backup power solution. And buying an energy storage system is really more of an ROI and cost savings type of investment. So do you think the consumer's actually tapping into that? Is that part of the reason why your home standby business is so strong? And then I'm just curious on competition on the clean energy side, what you're seeing from the incumbents. It seems like there's a lot of new products out there. Are you seeing any copy cats on your turnkey approach that's really focused on lightweight, ease of use in kind of your direct marketing approach?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Those are great questions, Ross. I mean, the market there, it is interesting. So we're doing these infomercials, right? We're playing clean energy infomercials. And we have people calling asking for a home standby because they see the brand. And the brand has become so strong and synonymous with a backup generator that it just the impressions that we're getting with the brand are just leading people to ask about standby. That's a percentage of the calls we get. The people who are calling though about clean energy are pretty fixated on a storage solution. If they have if they understand what we're telling them in those infomercials, they get that it's a different type of product. That's what they want. And in some cases, I would say it's more of maybe somebody who might have been looking at one of the competitive solution sets out there for energy storage that then sees our infomercial. And that's what kind of spurs into action and to call us. Clearly, though, and I've listened to calls, as we listen to our call centers, and we're actually bringing that call centers in-house for clean energy here. That starts next month in August, in a couple days here because we just, what we're finding is it's a very technical sale. It's just a complex sale. So we've tried to use outside call centers. Our conversion rates are too low relative to what we think we should be seeing. So we're going to bring that in-house, and we're ramping up a team of people internally here to take those calls. So we're going to have an opportunity to refine our messaging a lot quicker. But in the calls I have been listening to and that the team has been listening to, yes, there are people who sometimes come to the conclusion that what they really just want is backup power. And maybe the clean part of that, which is for a lot of people, they're thinking about saving money on their energy bills, that maybe that's a lesser goal for them than simply having a constant source of power in the event of a longer-term outage. So while there are these are concentric circles and there's some overlap in the two markets, we still see them as two separate markets. But it's we have definitely had people to tip over into it. And again, like you said, it's not a bad result. I mean, in the end, we sell them a home standby. It's not a bad result. So.
York Ragen: I think there are cases where they want a quote for both, and then they make a decision. And that's why I think the solar guys want to be dealers of home generators as well.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Exactly, yes. And then the competitive response, Ross, just to hit the second part of the question and move on here. But I think right now, everybody in the industry has kind of got their own path, right? So we're still the new kids on the block. I'm not sure everybody is convinced our path or our approach is going to be the one that everybody picks. But one thing we have centered on, and I said it in our prepared remarks. But a lot of the initial engagement with not only channel partners but also homeowners and others, they're looking for a whole home solution. And our system is beautifully situated for that type of application. We've got the largest inverter, so you can put the most power across the inverter, which means you can power a lot more things in your home with our system than you can maybe a competing system. And the modularity in our ESS allows for people to step up and add additional modules to cover more things in their home. And then some of the things we've got in our pipeline going forward around load control and the integration in the much more tightly integrated backup generator pieces are really going to lend itself beautifully to kind of a whole home energy system that's got kind of long-term resiliency alongside giving somebody the capability to reduce their energy costs. So I think the way we're positioning ourselves, we believe is the right place to position ourselves. And frankly, is somewhat unique, uniquely available to us based on kind of the competencies and capabilities we have. I know that even if others wanted to do it that they could do it either easily or do it at all, maybe for that matter.
York Ragen: And the lead gen, no one is necessarily being a copycat on our lead gens.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Not at this point. There's people who have talked about doing some lead gen, but nobody is out there putting infomercials on TV and spending millions like we are.
Operator: And your next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. I'm wondering if you could talk about with your standby business, we have a point of light, if you will, with the distributors. Can we have a similar conversation across your channels for the battery storage business? How many folks are active PowerPlay users or however you want to frame it as we look at how much success you're having in the field with the installers.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So Jerry, we probably start need to start talking about that a little bit more, more pointedly. So thank you for bringing that up. It's about 500 so far is what we've got in terms of dealer base pulled together for our clean energy business directly. Again, there's a little bit of overlap between the two channels, but not a ton at this point. I think the introduction of the PowerPlay CE tool, I would say, we have a lower penetration of PowerPlay CE usage at this point with that dealer base than we do with our traditional legacy dealer, the 6,700 dealers selling home standby. We have a higher percentage of those dealers using PowerPlay than we do in the PowerPlay CE clean world at this point. That's really just a rollout and training thing. It's just going to take time to ramp them. They're brand new to it. We're brand new to it. We have been doing some refining of the PowerPlay CE product. We've got some really good feedback from the dealer partners on the usage of that early on. We want to make it a platform that they can use for their business. We're kind of in terms of where we're targeting, for total dealers for the full year here, we're kind of looking at about we think probably about 1,200 dealers is where we would like to be.
York Ragen: Using PowerPlay.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Using PowerPlay CE.
York Ragen: And I know we've trained over 3,000 solar installers to at least install and sell our products, of which we want to have about 1,200 using the CE systems.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's a work in process, though. But look, if we know anything about what we've done with home standby, it's point of light matter. That is a strategy that works. The omnichannel approach works. And we're going to use that same approach in this clean energy market because you've got to have representation everywhere. And so we think that this is again, it's a ground game. I keep saying that, but it absolutely is, and we've built that ground game over a 20-year period with home standby and been very successful with that. And we believe that the playbook is relatively similar for clean energy.
Jerry Revich: And Aaron, you mentioned that the outside call center conversion rates were lower than you experienced in home standby lower than you expected. Can you just expand on that point? Are you not getting the conversion from the call-in into a qualified lead? Or is it a situation where once the installer is on-site the installer can't close the sale?
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's the conversion to a qualified lead. So we get an inbound call, and there's a percentage of those calls that drop out immediately based on qualification. But then the so there's a conversion factor. And when we look at historically how home standby kind of over the seven or eight years we've been doing that, how that kind of conversion rate has matured. And we look at where we're at, even early days with clean energy, we just feel like we should better. And as we dig in and start listening on the calls, what we're finding is it's just a very technical sale, a very complex sale. So a lot of pieces there. There's a lot to explain to a homeowner. And we believe that we're just going to need a higher grade of salesperson effectively, who's got some really good system knowledge, some really good knowledge of kind of how things not only work technically, but just to help the homeowner better understand what this product does and what they should expect from it. So we're bringing that in-house. And again, those conversion rates have been pretty low out of the gate. Which we didn't it wasn't completely unexpected. We normally would see kind of as we onboard certain new dealers, you have the conflux of new dealer coming on board, plus a complex sale. We're new to the market in terms of our brand translating to it. So we kind of expected low conversions. We just, we're impatient people here. I'll be very honest. I mean, it's just, we just don't have a lot of patience for stuff. So we try to instill a sense of urgency. And if something is not working, why sit there and wait for it to work? Let's do something about it. So we're moving that call center in-house. And I think we're going to have better success with that.
Operator: Our next question is from Jed Dorsheimer with Canaccord Genuity.
Jed Dorsheimer: Hi. Thanks. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I do have a question on the resi side of things. Was there a particular model or SKU or size that jumped out as in terms of highest seller? Or was it pretty even across that distribution? And then I do have a question on the clean energy side, too.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Jed, from that standpoint, the 22-kilowatt has been our workhorse in the fleet. But everything has been strong, frankly, every single part of the product line. I would say probably indexing a little bit more on the higher end of the product line simply because of the strength in the Southeast that we called out specifically. Again, higher air conditioning loads, the South and the Southeast have been very good markets for us. And as such, because they have greater power need that tends to I would say probably it's maybe skewing a little bit more toward that whole home solution in the higher KW air-cooled and lower KW liquid-cooled products.
Jed Dorsheimer: Got it. And then on clean energy, two questions. So the first is you have a pretty clear conflict mineral policy. And so I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the sourcing of minerals around the battery pack? And then second, as you look at where things are going with a whole home solution, for example, in the combination of the pack as well the battery backup with say a 22-kilowatt generator. What are you thinking about in terms of control system to monitor loads and automatically switch back and forth? I didn't see that as being available, but maybe I'm wrong there.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. No, great questions. So first on the conflict minerals, yes, we're working with our partners on supply chain to make sure that they're fully compliant. So I don't have all the nuances of that, but I know the team has got that front and center. We made sure that as we qualify new companies, that's a really important thing that we have to make sure we're compliant with and that our partners are compliant with. And that, by the way, is no small task, as I think everybody in basically any industry can probably attest to, maybe even more so in the clean energy industry, given some of the minerals that go into these products. On the product side of things, your question there with kind of an integrated, fully integrated system, the platform. You're right, today, load management so we have home energy management. So our HEM system, which, by the way, I should say, that's going to ship bundled in with every 24-kilowatt generator. That will be the first product, the first legacy product where we're packaging HEMs in as a standard feature, which is pretty cool. So I think we have somebody asked the question previously about the differentiation there. And we're actually going to package HEMs with every one of those machines, which is I'm super excited about that because it just gives us a ton of data. I mean the data that comes at us from HEMs is so rich and so exciting. But from load control, you're right, today, not in the product available set, will be tomorrow. We have in our road map some really cool stuff coming on load control. And alongside of the actual physical elements of load control, right? So the capability to actually control each circuit individually or you could go even further with that strategy down to an actual appliance-level strategy in terms of control. But it's also the software that goes with that, right? The brains behind the system, right? So that we can really create a smart load control system, not just one that there's some systems out there in the marketplace that frankly don't have the intelligence we believe that are going to be required going forward. So we want to make sure that our system isn't just a hardware-based approach, but also an integrated hardware-software based approach that works seamlessly with our storage system and our home energy management system. So kind of we want to make it a one-stop kind of turnkey solution and we're getting close to that from a launch point.
York Ragen: I mean, as a generator manufacturer, we're experts in power electronics and load control. And then you couple that with the Neurio Technology guys in Vancouver, who that's what they do.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And it's been incredibly helpful. I mean, our teams here, we're used to working with codes and standards around electrical connections. And so our guys have been we've been working very, very well together with the teams from Neurio and Pika to develop these solution sets.
Operator: And your final question comes from William Grippin with UBS.
William Grippin: Great. Just a couple of quick ones for me. The clean energy supply chain ramp in Vietnam, just wondering how that's progressing? And are you still expecting margin to be in line with the corporate average on that business?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. The supply chain ramp has been going well. I would say that there are a couple of our new product things that we've been kicking around here on the phone were probably a little bit, a few months delayed because of some of the things with the pandemic that have kind of created some challenges there. But in terms of moving to the supply chain, the new supply chain that we talked about, that's going very well. In fact, again, we've got a really good line of sight to those corporate average margins by the time we exit the year here. And we believe we're going to be kind of right on top of breakeven for that clean energy business by the end of the year and profitable as we exit the end of the year. So all of that's intact. And we continue to look at how we can continue to expand the supply chain as well, because if we think about the future here and what this could be, we're going to need more and bigger partnerships to bridge to where we think we can go in the next three to five years.
William Grippin: Got it. And then are you able to share how many megawatt hours of clean energy projects were shipped in the second quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It was down sequentially. That's how kind of we kind of spelled it out. So rather than kind of go kind of quarter-to-quarter here with that pacing, we just are with a discrete number. We said it was down sequentially, but we're still sticking with the guidance range, albeit the lower end of the guidance range of 125-megawatt hours. But I think as you follow the industry as well on this and just that solar install capability that got really hit hard in Q2. Thankfully, it's coming back online. We have some really good evidence that it is. But we think the third and fourth quarters are going to be are going to be a lot of we're going to see a lot of growth there in getting these systems out there.
Operator: And I'll hand the call back over to Mike Harris for closing remarks.
Mike Harris: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning, and we look forward to discussing our third quarter earnings results with you in late October. Thank you again, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you again for joining us today. This does conclude today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Harris, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Harris: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available on our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Overall, net sales were a record for the first quarter and met expectations, led by strong core growth in residential products of approximately 9%. Relative to expectations, home standby shipments came in well ahead of our prior forecast, continuing the strength seen over the past several quarters, including strong demand in California. Also, we are pleased that shipments of our PWRcell energy storage system met our expectations after the first full quarter of its commercial launch in December. This strong performance within residential products was mostly offset by lower-than-expected shipments for domestic mobile products and continued weakness in international markets following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has triggered a significant decline in demand in certain end markets that we serve. On a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 1% during the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the very strong prior year first quarter, where overall revenue growth was 18%. Core sales growth for the quarter declined approximately 3% against the robust prior year comparison of approximately 15% growth. Gross margin expanded 170 basis points compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.1% as both exceeded our expectations primarily due to favorable mix from higher-than-expected shipments of residential products. Before discussing first quarter results in more detail, it's hard to overstate the impact that COVID-19 pandemic has had in creating major economic uncertainty across the globe so far in 2020, including weaker demand and supply chain constraints, along with the unknown impacts from a variety of far-reaching government actions. Our team has been incredibly proactive and diligent in evaluating and responding to the impact on the business to date and was planning for various scenarios that may unfold during the months and quarters ahead. This includes assembling specific task forces to address the variety of changing conditions on a daily basis across the business, including impacts on employee health and safety, customer demand, production and our supply chain. As the events from this pandemic continue to evolve, we are focused first and foremost on preventative measures to address the health, safety and well-being of employees, customers, suppliers and the communities across the world where we operate and do business. We have eliminated all corporate travel, restricted vendors to visitors to our facilities, implemented social distancing practices and enhanced cleaning protocols, along with other preventative efforts across all facilities, including providing face masks and other sanitization supplies and equipment. Work from home programs have been implemented with our office teams globally, and we are taking a variety of additional measures for employees at our manufacturing and distribution facilities to ensure their health and safety, including temperature testing and physical barriers for situations where appropriate social distancing is difficult to achieve. We've also instituted more flexible policies for all employees relating to sick leave, absences and furloughs. Finally, we are closely watching legislative and other regulatory updates on a daily basis to remain compliant with local, state and national government mandates and recommended actions. From a demand perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic is relatively is negatively impacting several areas of our business, most notably across a number of the end markets for our C&I products, both domestically and internationally. However, while demand for our residential products may not be completely immune to the weaker consumer spending environment that is likely to result from the macroeconomic weakness, there are some positive trends developing that are very encouraging. The uncertainty over the magnitude and duration of a global recession will likely have an impact on all of our product categories, but to varying degrees. In particular, the combination of a collapse in oil prices, alongside the cancellation of many events such as festivals and concerts as well as an impending slowdown in construction activity, will significantly impact demand for our domestic mobile products as national rental customers have dramatically reduced their capital spending, given lower fleet utilization rates. Our domestic C&I stationary products sold through our North American distributor channel are also expected to be negatively impacted from the potential downturn in nonresidential construction activity. Additionally, we are also assessing the potential risk of our telecom customers extending their pause in capital spending on backup power in the near-term in order to better optimize liquidity for the current environment. However, the importance of maintaining uptime for the country's wireless communications infrastructure is being highlighted by this crisis, and could translate to faster penetration of backup power by the carriers and other operators of these wireless networks in the long run. As we have previously discussed, our International business had begun to slow in the second half of last year. And with the COVID-19 pandemic reaching the European continent in early March, we began to see fresh signs of further slowing in our International segment, which is expected to continue for the remainder of this year. Although demand in Europe and Asia has sharply declined, we have seen less of an impact at this point in the Latin American region. But as the Mexican peso has rapidly weakened against the U.S. dollar, we expect this volatility could result in some amount of uncertainty in that region as well in the quarters ahead. However, while we anticipate declines overall for our C&I products on a global basis for the remainder of the year, we are seeing some very encouraging trends in the important residential products part of our business. Historically, residential products have tended to be defensive in nature. As we have seen a number of examples over the last 25 years where demand for home standby and portable generators has decoupled from broader economic trends as they are largely driven by power outages. The aging and under-invested electrical grid in the U.S. continues to be more vulnerable to unpredictable and weather-related events, causing elevated power outages across the country, including the unique situation developing more recently in California around public safety shutoffs to prevent wildfires. On top of the growing concerns around power outages is the fact that a vast majority of the U.S. population is now facing some form of shelter-in-place order. And we believe that is causing an added premium to be placed on residential backup power as people work from home, school from home, shop from home and entertain from home. Additionally, as a recent entrant into the clean energy market, we expect this to be a significant long-term growth opportunity for Generac. Although in the near term, there has been a notable pullback in solar installation activity, we continue to see increasing attachment rates for energy storage that exceed original market projections, which is helping to mitigate the reduced solar install trends. Longer term, the improving economics of solar plus storage, coupled with added resiliency concerns from homeowners, should further benefit our clean energy efforts. Regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the supply side of the business, we are also focused on maintaining our operations to the extent possible as the products and services we provide to customers and end users are both essential and critical. Recall, our biggest concern related to COVID-19 at the time of our last earnings call on February 13th was with our suppliers in China and neighboring countries in Asia. While we did experience some disruptions in our Chinese supply chain during the first quarter, it was relatively temporary and now is essentially back to normal levels. Beyond Asia, however, we are monitoring changing conditions and disruptions very closely with suppliers across Europe, India and North America and have developed mitigation actions, which, thus far, have limited the impacts to our operations. Regarding our own manufacturing and distribution facilities. Our all locations are operational today, with the exception of our facility in Kolkata, India, which houses our relatively small C&I generator business in that country. However, changes to our operations has been, and will likely continue to be, a very fluid situation. In particular, we have been experiencing higher-than-normal absenteeism at many of our facilities around the globe, which has created challenges in maintaining consistent output levels. Our operations teams have responded through a combination of labor pooling across facilities, unique work schedules as well as overtime. And to date, we have largely been able to meet all of our customer commitments. We have also been evaluating the need to right size production levels at certain facilities across the globe to adjust for anticipated demand changes as well as working to develop contingency plans for several key residential products, raw material warehousing and distribution facilities. In response to slowing demand trends in specific areas of our business, we're implementing a variety of prudent cost reduction actions in addition to exploring additional measures, so the severity of the pandemic situation worsen in the quarters ahead. In particular, with our C&I products, we have already begun taking specific restructuring actions within our operations for domestic mobile products and our international businesses that sell primarily into Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions. These actions include work furloughs, hiring freezes and certain headcount reductions as well as reduced incentive compensation. Across the enterprise, we are also adjusting marketing and promotional spending to align more closely with lower expected revenue levels and reprioritizing resources focusing on product cost of projects. Overall, we believe these actions will reduce operating expenses by approximately $25 million to $30 million across the business for the remainder of 2020, with an estimated impact to adjusted EBITDA margin of between one and 1.5 percentage points, to offset the operating deleverage from the lower expected sales volumes. Now discussing our first quarter results in more detail. Shipments of home standby generators during the quarter once again increased at a very strong rate compared to the prior year, benefiting from the elevated outage activity and awareness in recent years as well as a significant increase in demand in California that also exceeded our expectations. Several key demand metrics that we monitor closely for home standby continued to be strong during the first quarter. Activations grew at a solid rate compared to the prior year, led by robust growth in installations in the west region driven by California, which was up over 5 times the prior year levels. The Midwest, South Central and Canadian regions were also strong. In-home consultations, or IHCs, grew significantly during the first quarter compared to the prior year, led again by considerable strength in California, but we also saw encouraging growth trends in several other parts of the U.S. Although power outage severity was lower in the current quarter relative to the prior year, on a trailing 12-month basis, outages were still very favorable to the long-term baseline average. We also ended the first quarter with over 6,500 residential dealers, an increase of approximately 500 or 9% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2019. This includes a significant increase in California, ramping up to over 400 dealers at the end of the quarter from approximately 150 dealers at the end of the prior year first quarter. In response to the current COVID-19 situation, we are actively working to convert our traditional in-home consultation process into one that can largely be conducted remotely, which we are now referring to as a virtual home consultation, or VHC. We have spent the last 45 days rolling out the VHC process to our dealers through aggressive communication and training. And as they have transitioned to it, they are experiencing similar close rates and sales cycle times in relation to the in-home visits they previously conducted. More recently, early in the second quarter, these key demand metrics for home standby have continued to be very strong, with outage severity picking up considerably and with activations in our new VHC process continuing to show strength. Specifically, we are encouraged that we have not seen evidence of any slowdown thus far in the demand for or installation of these products. And although while still early, the strength in-home standby demand appears to be accelerating further here in April. There have been some notable outages recently, including 1.4 million utility customers in the southern region of the U.S. alone last week. VHCs have spiked in April and are tracking at roughly double the levels compared to the prior year. Part of the strength we are experiencing can certainly be attributed to the recent pickup in outage activity, but based on the widespread nature of the VHC activity, we believe that it can also be attributed to the millions of people that are now working and learning from home, thereby, creating a heightened sense of awareness of the importance of backup power. The market for energy storage and energy monitoring systems continues to develop quickly through a combination of changing regulations, advancements in technologies, improving economics and the increased resiliency provided by these products. Recall that our Pika and Neurio acquisitions enabled us to bring an efficient and intelligent energy saving solution to the market in December called PWRcell, which we believe will position Generac as a key participant going forward. Q1 represented the first full quarter of commercial shipments of PWRcell unit of scale, which met our relatively high expectations. Despite the COVID-19 situation, we're making excellent progress in building out our dealer installation base, ramping our technical service capabilities, optimizing our supply chain and reducing our system costs. We are also making important strides in growing this nascent market through targeted advertising, lead generation and virtual in-home sales capabilities. Our new clean energy infomercial that launched in mid-January continues to be well received and is driving good lead volume, feeding into our recently launched selling system called PowerPlay CE, a proprietary lead management and sales tool, similar to the one developed to our legacy home standby generator market. Our current 2020 outlook for clean energy remains very encouraging as we're still expecting a further significant ramp in shipments of these products as the year progresses. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on slowing the pace of solar installations in the U.S., particularly, here in the second quarter, we are modestly lowering our expectations for shipments of energy storage systems for the remainder of the year, but we still expect to ship between 125- to 150-megawatt hours of residential product. Our updated outlook remains significantly ahead of the expectations we laid out during our Investor Day last September, which reflects our success in the marketplace to date as well as the increasing level of solar plus storage attachment rates the industry is experiencing, in part driven by homeowner concerns over backup power. We have good visibility with regard to these products for the remainder of the year through existing orders and our sales pipeline. While the impact of the pandemic has resulted in some softening in the market for energy storage for 2020, we believe the long-term drivers remain firmly in place, as installations of these systems are forecasted to experience exceptional growth over the next several years. With regard to our C&I products, domestic shipments declined during the first quarter as compared to the prior year. As expected, shipments to national telecom customers declined at a considerable rate on a year-over-year basis, as these customers had previously indicated a slowdown in capital spending for backup generators, based on the timing of installation projects. Recall that demand trends with telecom national customers can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of capital deployment and project planning cycles. Also, shipments of mobile products to national rental account customers declined significantly in the quarter, primarily due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the collapse in oil prices. Demand for mobile equipment was already softer entering the quarter as many of our national rental customers were already deferring some capital spending. And the sudden stopped economic activity in March forced many of them to further and dramatically reduce equipment purchases. Lastly, shipments of C&I stationary generators through our North American distributor channel were slightly up compared to the prior year, as this channel continued to gain share in the North American industrial backup power market. With respect to the international side of our business, which is predominantly C&I products, we continue to experience a challenging environment during the first quarter, that worsened considerably during the latter half of the period. Revenues declined approximately 10% on a core basis compared to the prior year, with the decline primarily driven by a sharp drop in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on certain key regions of the world, which magnified the slower economic growth and geopolitical headwinds that were already being experienced in recent quarters. The Latin American region, however, was relatively stable during the first quarter, and grew modestly with the benefit of a large project shipped during the period. As we continue to assess the impact of the global pandemic on our business, we believe that our C&I products are likely to be the most negatively impacted part of our business. This is due to a combination of the recessionary impact on non-residential construction activity, the expected further deferral of telecom capital spending, the dramatic decline in oil prices leading to lower rental equipment utilization rates, and an overall sharp decline in macroeconomic activity internationally. As previously discussed, we believe our residential products will be relatively less impacted as increased outage activity, heightened anxiety over the need for backup power during these shelter-in-place times, growth opportunities in California and the increasing penetration of our new clean energy products should help to mitigate any general economic weakness that may occur in residential investment. In closing, I want to highlight that Generac is in the very fortunate position of having a strong balance sheet and liquidity. This financial strength gives us the flexibility and confidence to continue to execute on our long-term strategy and to remain focused on providing innovative products and services that are essential to the safety and security of homes, businesses and critical infrastructure across the globe. We believe we have a unique opportunity to be particularly aggressive during this time of crisis in pursuing new commercial business opportunities, to gain market share as well as continuing to build a robust M&A pipeline to accelerate our powering our future strategic plan. Generac is built for moments like this, with our long history in supporting customers through difficult times. In the face of hurricanes, floods, fires and other natural disasters that caused power outages, our teams have proven themselves to be agile. And they know how to employ a healthy sense of urgency and solid decision-making to manage difficult situations. We are very confident that once we get past this pandemic, our future growth prospects will be as compelling as ever, driven by the overall megatrends and powerful macro secular drivers for our business. With that, I'd now like the call turn over to York to provide further details on the first quarter results. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Looking at our first quarter 2020 results in more detail. Net sales for the quarter increased 1.2% to $475.9 million as compared to $470.4 million in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the $21.2 million of contribution from the Captiva, Neurio and Pika acquisitions and approximately $3 million negative impact from foreign currency, core sales declined approximately 3% during the quarter. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the first quarter by product class. Residential product sales during the first quarter increased 18.3% to $257.6 million as compared to $217.8 million in the prior year, with core growth being approximately 9% when excluding the contributions from clean energy products acquired through Neurio and Pika. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generators sales continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth approaching 20%. Partially offsetting the home standby strength during the first quarter was a decline in shipments of portable generators, primarily as a result of the higher power outage activity in the prior year quarter. Commercial and industrial product net sales for the first quarter of 2020 declined 17.7% to $172.1 million as compared to $209.1 million in the prior year quarter, with a core sales decline of approximately 17% when excluding the contributions from the Captiva acquisition and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency. As Aaron mentioned, shipments to both national telecom and rental account customers declined significantly compared to the prior year as these customers can significantly fluctuate their capital expenditures from quarter-to-quarter, especially during this current environment. Internationally, our C&I products declined compared to the prior year on a core basis due to the continuation of a challenging economic environment entering the first quarter, that worsened during the quarter as the spread of coronavirus pandemic accelerated. Net sales for the other products and services category, primarily made up of aftermarket service parts, product accessories, extended warranty amortizations and other service offerings, increased 6.5% to $46.2 million as compared to $43.4 million in the first quarter of 2019. A larger installed base of our products and higher levels of extended warranty revenue drove this increase versus prior year. As disclosed in our earnings release earlier this morning, gross profit margin improved 170 basis points to 36.2% compared to 34.5% in the prior year first quarter. And operating expenses increased $18.5 million or 20.3% as compared to the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA, before deducting for noncontrolling interests, as defined in our earnings release, was $86 million or 18.1% of net sales as compared to $87.1 million or 18.5% of net sales in the prior year. This slight EBITDA margin decline was primarily driven by the increased operating expense investments, partially offset by the impressive gross margin expansion during the quarter. All of this was despite the dilution from the initial ramp of our clean energy products. I'll now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 5.5% to $376 million, as compared to $356.5 million in the prior year quarter, which includes $20.5 million of contribution from recent acquisitions, resulting in approximately flat core growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter was $82.8 million or 22% of net sales as compared to $81.2 million in the prior year or 22.8% of net sales. International segment sales declined 12.3% to $99.9 million as compared to $113.9 million in the prior year quarter. Core sales declined approximately 10% versus prior year when excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and the Captiva acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter before deducting for noncontrolling interest was $3.3 million or 3.3% of net sales as compared to $5.9 million or 5.2% of net sales in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2020 on a consolidated basis. As disclosed in our earnings release, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $44.5 million as compared to $44.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. GAAP income taxes during the current year first quarter were $9.4 million or an effective tax rate of 17.9% as compared to $15 million or an effective tax rate of 24.7%. The decline in tax rate was driven by higher share-based compensation deductions and favorable geographical mix of earnings in the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.68 in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.76 in the prior year. The specific calculations for earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $55.1 million in the current year quarter or $0.87 per share versus $56.5 million in the prior year or $0.91 per share. Cash income taxes for the first quarter of 2020 were $7.3 million as compared to $10.5 million in the prior year quarter. The current year now reflects an expected cash income tax rate of approximately 14% for the full year 2020 as compared to our previous guidance of between 15.5% to 16.5%. The prior year first quarter was based on an expected cash tax rate of approximately 17% for the full year 2019. Recall that every dollar of pre-tax earnings over and beyond our $30 million tax shield is now taxed at the expected GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%. Cash flow from operations was $11.3 million as compared to $14.6 million in the prior year first quarter, and free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was a negative $0.9 million as compared to a negative $0.6 million in the same quarter last year. Recall, historical seasonality would have much lower levels of free cash flow in the first half of the year with significantly higher cash flow generated during the second half of the year. Before discussing our updated outlook for 2020, I think it's important to discuss in detail our healthy balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of the first quarter of 2020, which gives us confidence to operate our business and execute our strategy in this uncertain world. As of March 31, 2020, we had $573 million of liquidity comprised of $307 million of cash on hand, and approximately $266 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in June 2023. Also, total debt outstanding at the end of the first quarter was $894 million, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was only 2.0 times on an as-reported basis, which is at the low end of our targeted range of 2.0 to 3.0 times. Recall that in December 2019, we amended our term loan and credit agreement, which, among other things, extended the maturity of the term loan to December 26 to December 2026, and we currently do not have any required principal payments on this facility until the maturity date. Also recall that there are no financial covenants on the term loan, and it has a low cost of debt of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. In addition, we recently entered into some additional interest rate swap arrangements that hedge or fix our interest rate exposure on approximately $500 million of this debt through the maturity date of December 2026. Further enhancing our liquidity position over the last 12 months ended March 31, 2020, cash flow from operations was $305.7 million, and free cash flow was $250.4 million.  Lastly, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we have significant resources to drive further shareholder value as we execute on our long-term strategic priorities, and our approach toward capital deployment priorities remains disciplined, balanced and consistent. With that, I will now provide comments on our updated outlook for 2020. Given the current and impending impact of COVID-19 on our end customers, distribution partners, operations, supply chain, logistics and global end markets, we are revising our previous guidance that was initiated on February 13 of this year. For the full year 2020, net sales are now expected to decline between 5% to 10% compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis. Consistent with our historical approach, this revised guidance still assumes an average level of baseline power outages during the year and does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event, such as a Category III or higher landed hurricane. Given its high probability of occurring, we have included the impact of one significant shutoff event in California in this base guidance. Should there be a major power outage event during 2020, along with multiple public safety power shutoffs in California, we could expect approximately 3% to 5% of incremental revenue growth on top of the baseline guidance, resulting in flat to down 7% as reported sales growth as an upside case. Looking at the baseline guidance by product class. Despite the impacts of COVID-19, net sales for residential products are still expected to be expected to see solid year-over-year growth for the full year 2020. As previously mentioned, because power outages can happen anytime and anywhere, demand for our residential products is more resilient and tends to decouple from overall macroeconomic trends. As the vast majority of U.S. citizens are spending much more time at home, facing some form of sheltering in place orders, the awareness of backup power is increasing, especially as homeowners are doing more critical activities like working and learning from home. In addition, with California emerging as a major market for backup power and our entrance into clean energy, we believe these incremental growth drivers will help to offset the impact of lower consumer spending due to COVID-19. Net sales for our C&I products are now expected to be down significantly versus prior year. As previously discussed, for our C&I end markets around the world, we are seeing a significant negative impact as a result of the pandemic and lower oil prices. In particular, global demand for mobile products has sharply declined over the last 45 days. And based on our current visibility, we expect these conditions to persist for the remainder of 2020. Additionally, we have recently we are recently seeing global weakness for C&I stationary products as quoting and order rates for this equipment have declined, projects are getting deferred or canceled, and capital expenditures are getting curtailed. These considerable headwinds have created significant uncertainty. And as a result, we have lowered our expectations for C&I products for the remainder of 2020. The impact of COVID-19 on our business is expected to be more pronounced during the second quarter, especially for C&I products. Specifically, on a consolidated basis, net sales during the second quarter are expected to decline modestly on a sequential basis as compared to the first quarter of 2020, with C&I product shipments expected to be down sequentially and residential product shipments expected to be up sequentially compared to the first quarter of 2020. Using our baseline guidance for 2020 net sales, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for noncontrolling interests are now expected to be approximately 19% to 20%, which is only a slight reduction from our original 20% guidance that was initiated in our last earnings release. We believe holding EBITDA margins largely in line in this environment is notable, as we expect the operating deleverage on lower sales volumes to be mostly offset by favorable sales mix of residential products and the reduction in operating expenses from the cost-cutting actions that were previously mentioned. Additionally, assuming our upside case revenue guidance, adjusted EBITDA margins could incrementally increase by approximately 50 basis points over the baseline guidance. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to decline modestly on a sequential basis in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter, primarily due to reduced operating leverage on the lower expected revenue volumes, but then improved sequentially during each of the third and fourth quarters as we work to reduce the cost structure of our energy storage products, implement cost reduction actions, realize additional savings from our profitability enhancement program and improve leverage of our operating expenses through higher top line. For full year 2020, operating and free cash flow generation is still expected to be strong and follow historical seasonality, benefiting from the healthy conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow expected to be approximately 100% in 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.
Brian Drab: But can you talk a little bit about what you're expecting in the solar market in the second quarter and beyond, expecting drop-off in consultations and installations in that market, just given social distancing? And what have you seen so far in April in that market?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Brian, so on the clean energy market, as we define it, it's really solar plus storage. And what we did is, we put our guidance range at 125 to 150 megawatts for the full year, which is down somewhat slightly from the more bullish number we gave on the last call. And that really a lot of that pullback is going to happen here in the second quarter. Solar installations are down notably, some 25%, 30%, depending on which firm you talk to and which part of the country you look at. But the good news is solar storage attachment rates are up. So, that's kind of offsetting some of that. So I think net-net, we're saying that the new guide for storage for the year is 125 to 150 megawatt hours, but the second quarter is probably going to be a little bit lower than we were hoping.
Brian Drab: Okay. And how has your supply I know you're saying one of the limitations here, the big limitation in that clean energy business was your supply chain. And how is that shaping up in this environment? And is that still restraining you?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Actually, oddly enough. I mean, we've the team has been working very hard on supply chain and this to broaden our base. Generally, the companies we acquired were smaller, start-up businesses with fairly localized supply chains initially and certainly not supply chains that could build the scale. So, we had to completely reinvent that for the most part. And the teams did a great job on that. And I think that was a watch out early on for us. But right now, we feel like we're in a pretty good position. And frankly, I think with the overall pullback in the market, our numbers, I think, would mirror much of what others are saying about the clean energy space in general. I think there's probably going to be a little bit more supply to be added than maybe was originally anticipated simply because of the lower volumes that are going to be out there.
Brian Drab: Okay, great. And then maybe I'll just ask one more for now. But did you say anything about what you have seen in April in terms of in-home consultations for the legacy home standby product? And maybe could you comment about what you're seeing in terms of IHCs inside California and outside California?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean, IHCs have been really strong for us so far in April. We track we track a lot of metrics for that business, obviously, leading indicators, lagging indicators. But the one that we track very closely, obviously, as a leading indicator is IHCs, VHCs, we now call them VHCs because they're virtual. They're double so far in April here versus last year, which is great. And for this time of year, in particular, generally, we would be kind of entering a bit of a lull period here in terms of new sales leads, coming kind of the transition from winter to spring is something that generally slows the sales cycle down a bit. Seasonally, we've just seen this. It repeats pretty reliably. We've definitely decoupled from that. Now we had a lot of power outages down south last week, about 1.4 million people in the south last week and about 300,000 people actually yesterday in Texas and Louisiana. But what's interesting is so certainly, some of that strength is coming from that. And we look specifically at those regions. But specifically, when we look at VHCs kind of regionally, they're strong everywhere. And in fact, what's really odd to us, you look at California alone, California and you look at IHCs, it's they're in April here, they're crazy high. I mean, they're 10 times what they were last year. And there haven't been any outages yet in California.  So our thesis underpinning this is that, there's just been a dramatic increase in the awareness around the importance of backup power with everybody sheltering in place. The idea of working from home and learning from home and all these other things that the home is a sanctuary, I think a continuous supply of power, safety, security, the ability to go on with life, takes on a completely new meaning, when you're cooped up inside your home 24/7. And I think people in the uncertainty around how long the pandemic may last, and whether it may reoccur in the fall or may persist or rather future pandemics, whatever the case may be, I think it just adds one more layer of consideration for people when it comes to thinking about needing backup power. And I think that's also contributing to some of the increased attachment rates that we're seeing in the solar plus storage. I think we know from customers that resiliency is important to them.  Now we also know and we told customers, they don't get a tremendous amount of resiliency out of those products, but they do get some. And I think it's important though to note that those things all kind of point to the fact that I think the pandemic itself is raising the awareness and just heightening the level of anxiety around making sure people have backup power.
Operator: And your next question line of Mike Halloran with Baird.
Mike Halloran: So just staying on the home standby side here. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you see this cadencing out here? Obviously, strong consultations, as we sit here today. How does that compare to installs? Is it just building a backlog for you to execute on? Are you able to execute on as it sits today? And then when you think about the guidance range as well, is the expectation for growth in the home standby product category year-over-year, is that what's embedded in guidance as well?
York Ragen : Yes. I mean I think what we said in the prepared comments is that residential products overall would be up solid, I think, was the word I used in the prepared comments, but underpinning that would be growth slight growth in home standby, which I think is which is a win in this environment.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And Mike, I think just to answer the first part of your question there about IHCs or VHCs and how they kind of mature into installations and are we able to keep up and backlog and things like that. I think thankfully, we've got it's amazing to me. The residential part of our business, which I would have said 6, seven years ago, our visibility in that part of the business was much more limited. It's definitely easily, probably are most visible.  Part of the business today in terms of just the metrics that we track all the time fences between when an IHC occurs to when that turns into an order, to when that order turns into an installation, to when that installation turns into a first use of the product. I mean we've got all of those interesting time fences. So we're able to kind of take and model a lot of what we see for those leading indicators like VHCs. We're able to model those into installations down the line and look at kind of what we're going to need in terms of installation bandwidth, production bandwidth, things like that. And so obviously, our first priority here right now is making sure we keep our residential home standby production lines as operational as fully operational as we can. We're looking to hire 150 people right now between our Whitewater and Jefferson facilities. Some of that is to cover for some of the increased absenteeism we're seeing, but some of it is just flat out growth in the production rates as we go forward here. We're entering the important time of kind of preseason build for that market. Now we're sitting on a pretty decent amount of inventory in our four walls, but our field inventory levels, I would say are I don't know, you're clearly looking at this the other day, but field inventory are...
York Ragen: These are lower than last year.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Days of inventory days on hand are lower than they were a year ago. So, obviously when we kind of put all that together, and again, that's just another really cool statistic that we're able to pull out because we every 100% of all products get activated. So, we know 100% clarity to field inventory, which is, I think, unique. So, we put all that together. And again, our priority is on that. Now what could go wrong with that? I mean obviously, a supply chain disruption, some potential reoccurrence or re-emergence of the pandemic or an acceleration of it. Those are all things that could be a problem. On the installation side itself, we've been very encouraged that, although, we've heard kind of spotty cases of inspectors not being able to make inspections and things, because they're not working right now, they've been furloughed or but largely, our activation rates, when we look at it, which is installations, they've remained very robust. So, we know the installations are happening. We know where they're happening. And where they're not happening, we're helping out. We're trying to help out with inspectors and walk them through those things. It's interesting how many municipalities. We think that probably half of all the municipalities today have shifted to a virtual permitting process. Now the inspection process itself isn't quite there yet, but they're issuing the permits virtually, the construction permits that are needed and the building permits in any of these projects. So we're watching a lot of data points, but we feel pretty good on that. And York?
York Ragen: And I will add the number that I gave in terms of that home standby growth year-over-year was our baseline guidance. That doesn't include a major event, should that happen.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good point.
Mike Halloran: And then you certainly spent a lot of time talking about mobile, telecoms, some other things. Maybe a little comment and context on how the traditional commercial businesses are tracking? Obviously, got some puts and takes there, some decent secular drivers as well as the more institutional side, where there's still going to be decent demand versus some nonres concerns. Maybe just put all those pieces together and talk about what you're seeing on that side?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So, on our -- I'll call it our traditional C&I channel, which is our industrial distributor channel here in North America, I'll speak to that first. Actually, for the quarter, they were slightly up. So, we think we're doing all right there, outside of the telecom, kind of lumpiness that we talked about. And actually, we knew the first half of this year, the telecom companies had told us based on their scheduling and the way their CapEx budgets were rolling through this year, that, that was going to be more of a back half type of update for them. That's the part of the guidance really that took the biggest hit was telecom in the second half. And then the mobile products, of course, which we've talked in length about, with the collapse in oil prices, in particular, driving that. But the core C&I business, those products are generally late cycle, right? So, you build a building, a new hospital wing, a grocery store or whatever, the product the generator itself doesn't need to arrive at the site until the facility is just about ready to open. So what we see going on right now, as we see a lot of projects coming to closure and the generators being put into those projects. What we're worried about going forward is where does nonres construction activity go. So you look at AIA Billings Indexes and you look at other leading indicators there, and they would indicate some weakness, at least certainly in Q2 here. But perhaps longer term, if this is more of a U-type recovery or maybe even an L-type recovery depending on your viewpoints, if it doesn't do if it doesn't come back like in a V shape through the second half, and we've and that's kind of what we've assumed. We have assumed that it doesn't come back in the second half for that traditional C&I business.  So if we get a better or a quicker recovery there, maybe it will. But largely, we feel like we're still winning in that market. We just think that, that market, knowing what we know about trends and watching our quotation, our inbound quotation trend has been very choppy the last kind of six weeks or so. We've had some up weeks, we've had some down weeks. And so we're watching it. But my sense is, knowing that we're late cycle and knowing that we're entering kind of a period of economic uncertainty. I think we're going to see fewer projects going forward, which likely is going to put pressure on that channel, and that's really what we've modeled here in the guidance today.
Operator: Your next question from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Just wanted to verity on the comment, VHC is up to a double year-over-year. Is that combining the VHC/IHC concepts or like total consultations, is what that refers to?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Correct. So think of them as all VHCs going forward, Chris. That's how we'll start to refer to them.
Christopher Glynn: And I think you addressed the deployment characteristics. Sounds like dealers are proving very resilient so far. I'm wondering, if there's any market for ESS attachments, independent of solar or if it's exclusively tied to solar?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. There are some. It really depends on the market specifics in terms of the price of power in a particular market, incentives that may be available in that market. Some utilities have policies prohibiting some of those types of approaches. So it's kind of utility-to-utility as well. So I would say though largely, the market is a solar plus storage market at this point. As power rates continue to increase, so the spark spread, the cost at which you can buy power on the wholesale market versus the cost at which you can produce it on-site or store it on-site for, as that continues to widen, a storage-only type of approach or an approach where you're producing power through some other means, a gas generator, maybe geothermal, something like this and then storing that power in a system and then using it at a later time. That could become more prevalent in the future.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And last one here. The $25 million to $30 million cost out, should we think of that as predominantly flowing through your C&I businesses?
Aaron Jagdfeld: It will be more disproportionately impacting the C&I businesses. Although, I will say some of the advertising that we've taken out the advertising and promotion we've taken out in our residential businesses to match kind of the slight reduction in guide there. There's a part of that, the dollars add up quick on that side of business because it's such a big business. But largely, the $25 million to $30 million, you can think of as cost-outs associated with mobile, stationary C&I and our international businesses.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Can you folks talk about what proportion of your dealer network is it has accepted and is doing VHCs there? And in terms of the productivity that you folks are getting at, can you talk about the improvement as a result of VHCs instead of IHCs? What have the early numbers been like in terms of how many more proposals or single distributors able to do as a result of the efficiency gains there?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Jerry, the VHC process, it's interesting. We actually have been developing this over the last couple of years. And we've been reticent to turn it on because there's a fundamental belief that a sales transaction, the act of selling is a transferal of a motion, and that transference of a motion generally tends to take place more readily in person. And so that's been the foundational element of our in-home sales process, which is largely a kind of kitchen table sales pitch. So, we've had this VHC process in development. We obviously accelerated it, as anxiety levels for anybody coming in your home today are much higher than they were two months ago. We accelerated that, rolled it out to the dealers over the last 45 days. The dealers it's been a learning curve, and but what they found, interestingly enough to kind of get to the heart of your question. They found that they're able to be more productive overall because they don't have the travel element. Or they don't have as great of a travel element and the time commitment to do the VHC is substantially lower. They're able to do these proposals and send them off electronically. They're able to conduct with a couple of pictures, a couple of questions from the homeowner, maybe a walk around the site, depending on kind of complexities of a particular site, maybe job to job. But largely, the feedback from dealers is they've been more productive. Now it's pretty new. So the last 45 days, I don't think it would be worthwhile to give you like hard stats on, like the numbers in terms of productivity, and it continues to ramp. But the percentage of dealers that are doing it is very high. And again, that's largely because homeowners are they're just not keen on people being in their homes right now. So, we've encouraged them to shift to this process and they've accepted it quite well. Homeowners have accepted it quite well. And everybody at this point is very pleased with the transition.
Jerry Revich: And just to clarify, even with everything's going on in relatively limited rollout of VHCs, you folks the combination of IHC plus VHCs have doubled year-over-year in April, with everything that's going on?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Exactly. Yes, that's the part that again, I can't stress enough how amazing or resilient the home standby business is for us. It's a shockingly durable business and I've seen this before. We saw this in the '08 housing crisis. The home that residential products business for us grew during the housing crisis. Now it's got low penetration rates and it's got obviously, power outages continue to grow and people's dependence on power grows. And you add this additional layers that we've talked about of sheltering-in-place as an additional level of anxiety around losing your power. And it's just a...
York Ragen: Dependency on technology...
Aaron Jagdfeld: Dependency on technology and communication and connectivity of the world. I mean it's amazing. If you lose power and you're in your home today, I mean, it's a different experience and maybe it even was 30 days ago or 60 days ago.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And in terms of the battery storage part of the business, just order of magnitude, can you just correct me if I'm wrong, so you folks installed about 20 or so megawatts in first quarter? And it sounds like you expect to do something like 10 in the second and exit the year, 60 megawatts? Is that the right way to think about the ramp? Can you just put a finer point on that for us, if you don't mind?
York Ragen: Yes. I mean, we didn't give necessarily seasonal guidance on the 125 to 150 megawatt hours deployed. But I think with Q2 that we had originally expected that to grow pretty evenly throughout the year. When we originally guided, I think with the impact of the pandemic, I think the Q2 rates will have slow, maybe not as significantly as you just raveled off there, but then it should grow nicely off of Q2 into Q3 and then sequentially into Q4. So didn't necessarily provide that level of detail in terms of quarter-to-quarter seasonality.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond: Just on, I guess on solar, just want to understand a little bit better like, channel sale versus sell-through? And maybe just talk about as you kind of ramp this business up, any more progress on solar dealer distribution partners and feedback from your traditional channel?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So I mean, we've got, we kind of alluded to it on the call. We've got pretty good visibility there already. A lot of preordering in that business early on here in the first quarter. So we have a decent backlog that we're working from. We're shifting our attention to continuing to add customers, which I think is the other part of your question, Jeff, in terms of acceptance of the product, it is interesting. Our initial thesis there was that we take these 6,500 residential dealers, we'd introduce these new products, and they would grab that and they'd run forward with it and promote it. The truth of the matter is, some of them have, some of them that are a little bit more out in the vanguard, some of them were already involved with solar. So that's a much easier connection point. But largely, that's going to take more time.  I think it's the takeaway there for us. But where we are getting success and we're having where we're seeing some really good acceptance is in the solar installed channel themselves, both the national installers, the national companies as well as the independent channel and the distribution partners that they use. So the wholesale channels that feed the equipment into those independent dealers, we've had a lot of really good success early on here, introducing the product to them. Obviously, we're out there talking to them how we're driving leads in this space, we're driving awareness around solar plus storage, the importance and driving those attachment rates. And that gives we get some really high marks from these guys because, that perennial challenge in the solar market has been customer acquisition costs. And obviously, anybody coming into the space, writing large checks, and we're writing large checks right now to drive not only our own brand awareness in space, but also market awareness overall and penetration rates. Anybody doing that, to help them with their customer act costs and keep those lower is that goes a long way. So we're getting a lot of great pickup there. The interesting thing, the part of our thesis that we didn't have, right, aside from the dealers, not maybe picking it up as quickly, but these solar dealers are very interested in home standby. We've had many of them are adding home standby. So we're picking up new points of life there that we really hadn't attributed much business to kind of in how we had modeled our entrance into clean energy. So it's explaining out maybe a little differently than we had thought. But I would say that, on a net-net basis, it's playing out more favorably, as obviously, as our numbers would indicate, more favorably than what we had laid out back in the Investor Day, back in September.
Jeff Hammond: And then California, certainly, the number is pretty eye-popping on like the growth rate in 1Q and IHC growth rates. Can you just I'm just trying to maybe frame size of California in 2019, kind of how you're thinking about the longer-term goal? And what those growth rates look like into the second half, when you kind of hit the, I guess, the little bit tougher comps?
York Ragen: Yes. I mean, we haven't specifically broke out our sales into California across the company. I know we talked over the last maybe couple of quarters. 2018, it was a very small number. We added roughly a little over $75 million last year to California. And we expect to add a sizable amount to California into 2020, sounds maybe something similar. And that will continue we expect that to continue to grow into 2021 and 2022, especially as we build out distribution. We quoted, we have over 400 dealers now in California. We're going to continue to add dealers. And so it's a nice growth opportunity for us. And the numbers I'm quoting are just power generation. That does not include any clean energy. I just want to be clear.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America.
Ross Gilardi: Aaron, I'd love to just get your read on the California regulatory environment right now, always a joy to analyze that. But what do you think? I mean, is PG&E really going to shut the power off on California in the fall, as COVID comes back and people are stuck working from home. It would be major economic implications for California, if they do that, potentially outside of California. So like, what kind of discussions are happening? I mean, are there potentially any subsidies for the consumers to install generators? Is there any opportunity to form some type of distribution agreement with the public utilities or partnership in preparation for wildfire season? Because this just seems doubly dangerous going into the second half of the year, not only the human aspect of it, as was the case last year, but just economically, it would be devastating, if they continue to kind of carry forward with the same tactics?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's a fascinating situation out there, Ross. In terms of the regulatory environment, I won't comment on the beaches being closed out there, but I think that was announced this morning. But as it relates to power, so there's two school of thought, right? I mean you have, okay all these people sheltering-in-place and so you can't possibly shut the power off on them because of that. But actually, every conversation we've had is, no. It's just the opposite. You have all these people sheltering-in-place, therefore, they're in their homes. So, you have to prevent wildfires. I mean the catastrophic effects in terms of the human toll on that should there be a fire, with everybody in their homes, could be much greater than the economic effect. And it's arguable, there's already going to be an economic effect from COVID-19. So, I don't think any of us can avoid that at this point. So, I think that what the schools of thought there are, and in particular, PG&E would tell you, and we've heard them say this, that they believe the power shutoffs last year were largely responsible for the reduction in wildfires. They've equated a high correlation to that. So, and in terms of their operating process going forward, they feel that they're going to use that absolutely as a tool whereas in the past, they haven't, right? So and again, there's a lot of things that go into that decision. Now as far as other partnerships and things, we were actually I commend PG&E. They were trying to do the right thing. In terms of grid support projects, we were actually bidding in our C&I business on some large grid support projects out there with natural gas gens and other products. But regulators have made it almost impossible for them to make the kinds of changes that they need to make. There was reticence to add those types of products because they're fossil fuel based. But yet at the same time, the additional technologies that could be used are not ready for prime time. The cost effectiveness in those technologies, the overall effectiveness of those technologies are not there yet. And so their hands are tied. And so they killed some of those projects, those grid support projects. And I think that always that's only going to put more pressure on the grid and on PG&E to use power shutoffs as a tool as we go into the fall. So I again, a lot of it's going to depend on the fire season. They're having an early drought. I think the weather service identified it as a mega drought in parts of the country here that California is in. Now they've had a little bit of rain lately, but overall, it's been very dry and it's been very warm. So we see it in the trends, Ross. There are people are obviously worried about it. Our VHCs are way up, our activations are way up, our dealer counts are way up. People are concerned about power outages in California.
Ross Gilardi: And then any color you can provide on the margin sensitivity to the clean energy ramp in terms of fixed versus variable? Or originally, I think you had baked in EBITDA breakeven by the end of the year. Are you taking your guide down as pad, but like any clarity on the revenue breakeven point? Or just at what point does it become a bigger drag from margins, if it doesn't ramp as quickly as you expect in the second half of the year?
York Ragen: Yes, it's good. I think previously, we talked yes, we expect to break even with those products for the year. We still expect to breakeven even, even with the slight pullback that we had, we just moderated some of the OpEx around that. But I think internally, we're still expecting to break even for those products for the year with start-up losses in the first half, profitability in the second half. I think for the year overall, roughly maybe about a 1.5% drag on overall corporate margins as a result of that business. But obviously, the exit EBITDA margins, leaving the year should look good and they should continue to improve into 2021 then.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line to Phil Shen with Roth Capital Partners.
Phil Shen: First one is first one is on the visibility that you have. You talked about, Aaron, having great visibility into your key leading indicators and stats. Can you share how the timing between the closing of a sale and activation/installation has changed? What was the pre-COVID and what do you think it could be now? You talked about also maybe 50% of the building departments out there doing virtual permits. Will that suggesting half are actually not doing those virtual permits and resulting in delays. So, I can imagine there's been an extension of that installation time. Just want to get a feel for the degree? And then how long do you guys expect this to take to normalize?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. No, it's a great question, Phil. And I'm actually looking at a chart that we pulled together on that very point because it's, again, it's another kind of data point we watch very closely. Because if you pull out the number of days or if you extend the number of days, that can certainly result in creating a potential air pocket at some point in the future for purchases as you work backwards from the install to when the dealer needs to buy the equipment. But so there's a lot of different time fences involved here. But I think what I'll largely say rather than we haven't given a ton of granularity around this historically, but I will say this, it has gotten longer, kind of pre-COVID, the levels were kind of thinking that 60- to 70-day range between VHC and the activation. So, the quote and the install, right, if you want to use more kind of different nomenclature there. But and so what that that peaked at around 90 days? So, kind of at the height of, kind of as we got through the month of March, so it went up considerably. That's a 40% or 50% increase in the amount of time. But more recently, in the last few weeks, we've seen it come down back into almost normal levels, which is interesting. So, now the comment about 50% of inspectors doing virtual permitting. Remember, there are a lot of places around the country where the permitting is still going on. So, you can still walk up to your local township and get a permit. Or were they just they haven't shut down as hard as maybe areas of like the Northeast or parts of the country where, clearly, that's been more challenging. In the Midwest, largely here, you can still go get a permit. You can't get a haircut, but you can get a permit for building project. But it is interesting, and it is something we watch very closely, and we'll continue to watch that very closely.
Phil Shen: Great. And so just as a follow-up to that. And I know you haven't provided specific guidance, but York, in any way that you guys can qualitatively talk about the cadence between Q2 home standby sales versus Q3 from the modeling standpoint, I think that could be very helpful? Because if your I can imagine Q3 should be up relative to Q2. If you're double year-over-year in terms of VHCs and your close ratios are basically the same, which is what I think you said? And if this...
York Ragen: Yes, I think, again, a base case guidance doesn't assume a major power outage. I think for the year, I said home standbys would be up slightly, at least that's what we modeled. That's what's embedded into our residential guidance. And the second half would look like that in terms of that guidance. So, that's how that's again, that was I mean, there's a lot of uncertainty with COVID-19. We don't know exactly the impact on consumer spending. So...
Aaron Jagdfeld: But the category in general has a fair amount of seasonality to it. So, it's definitely...
York Ragen: Yes, somewhere year-over-year growth, yes.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, yes. But definitely, in terms of pacing, though, you're kind of going through...
York Ragen: But when you connect the I see that have doubled, overall it's showing up slightly. There's a bit of a disconnect there partly. Maybe we're taking a conservative view on the impact on consumer spending related with COVID-19. But we also know that tends to be coupled from economic environments when power outages actually happen. So...
Aaron Jagdfeld: I would just add one last comment there. Typically, VHCs, we would see an increase as we go into the season. So, that increase is obviously happening earlier than normal. So, the extent of the -- you have to kind of put it in perspective, the in-season, out-of-season. So there is some of that, that you have to do as well. But yes, we get the question, and it's we think we're modeling it appropriately. We got a lot of experience doing this. And it's hard to say what the consumer impact is going to be in the back half. So we're kind of trying to model some of that as well. There's a little bit of the air that's going to come out of the balloon certainly around res investment, but that's a good question, Phil.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Joseph Osha with JMP Group.
Joseph Osha: Well, for starters, as a resident of California, I can tell you that the state will reliably choose the most economically disastrous path. So just wanted to clarify that. two questions for you. First, I'm wondering whether some of this incremental supply chain looseness you've talked about has turned up in your cell supply situation? Are you finding that you're able to get enough lithium-ion supply for your storage business?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Joe, that hasn't been a challenge at this point. Now we are actively looking to expand our supply base on all of our major components, again, kind of coming from a position of two start-up companies that largely had a pretty nascent supply chain, the Pika organization was buying through distribution, as an example, for that lithium product. And so we've gone direct to the manufacturer, obviously, is a way to not only shorten the supply chain, but making more cost effective. But a lot it really depends in lithium, and as you well know, a lot of it really depends on EV demand. So where does EV demand go here? And I think largely, 2020 could be a more challenging space for EV demand in parts of the world, and particularly like China than what was originally forecasted. So that should certainly loosen up supply for cells. But that being said, we are still looking at continuing to expand our base of supply for those.
Joseph Osha: And then secondly, this is kind of an odd question. I'm wondering if and as you point out, your storage gives you sort of near-term resilience. But and that's not going to get you through 72 hours of PG&E shutting down. But there are some other cases to be made for storage in terms of time shifting, and time of using and so forth. Have you seen anyone look at a solar plus storage plus backup power configuration? Is that happening?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. That is a that's a request that we hear repeatedly from our customers at this point. And we believe we're in a great position to be able to solve that. And that's something that as we go forward, there's a really good case to be made for the durability of a system like that. And in fact, with natural gas prices where they're at, in terms of just as low as they are, the ability to produce your own power on-site for the purposes of either charging your storage system or perhaps, using some of that power to extend the resilience, again, either as a battery charging system and/or as a substitute for the battery itself, if the battery gets fully depleted. Now we believe there are some use cases there. And I think that's a product that you will see in the marketplace here, in short order.
Operator: And I will now turn the call back over to Mike Harris for closing remarks.
Mike Harris : We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our second quarter earnings results with you in late July. Thank you again, and good bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-13 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Generac Holdings Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] We are joined today by Aaron Jagdfeld, Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mike Harris, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Harris: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including a reconciliation to comparable US GAAP measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Mike, and welcome back. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to 2019 and capped a tremendous year for Generac. We achieved a record quarterly revenue - a record for revenue and all-time records for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Revenue during the quarter exceeded our expectations headlined by strong home standby demand from robust growth in California, driven by the growing threat an occurrence of public safety power shut-offs, along with the overall continuation of a favorable outage environment. The revenue outperformance during the quarter was also due to strength in shipments of domestic commercial and industrial stationary generators sold through our North American distributor channel, along with higher than expected sales of domestic mobile products. These areas of strength were partially offset by lower than expected results from the continued slowdown in international markets. On a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 5% during the fourth quarter as compared to the very strong prior-year comparison where overall revenue growth was 14% and core sales growth was approximately 12%. Core sales growth for the - current year fourth quarter, which excludes both the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency was approximately 4%. Gross margin expanded 130 basis points compared to prior-year and was better than our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained strong at 22% and also came in better than forecasted. We monetized the significant amount of working capital during the quarter and generated robust free cash flow of $160 million. Before discussing fourth quarter results in more detail, I want to provide some full year financial highlights, as well as share some key accomplishments that we achieved during the year. 2019 was another record year for Generac across the board for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Revenue grew 9% for the full year, which was on top of very strong top line growth in both 2018 and 2017 of 21% and 16%, respectively. Gross margin expanded 40 basis points for the year to 36.2% and adjusted EBITDA margin came in strong at 20.6%. Led by our fourth quarter performance, we generated over $250 million of free cash flow for the full year. We believe, 2019 provides further support that the secular penetration opportunity for home standby generators is as compelling as it has ever been, with shipments increasing at a strong rate during the year and very encouraging trends with several key performance metrics that we monitor closely. We made significant progress in ramping up efforts to capitalize on a dramatic increase in generator interest and demand in California due to the power shut-off events by local utilities as residential product shipments alone to the state increased by more than $50 million compared to the prior year. We also launched our new clean energy efforts during the year by entering into the energy storage and monitoring markets, including making the important strategic acquisitions of Pika and Neurio during the first half of 2019. We achieved an exciting milestone during the fourth quarter by shipping the first of our new PWRcell storage systems with our PWRview monitoring platform, which has been very well received by the market to date. Another key accomplishment during 2019 was the exceptionally strong growth experienced for domestic C&I stationary generators, which benefited from market share gains and the dual secular drivers of increasing penetration for natural gas generators and the impending deployment of next-generation 5G wireless technology. We also further expanded our International business with the Captiva acquisition in India during the first quarter, one of the largest power generation markets in the world. We generated record earnings and cash flow in 2019, while at the same time significantly increasing our operating and capital investments across the business to align with our long-term core growth targets and to capitalize on the numerous growth opportunities that lie ahead for Generac. Accordingly, we plan for a notable increase in operating expenses in order to invest in a variety of initiatives across the business. And we had a nearly 30% increase in capital expenditures for the year compared to 2018, with the majority relating to growth investments within our operations in our facilities. Discussing these accomplishments further across the business for 2019, shipments for home standby generators during the fourth quarter once again increased at a very strong rate compared to the prior year due to greater outage activity in the US and Canada, including the power shut-off events in California. In fact, power outage severity grew at a solid rate during the fourth quarter compared to last year and was considerably higher relative to the long-term baseline average. Activations were also up significantly during the fourth quarter when compared to the prior year with the regional strength being broad-based in nature with the exception of the Northeast. Growth in the West region was particularly strong, driven by California, which was approximately six times higher than the prior-year quarter. Also, in-home consultations or IHCz grew at a significant rate during the quarter compared to the prior year. For full year 2019, our leadership in the home standby product category continued as our market share further improved and ended the year at nearly 80%. Power outage severity for the full year 2019 was notably higher than the long-term baseline average, further reinforcing one of the key macro themes for our business related to increasing power quality issues from an aging and an under-invested electrical grid, which has lifted more vulnerable to the increasing unpredictability - unpredictable and more severe weather patterns that are being driven by climate change. We are particularly excited that in 2019, we generated the most IHCs ever with the IHC close rate reaching its highest level and representing a more than 50% increase from 2014 levels, which was the first full year of our proprietary PowerPlay in-home selling system. Also, the cost per IHC, which would represent our customer acquisition cost continues to come down and finish 2019 at its lowest level since the inception of PowerPlay. Additionally, we experienced an all-time high for home standby activations for the full year with the Midwest and West regions particularly strong and with the dramatic increase in California of nearly four times higher than 2018. We ended the year with approximately 6,500 residential dealers, a meaningful increase of roughly 500 dealers from the end of 2018, with dealer counts in California, significantly expanding from around 100 at the beginning of the year to over 350 at the end of the year. Generac created the home standby category over two decades ago, and we estimate the market today is well in excess of $1 billion annually, with every 1% of penetration representing approximately $2 billion of additional market opportunity at retail prices. With penetration rates of single-family unattached homes in the US still below 5%, there remains considerable room for this dynamic market to continue to grow. One area in particular with some of the greatest potential to increase penetration is California. During the fourth quarter, the market for emergency backup power in the state quickly accelerated with local utilities triggering numerous and significant power shut-off events impacting millions of customers in an attempt to mitigate the risk of wildfires. Some of these shut-offs were multi-day events and are projected to continue for the years ahead, as the impact of climate change and the massive under-investment in Northern California's power grid have combined to create a situation where public safety needs are being prioritized overpower quality. This has resulted in significant awareness and increased demand for our generators in California, where penetration rates of home standby generators stand at approximately only 1%. We are intensely focused on expanding distribution in California, and we are working together with local regulators, inspectors and gas utilities to increase their bandwidth and sense of urgency around improving and providing the infrastructure necessary for home standby, another backup power products. We are anticipating significant revenue growth in California during 2020, and continue to believe the total generator opportunity for Generac in the state could potentially be as high as $200 million annually in the years ahead. Our efforts in this part of the country will also prove to be helpful in developing the energy storage and monitoring markets where the installed base of solar and other renewable sources are some of the highest in the US, but the corresponding penetration rates of complementary energy storage systems are very low. With regard to clean energy specifically, the market for residential energy storage and monitoring systems within the US continues to develop rapidly. Through a combination of changing regulations, advancements in technology and improving economics, the legacy utility model will undergo a massive amount of change in the decade ahead. We believe the need for distributed power generation coupled with sophisticated energy monitoring and energy management capabilities will allow homeowners and business owners more flexibility in where their power comes from, how much it costs and how they consume it. The new capabilities associated with the Pika and Neurio acquisitions have enabled us to bring an efficient and intelligent energy-saving solution to the market, which we believe will position Generac as a key participant going forward. We achieved a significant milestone during the fourth quarter with the first shipments of the new PWRcell energy storage system that began in mid-December. We are making excellent progress in ramping up our clean energy efforts, including building out our dealer base, reducing system cost through our global supply chain and deploying targeted marketing alongside our in-home selling capabilities. Although early, our new clean energy infomercial that launched in mid-January has performed well and we are generating sales leads through our proprietary in-home selling system that we call PowerPlay CE, the industry's first complete solar plus storage cells and lead management tool for installers and dealers. With demand for our clean energy products dramatically outpacing our initial expectations, we're working hard to secure additional capacity for key subsystems and components, allowing us to further ramp our supply chain. Our current outlook for clean energy in 2020 has far exceeded our original business case from earlier last year when we first completed the acquisitions of Neurio and Pika. Our latest view is that we now expect to deploy over 150 megawatt-hours of storage during 2020, which is a significant increase from our prior expectations of 100-plus megawatt-hours. Although very different from the extended emergency backup power space we serve today, we believe the energy storage market will develop similarly as the home standby generator market has over the past two decades. Our efforts to develop omni-channel distribution, targeted consumer-based marketing content and proprietary in-home sales tools have played a critical role in creating the market for home standby generators. And we intend to leverage our expertise and capabilities in these areas, as we work to grow the energy storage and monitoring markets and lower overall customer acquisition costs. We believe we have a unique opportunity to develop Generac into a company and a brand that is associated with the complete energy ecosystem of a home or a business, from power generation to storage to energy monitoring to energy management, thereby positioning us to be perhaps the only company that can offer products and solutions, allowing end-users to take full control of their energy needs. We are incredibly optimistic that our efforts around clean energy could create potential new business models for the Company in the future. And we are confident that it will become a meaningful part of our business in the years ahead. In addition to our efforts with clean energy and the expansion of our residential side of our business, our domestic C&I stationary generators also grew again during the quarter, with broad-based shipments through our North American distributor channel. This strength was partially offset by lower shipments of C&I products to national telecom and rental account customers. As we have previously discussed, demand trends with telecom can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of our customers' capital spending needs. Also, domestic shipments of mobile equipment remain soft in the quarter as major rental customers continue to differ capital spending. For the full year 2019, we experienced exceptionally strong growth for domestic C&I stationary generators, benefiting from the secular drivers of increasing penetration of natural gas generators and in the impending deployment of next-generation 5G technology, along with higher specification rates, improvements in how we go to market and market share gains. Over the years, we have worked hard to promote the cleaner and more cost-effective use of natural gas power generation as an alternative for the traditional diesel-powered systems used in emergency backup applications. We believe the natural gas has many superior characteristics with its abundant supply, low price, logistical advantages and environmental benefits which have driven growth rates over the past several years for gas backup generators at twice the level of diesel generators. Importantly, the opportunity for natural gas generators outside the US remains nascent and a core part of our strategy is to capitalize on the opportunity with our growing global footprint, additional focused investment and leverage our unique expertise within this area. We also believe the long-term opportunity with selling backup power solutions to telecom national account customers is very compelling, as wireless carriers further build out and harden their existing networks to prepare for the impending deployment of the new 5G technology. The need for a continuous supply of power to wireless sites will become even more crucial as faster speeds and increased bandwidth will enable a number of impactful mission-critical technologies in the future. By taking advantage of our international footprint and scale, we believe we can become a global leader in the market for telecom backup power, similar to the leading position we have built in the Americas, as this key vertical begins another extended investment cycle in the years ahead. Although shipments for domestic mobile products experienced a cyclical decline during 2019, in our view, the longer-term need for higher levels of spending on infrastructure projects in the US is an important theme that remains intact. And we believe this will translate into greater demand for mobile products in the years ahead. With respect to the international side of our business, we continue to experience a challenging environment during the fourth quarter, with the economic slowdown in the Latin American region causing delays in many large projects and an overall soft demand environment during the second half of 2019 in certain key region of the world due to trade conflicts and geopolitical headwinds. However, the order rate within our International business has been improving in recent months with an improving book-to-bill, which we anticipate will lead to a resumption in growth beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and further acceleration during the second half of the year. Over the past several years, we have significantly expanded our served market internationally, primarily through acquisitions. We believe that the longer-term, this increased global presence will be important as interest in-home standby and gas generators for commercial and industrial applications continues to gain traction in many markets around the world. In addition, we believe our international footprint will provide an important avenue for growth as we enter the clean energy space on a global basis. We believe these will be important drivers towards our long-term goal of reaching double-digit adjusted EBITDA margins for our International business in the coming years. In closing, earlier this week, we rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, commemorating the 10th anniversary of our initial public offering in February of 2010. Since going public, Generac has transformed itself from a company primarily focused on emergency backup power to an industrial technology company and now with a more specific focus on energy technology solutions. During our time as a public company, the Company has grown revenue at a compounded annual rate of 10% organically and 14% on an as-reported basis, while making significant investments across the business to dramatically expand our served addressable markets, maintaining strong adjusted EBITDA margins in the low 20% range and generating approximately $2 billion of free cash flow during the last decade. We are extremely proud of this proven track record of strong and profitable revenue growth, which has led to a total shareholder return over the past 10 years that has significantly outperformed the overall market. As we enter 2020, we're as excited as we've ever been about the future growth prospects for the Company, which are driven by the overall megatrends and powerful macular secular drivers for our business. And we will continue to aggressively invest in the strategic initiatives are aligned with the company is powering our future strategy. I now want to turn the call over to York to provide further details on the fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. York?
York Ragen: Thanks Aaron. Looking at our fourth quarter of 2019 results in more detail, net sales for the quarter increased by 4.9% to $590.9 million as compared to $563.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding the $9.1 million of contribution from the Captiva, Neurio and Pika acquisitions, and the almost $3 million negative impact from foreign currency, the core growth rate during the quarter was approximately 4%. Net sales for the full year 2019, increased 8.9% to $2.20 billion, an all-time record for the Company. Looking at our consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter by product class, residential product sales during the fourth quarter increased 9.7% to $322.5 million as compared to $293.9 million in the prior year with core growth being approximately 7% when excluding the contributions from clean energy products acquired through Neurio and Pika. As Aaron mentioned, home standby generator sales continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth primarily due to increased baseline power outage activity in the US and Canada, including the utility power shut-off event that took place in California during the quarter. As we continue our focus to drive the overall penetration of the homestand by product category, we have ramped up our efforts, particularly within California to increase awareness and distribution for these products within the state. Partially offsetting the home standby strength during the fourth quarter was a decline in shipments of portable generators compared to prior-year as a result of higher retail inventories entering the fourth quarter from the threat of Hurricane Dorian. Also recall, the prior year fourth quarter included the impact of Hurricane Michael, which resulted in additional portable generator shipments into the impacted region. Looking at our commercial and industrial products. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 declined 2.7% to $217.1 million as compared to $223.2 million in the prior-year quarter, prior-year quarter, with the core growth decline of approximately 3% when excluding the contribution from the Captive acquisition and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Domestically, shipments of C&I stationery products through our industrial distributors remained very strong as we continue to drive share gains across our product portfolio. This continued to trend that we have seen for all of 2019. Offsetting this growth was a decline in shipments to our telecom national account customers due to the combination of a very strong prior-year comparison coupled with certain customers taking a pause and capital spending during the current year quarter. Also shipments of C&I mobile products declined compared to prior-year as our national rental account customers continue to defer capital spending on the rental fleet. Internationally, our C&I products declined compared to the prior year on a core basis. As Aaron mentioned, we continue to experience a challenging environment with international as slower economic growth, trade conflicts and geopolitical headwinds our leading the softer demand in many of the key regions of the world in which we operate. Net sales for the other products and services category primarily made up of aftermarket service parts and product accessories, the amortization of extended warranty deferred revenue and the service offerings in various parts of our business, increased 10.8% to $51.3 million as compared to $46.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. A larger installed base of our products and higher levels of extended warranty revenue and services drove this increase versus the prior year. Gross profit margin improved 130 basis points to 37.6% compared to 36.3% in the prior-year fourth quarter. Despite the impact of higher regulatory tariffs and the unfavorable mix impact from recent acquisitions, we successfully expanded our gross margins in the current year quarter through pricing actions, cost reductions, favorable sales mix and lower realized commodity and currency input costs. Operating expenses increased $22.3 million or 23.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses excluding intangible amortization increased approximately 250 basis points versus the prior year as we continue to make important investments in a number of future growth opportunities for the Company. For example, a key driver of the increase in operating expenses is our entrance into and ramping up of our clean energy efforts this year, including the impact of acquisitions of Neurio and Pika. Another main driver is the addition of employee resources around strategic initiatives with a key focus on our connectivity, lead gas and beyond standby opportunities globally. We also continue to invest in developing new products and technologies, along with targeted spending on marketing content, campaigns and promotions to drive awareness of the home standby generator product category with an added focus on the California market. Finally, we incurred higher intangible amortization and depreciation expense given our acquisition activity and an increase in capital expenditures in recent years. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interests and as defined in our earnings release, was $129.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to $126.1 million in the same period last year. The corresponding adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.9% in the quarter as compared to 22.4% in the prior year. This margin decline was primarily driven by the increased operating expense investment previously discussed, partially offset by the improvement in gross margin, exclusive of various EBITDA add-backs. For the full year 2019, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interests came in at an all-time record of $454 million, resulting in an attractive 20.6% margin. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. We disclosed this morning that effective in the fourth quarter of 2019, we determine that the Latin American export operations of our legacy Generac business to be included in the International reportable segment. Previously, these results were reported in the Domestic segment in amounts that were not material. Accordingly, we have updated the net sales and adjusted EBITDA by segment included within the supplemental schedules of our press release. The change increased the net sales and adjusted EBITDA for the International segment by immaterial amounts while reducing the net sales and adjusted EBITDA for the Domestic segment by the same amounts. With that said, Domestic segment sales increased 7.7% to $470.1 million as compared to $436.3 million in the prior-year quarter, which includes $7.2 million of contribution from recent acquisitions, resulting in core growth of approximately 6%. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter was $122.9 million or 26.1% of net sales as compared to $116.3 million in the prior year or 26.7% of net sales. For the full year 2019, Domestic segment sales increased 11.3% over the prior year with core sales growth of approximately 10%. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment were approximately flat versus prior year at 24.6%. International segment sales decreased 4.9% to $120.9 million as compared to $127.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Core sales declined approximately 4% versus prior-year when excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and the Captiva acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter before deducting for non-controlling interests was $6.2 million or 5.2% of net sales, as compared to $9.7 million or 7.7% of net sales in the prior year. For the full year 2019, International segment sales increased 1% over the prior year with the core sales decline of approximately 1%. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests were 5.5% of net sales during 2019, compared to 7.9% of net sales in the prior year. Now, switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2019 on a consolidated basis. GAAP net income attributable to the Company in the quarter was $69.6 million as compared to $75.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Included in the current year fourth quarter was a pre-tax settlement charge of $10.9 million related to the termination of the Company's domestic pension plan, which did not result in a reduction of benefits to plan participants. On a cash basis, we only incurred an incremental cash contribution of approximately $1 million during 2019 to settle our obligations under the plan. GAAP income taxes during the current year fourth quarter were $13.4 million for an effective tax rate of 16.1%, this compares to GAAP income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2018 of $20 million for an effective tax rate of 20.7%. The decline in tax rate was primarily related to a year-end revaluation adjustment related to a reduction in our state income tax rate. Diluted net income per share for the Company on a GAAP basis was $1.12 in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $1.20 in the prior year. Included in the current year quarter was $0.17 impact from the aforementioned pension settlement charge. Adjusted net income for the Company, as defined in our earnings release was $96.5 million in the current year quarter or $1.53 per share versus $88.1 million in the prior year or $1.42 per share. With regards to cash income taxes, the fourth quarter of 2019 includes the impact of cash income tax expense of $8.2 million as compared to $15.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The current year now reflects an expected cash income tax rates of 15% for the full year 2019 as compared to our previous expectation of 17%. The prior year fourth quarter was also based on an expected cash tax rate of 15% for the full year 2018. Recall that every dollar of pre-tax earnings over and beyond our $30 million tax yield is now tax - expected GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%. Cash flow from operations was $175.1 million as compared to $108.2 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. And free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was $160.3 million as compared to $87.3 million in the same quarter last year. The significant monetization of previous working capital investments along with lower capital expenditures were the primary drivers of the strong improvement in cash flow compared to the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow for the full year 2019 was an all-time record of $250.7 million as compared to $203.6 million for 2018. Uses of cash during 2019 included $112 million for acquisitions, $61 million for capital expenditures and $38 million for net repayment of debt. Taking a look at our balance sheet, on January 1, 2019, we adopted the new GAAP lease accounting standard. This new standard requires that we recognized the right of use assets and leased liabilities related to operating leases on our balance sheet. As a result, we recognized approximately $40 million of additional other assets and other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet in Q1 to adopt the new standard. As of December 31, 2019, we had $323 million of cash on hand, and there was approximately $269 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility, which matures in the year 2023. We had a total of $899 million of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original discount and deferred financing costs. On December 13, 2019, the Company amended its term loan credit agreement, which among other things, extended the maturity of the term loan from May 2023 to December 2026. As part of the amendment, the Company paid down $49 million of debt on the term loan. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.0 times on an as-reported basis. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our outlook for 2020.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks York. We are initiating guidance for the full year 2020 and expect continued strong revenue growth highlighted by the rapidly expanding clean energy in California markets for our energy technology products and solutions. For the full year, net sales are expected to increase between 6% to 8% compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis and 5% to 7% on a core growth basis. Importantly, this guidance assumes a level of power outages during the year in line with the longer-term baseline average. But given the high likelihood of a significant power shut off event in California, again in 2020, we have included the benefit of one of these events in our guidance. However, consistent with our historical approach, this outlook does not assume the benefit of a major power outage event during the year, such as a category three or higher landed hurricane. Incremental to our baseline revenue guidance, should there be a major event during 2020 along with any additional power shut-offs in California, we could expect approximately 3% to 5% of additional revenue growth, resulting in an upside case as reported sales growth of - between 9% and 13%. From a seasonality perspective, we are anticipating normal historical trends for the year. Specifically, our baseline guidance assumes net sales in the first half are projected to be approximately 45% of full-year revenue with the second half expected to be approximately 55%. Year-over-year growth is forecasted to be in the low-single digits in the first quarter, as the demand softness with telecom and international is anticipated to continue in the near term, but growth is expected to accelerate during the second quarter. Our upside case scenario, should it occur is more likely to take place during the second half of the year where the probabilities increase for additional significant outage activity such as a major landed hurricane or additional power shut-offs during the wildfire season in California. Using our baseline guidance for 2020 net sales, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are expected to be approximately 20% in spite of the significant ramp of clean energy during the year, which is projected to have an approximate 125 basis point dilutive impact on margins for the full year. Additionally, assuming our upside case revenue guidance, adjusted EBITDA margins could incrementally increase by approximately 50 basis points over the baseline guidance to 20.5%. Consistent with historical seasonality, assuming our baseline guidance, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the second half of the year to be higher relative to the first half with the sequential improvement being approximately 500 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to sequentially improve through the year as we work to reduce the cost structure of our energy storage products, realize additional savings from our profitability enhancement program and improve leverage of our operating expenses through the higher top line. Specifically for the first quarter, margins are expected to be the lowest for the year, but similar to the prior year first quarter when excluding the impact of clean energy, which is expected to have a significant dilutive impact during the quarter of more than 200 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA margins are then anticipated to show a meaningful sequential improvement during the second quarter and further improvement during the second half of 2020. I'd now like to hand the call back over to York to walk through some additional guidance details for 2020. York?
York Ragen: Thanks again, Aaron. As is our normal practice, we are providing additional guidance details to assist with modeling adjusted earnings and free cash flow for 2020. Please note, these additional items assume our baseline guidance case for the year. For 2020, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to increase to between 23.5% to 24% as compared to 21.1% for full year rate 2019. Based on our guidance provided for 2020, our cash income tax expense for the year is expected to be approximately $55 million to $59 million, which translates into an anticipated full year 2020 cash income tax rate of between 15.5% to 16.5%, as compared to 15% rate for the full year 2019. As a reminder, we still have a favorable tax shield as a result of a significant intangible amortization deduction in our corporate tax return that results in our cash income tax rate being notably lower than our GAAP income tax rate. The tax affected annual value of this tax shield is expected to be approximately $30 million per year and expires fully in 2021. In 2020, we expect interest expense to be approximately $37 million to $38 million, assuming no additional principal payments during the year and flat LIBOR rates throughout 2020. Our capital expenditures for 2020 reflect continued investments in expanding capacity and are forecasted to be approximately 2.5% of our forecasted net sales for the year. Depreciation expense is forecast to be approximately $33 million to $34 million in 2020 given our assumed CapEx guidance. GAAP and intangible amortization expense in 2020 is expected to be approximately $31 million to $32 million during the year. Stock compensation expense is expected to be $18 million to $19 million in 2020. For full-year 2020, operating and free cash flow generation is once again expected to be strong and follow historical seasonality, benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow expected to be approximately 90% in 2020. Finally, our full-year diluted share count is expected to increase and be approximately 64 million shares, this compares to 62.9 million shares in 2019. This 2020 outlook does not reflect potential business acquisitions or stock buybacks. Given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we have significant resources to drive further shareholder value as we execute on our long-term strategic priorities. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn: So for the 150 megawatts for clean energy coverage, curious how you're seeing the relative value on this initial trust from your captive legacy channels in dealers versus partnerships that are peculiar just to this category for you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Chris, it's a great question. Obviously, we think that we're going to be able to tap our existing distribution channels for clean energy opportunities in the future. And in fact, we were - we had our annual conference with all of our distribution partners down in Orlando, last week. We had over 3,000 people there, representing about 1,500 dealers. And so the products were incredibly well-received. We talked about not only the product, the technology and a lot of the programs around that, but I think one of the things it's very evident to us that the typical dealer for us is a small electrical contractor, that's about 85% of the channel for us. And I think most of those contractors would tell you privately that this is pretty new stuff for them, right. They haven't dealt with a lot of the clean energy technology. Some of them have. They're perfectly comfortable with solar and even some comfortable storage. Storage has been so thinly penetrated to this point that it's really new for everybody. But what we're seeing out of 150 megawatts, to answer your question more directly is that that's coming from a lot of the new channel partners that we've picked up, so there is - there are a number of distributor companies that are involved in the clean energy space to distribute all the components necessary to build out a system, whether that be a solar array, or whether that be the storage system itself. And so we've been very successful garnering interest of new customers, which is great because obviously, we want to tap into our legacy channel too, but one of the things we want to do is also grow a new channel. So I think over time, as our traditional channels, if we can call on that get more comfortable with the technology and they do a few installs, they get a few under their belt that will accelerate. I think initially, it's going to be a little bit slower ramp, not maybe slower than our expectations. It's just we expected it to be slow. It's difficult to take a small business like a small electrical contractor and give them something that new and have them be comfortable out of the box with it. So that they'll get there like it's just like home standby really 20 years ago. Now, we don't want to take 20 years and I don't think it well, but because the market is going to move a lot faster than that. But a lot of that is coming from new channel partners, which is great.
Christopher Glynn: And then I had a question on core home standby. I think you mentioned the Northeast wasn't as strong as some other areas. So I'm wondering if you've seen some states or regions kind of fundamentally move past peak and penetration, but that shifting to other regions, if you just kind of speak to that notion.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I think what - again the Northeast notwithstanding, right. I mean the Northeast was up really big after a couple of major events in 2011-2012, nor'easters in '20 - I think that was in '20 - early 2018. We had some nor'easter type storms like three or four of them in a row. So the nor'easter is interesting. And it's softened after those major events in 2011 and 2012. After growing off of a massive base and it's softened, but into a range that was materially higher than the baseline before those events. Then it picked back up again with the nor'easters in 2018. So we're kind of comping - for full year '19, we're comping those nor'easters with the Northeast, that was the only region that was down. And when we look across all the regions for our activations, which is amazing. The broad-based strength in the category continues to surprise even us, honestly. It's a function of again additional points of light in distribution that we put out there, the breadth of our product offering, the aggressiveness of our marketing - with the direct targeted marketing that we do for home standby is we spend a lot of money, we spend a lot of time and we generated a lot of leads. So as I said in the prepared remarks, 2019 was the highest year ever for our in-home consultations - a number of in-home consultations. IHC has reached record levels. So I think there's always going be some puts and takes, right. You're going to have difficult comps off of peaks and they come back around. But I think what's really impressive to us is the broad-based strength that we see generally regionally, and then obviously the West based on our prepared remarks was off the hook as they say. It was crazy good, so.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Ross Gilardi: Aaron, I just want to ask, I mean look, your stock's obviously soaring, you got a $7 billion market cap right now. Your leverage is low. You're generating a lot of cash. What is in you're clearly very optimistic about the clean energy business? What's your appetite for a larger clean energy storage acquisition? And what do you tolerate a year or two of earnings dilution if something was out there that really bolstered your long-term position and you felt like it was the right thing to do for the Company?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean obviously it's something we're talking a lot about, Ross. The fact that - obviously, the stock has performed well, of course, and I think the business - the prospects for our business have never been brighter. As I said, we tapped into, I think some really big megatrends here at the Company relative to the changing utility landscape. This - we're calling it an energy revolution here internally that - and we view those comments externally with our channel partners and others that, there are going to be a lot of changes ahead. And with all those changes ahead, I think that as we look at - and obviously, we don't comment specifically on our M&A funnel, but we're looking at a lot of things in that funnel that I would say are different from what we would have looked at historically, bigger things, things that are obviously fit in with the clean energy space. There's - it's changed our gaze if you will, in terms of where we look and the size of the things that we look at. Now, we're still looking at a lot of different potential bolt-on acquisitions to that build out some of our platforms and maybe fully can round out some things that were already working on. But there are some technology players out there. I just - I think we're in a great position, right. Obviously, the strength of our balance sheet, York and the team getting done with the - they went through in it, amended and extended the - our credit agreement, again here gave us just a fantastic liability structure for a number of years through 2023, so we're - 2026, excuse me, so we're in a really, really good shape there. So we're looking at a lot of things. And again, I can't comment specifically, but I'm excited about the future and I'm excited that we're in a position where we can capitalize on that future.
Ross Gilardi: The dilution aspect of that, Aaron, can you comment at all, how to think about that, like would you - clearly, you guys have got very high margins in your overall business stemming from standby, how would you consider that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Obviously, dilution we think about it, but look, that doesn't scare us. Think of all the things that we've done with the high margin profile we have, honestly, it's very difficult to find anything to buy that would not be dilutive. That's been the challenge is everything - our margins, we've got great margins and we've got a great position in the marketplace. It's difficult to find things that become accretive to margins. If they're strategic and they are incremental, and they make - frankly, they fit well with our views on the future, which I guess you could call strategy, strategic thinking then we'll do it. And if that means we have to suffer through some dilution for a period of time and we've done this, right. I mean some of the acquisitions - some of the larger acquisitions we've done over the years have had exactly that impact. Even the clean acquisitions we did last year, right. I mean we spent $100 million-plus on Pika and Neurio. And as we said in the prepared remarks, that is having a drag on EBITDA margins, you know, is that I think we said something like 50 basis points last year and this year it's going to be 125 basis points all-in, and out of the gate, Q1 it's going to be 200 basis points. So it's going to improve as the cost structure improves of those products and as we scale. But dilution doesn't scare me because I know long-term, I know what our capabilities are and we've proven this. With all the things that we've done, here we are. We're still at basic with the same margins we've been at over the course of the last five, six, seven years. So I'm okay with that.
Ross Gilardi: Especially if we have a path to improve margins over time.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You have to have that. Obviously, you have to have that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Philip Shen: Congrats on the NOVA deal.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks. Yeah.
Philip Shen: Yes, that's a big one. There are few solar leasing companies out there, in general, can you talk about how you ended up with NOVA, specifically in an exclusive? And can you share how the agreement is structured, possibly? Is it like a typical dealer? Are there any upfront payments from the other party? Did the geographic footprint, for example, serve as a key driver in the decision? I know they have a presence in Puerto Rico and other islands, how important was that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Great question, Phil. We're really excited about the partnership with Sunnova. And we're thrilled that they've selected us as their partner. And the exclusivity really is related to the financing arrangement that they can offer. They've got some pretty great financing packages and pretty unique approach to that. Others have different packages as well and we have talked to - really, we're talking to the entire industry because we think we've got a great story to tell in terms of the technology - the storage technology. And really maybe even more importantly, we probably don't talk enough about this, the monitoring technology that we've got and the energy management technologies that we're working on, and we're going to put together and have been putting together in our PWRcell storage system. Sunnova was just the first one to sign up with us on this program and on this path. I mean we're talking to others. We're going to work with the - as many partners that want to work with us. And those larger partners represent about 30% of the market. And then I think our focus obviously, where we think we really can have an impact is in the independent channel. We think we can bring a lot of unique solutions, tools and a value proposition for the independent channel, that is something that they've not seen before, up until this point. We can give them a turnkey solution with power inversion, with storage, all the power electronics, the optimizers on the rooftop, and we can put all of that in one package. And it's basically under one brand and we can give that to them, and we can offer them that in a unique way. So again, we're not trying to limit ourselves in any one way. The exclusivity was really about the financing arrangement with Sunnova. Again, really excited about that. I'm not going to comment on the specifics of the financing package itself. One reason, I'm not as well versed in the details of the financing packages as others are. But obviously, Phil, we can take you offline. We can get you more comfortable with that as well going forward here. But we're really super excited about NOVA and our partnership, and looking forward to that growth as we expand our efforts here with clean energy.
Philip Shen: And the geographic footprint impact that decision given their presence in Puerto Rico and other island, countries or territories?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I mean it is because we look at - obviously, we're looking at what everybody else looks at is where are the biggest opportunity sets for us to go after. And you look at the islands, you look at - in the Caribbean, you look at Puerto Rico and the places where NOVA has a stronger footprint. It fits really well with some of the areas that are projected to have some of the heaviest growth going forward and then our - where penetration rates and attach - more importantly, where attachment rates for storage make the most sense. And that's really - you know, it's - that is a part of this, and one of the reasons why I think both Sunnova and us want to get going on this because we both see attachment rates for storage increasing at a really decent clip here in 2020. And I think the - them having additional storage partners that can bring a unique solution like we have I think is attractive for them and for their customer base.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.
Jeff Hammond: So just on the guidance, it seems like most - most to all of the organic growth is coming from the energy storage and maybe some growth in California. So just maybe talk about how you're thinking about home standby outside of California for the year, and just maybe the moving pieces in the C&I, mobile, telecom et cetera?
York Ragen: Yes. Hi, Jeff. This is York. Yeah. So I think you're right. Looking at the guide our core growth rate of 5% to 7%, a large percentage of that will be the clean growth and California growth. Home standby, we are projecting it to be up modestly. I think we always have this challenge every year when we guide, especially our baseline guidance when we don't assume any type of major outage events from Mother Nature. We tend to guide modestly - modest growth on the residential side. Home standby again would be up modestly. Portables without an event, we did sell a number of portables - of $30 million portables as a result of Hurricane Dorian, last year. That wouldn't repeat, so a little bit of a headwind there, but we think we can make up for that with some home standby. On the C&I side, looking at low-single-digit growth, I think that start out the year a little slower, telecom and international, and will probably continue its trends that we're seeing here in Q4, into the first quarter. But we expect that to pick up in the second half. Overall for the year, looking at C&I, may be in that low-single-digit growth range. So when you put it altogether outside of California clean, roughly flat to slightly up, and then we've got that 3% to 5% upside, should we get some major events in 2020.
Jeff Hammond: And then what's - I think you said you think you're going to put in 150-megawatt hours up from a 100-megawatt. Can you just talk about what's informing that delta? Is it the Sunnova? Is it order rates to date? And just how you think your supply chain is reacting as you kind of ratchet up those expectations? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. And obviously, Jeff, you follow the Company for a long time, so you know we don't do that lightly, right? We don't just increase the guide like that until we generally have pretty decent viewpoints on that in terms of just our available kind of knowledge that we have in front of us here. And that's a combination of all the things you mentioned. I mean, obviously, we're excited about the Sunnova opportunity. We - also, as I said previously, we've signed on a couple of larger distributor partners that we haven't done press releases on but they are important meaningful distributors in the space that we're really excited to be partnered with as well. So it's a combination of those kind of partnerships that we've nailed down. We've got pretty good visibility with incoming order rate so far, some backlog. And that's what's informing kind of our views on this. And then obviously, there are some broader overall market trends. As I said, storage attachment rates being higher and headed higher. And our longer-term view and this may not be as much around the guide change from 100-megawatts to 150-megawatts, as much as it is our views longer-term. But the intensification around storage going forward is going to be - we believe is going to be meaningful. And whether that happens, you know, in the current year or it happens in some future period, storage is going to play an incredibly important role in this push towards renewable energy. And the ability to use that storage and smaller form factors at homes and businesses, the improved cost structure of that product as a result of the push towards larger format storage to support utilities and utility-scale for the push towards renewables is going to be a net positive long-term. And that's why all the trajectory I look the way they do for storage. On the supply chain side, we're working really hard to bring that supply chain on board. There was an existing supply chain. It wasn't like we're starting from scratch, but we have had to expand things very quickly. Now, thankfully, we have a very deep supply chain already for our legacy products and there are a lot of things that look similar to that. Aside from the basic battery pack themselves, a lot of the power electronics and components, the boxes that these things go in, all the other kind of elements of this are a lot like other components that we source today for our legacy products. So we're able to introduce the Pika and Neurio teams to our existing supply channel - supply chain partners. And we've been very successful converting some of their existing suppliers over to new supply base quickly. And we're optimistic that we're going to stay on that track. But as we've said in previous comments, this is more of a supply-side challenge for the year than it is the demand side, in our view. We think the demand side is, it feels pretty good. We have good visibility, feels really firm and that's why we took the guide up. And we think our supply chain is going to be able to meet that. And obviously, that's why we took the number up the way we did. But it's going to be - we're going to be chasing that all year long.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Stanley Elliott: Sticking on the supply chain, is there any concerns, impact of the virus from China? And how that would impact your ability to get the products through over the course of the year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean, obviously, there's probably not a company that isn't thinking about this. And we've got - we've actually got operations in China as well. We've got a facility in Southern China. We have a technical center outside of Shanghai. So we have a fair amount of employees over there as well. So it's interesting because you get a lot of mixed signals right now that some facilities have started back up, including our own. We've restarted our facility in Southern China because we're not directly in a quarantine zone. But there are other facilities that have been told that they can't start for another week or two. So it's kind of a --a mixed kind of bag in terms of capacity right now. I think the next couple of weeks are going to be really critical. I think what I can tell you, Stanley is the one thing we have assessed is there's not going be an impact to our Q1. So Q1, we feel good about being able to satisfy kind of where we're guiding here for Q1. And Q2, we're going to come into the quarter in pretty good shape because we'll be building for a season at this point. I think where we'll run into our first problems if we run into them at all, are going to be on the operational side of our business, which is we'll just - we may - this air pocket that might get created here, normally we - we're kind of in an interesting situation because we were buying ahead anyway to cover the Chinese New Year period like everybody does. And we always go a little stronger because you never know it used to be that suppliers didn't get the same level of people returning after Chinese New Year, so their output was usually a little constrained after the New Year. But I think we're in a pretty - we feel like we're of a decent spot right now for the next, call it 60 days. And - but the next couple of weeks are going to be really critical to really assessing the full impact that this might have on the rest of the year. But Q1 seems safe. But after that, it's a matter of what happens next.
Stanley Elliott: Yes. That sounds fair. And a lot of moving parts, unfortunately. Switching gears onto the telecom side, with the Sprint, T-Mobile, is that - as you guys have internally gameplay, is that good for the business telecom? Or is it possibly push out some of the backup generators installs that you would expect to see given they'll be working through the M&A logistics?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I think the actual deal itself getting approved. We actually think it's a good thing, right. It just takes away the uncertainty that surrounded that. So that I would put a check in the positive column. I think on the other side of the ledger, you have the fact that as our prepared remarks indicated and we're going to start out the year a little bit slow with telecom. There's a bit of an air pocket here on - in terms of the cycles of capital spending. And we've seen this forever in this industry. There just - there is green light, red light, green light, red light. It can be lumpy. We were - last year, overall telecom demand was greater than the previous year, but it's slowed down later in 2019. And that slowness has continued here in early 2020. So without getting into the specifics of kind of which carriers are causing that, because we don't like to talk directly about individual customers, but I think that we're - the long-term prospects here are immense, and the 5G technology is game-changing. The amount of stuff that, that's going to enable from drone delivery to automated driving to the robotic surgery, all these super high-functioning technologies are going to require a consistent 5G connection. And that consistent 5G connection is going to only come from a site that has consistent power. And so the penetration rate of backup power at cell sites is going to have to improve - is going to have to increase dramatically. And so I - we just don't think there's any question about it. It's not a question of if. It's only a question of when. And so - but the when has been the challenging part, right. It's been a lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And the first half of this year, - first couple of quarters of this year, Phil, at least right now based on the visibility we have, and again, we've always said this, we don't get great visibility out of those guys, but it could change tomorrow. But at least at the visibility, we have today, we think it's going to start off, kind of like 2019 ended a little slow.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Brian Drab: In your longer-term guide at the Analyst Day, and I just want to kind of try to put a finer point slightly on the clean energy outlook. But you talked at the Analyst Day about clean energy, potentially accounting for about 2 points of growth through 2022, and it was somewhat back-end loaded in your mind at the time, I believe. But is it fair to assume at this point that number one, the 2 points through 2022 is conservative? And number two, that maybe you can get 2 points already in 2020 from clean energy?
York Ragen: Yes. Brian, it's York. I think you're right. We - I think - as Aaron said, I think our expectations with clean have far exceeded what we had originally thought. And I'm thinking into that September 4, Investor Day. These 150-megawatt hours that we are looking to deploy in 2020, that is - that's probably three times more than what we were thinking. And now, I don't know how that's going to transpose or extrapolate into where we think that will be three years from now. But --
Aaron Jagdfeld: But it's off faster.
York Ragen: …it's off a lot faster, so we expect to see some nice growth in 2020 overall for the Company related to clean. And that's a lot better than expectation, back when we talked during the Investor Day.
Brian Drab: So it sounds like maybe it could be even more than 2 points of growth next year if it's triple…
York Ragen: Yes. Based on the math that - yes.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's going to be quite a bit better than that, Brian.
Brian Drab: Yes.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And again I think just - I think it's - you hate to say this as a CEO but it almost feels like we've caught lightning in a bottle here in terms of our timing and in terms of our - the companies that we acquired, I think were the right companies we acquired. I think it was the right time to enter the space. And everything we see is - has punctuated by just a lot of energy, no pun intended around storage and around our entry into it, specifically, our brand, the things that we can bring to that market with our distribution, our selling systems, our targeted marketing. And nobody has done that. And I think there's just a lot of optimism from the channel partners that we've engaged with already, including people like Sunnova where we've announced partnerships that we're super excited. I mean, we're playing an infomercial already on clean energy and we're making the phone ring. And we've got people that were we're talking to, we're creating sales leads at a cost per sale that materially lower than what the solar plus storage industry has historically seen from a customer acquisition cost standpoint. So we just see a lot of room to run with that and I think that's reflective of our optimism in the guidance.
Brian Drab: And then just quickly, I joined a little late given an overlapping call. But did you mention the total dealer count as you exited 2019, and what the growth was there for the year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It was about 6,500 dealers, Brian. And that's a 500 dealer add year-over-year.
Brian Drab: Yes.
Aaron Jagdfeld: I can only remember, maybe one other year in my career here where we had that many new dealers. So it will - that has, as you guys know when we expand the dealer base that much, that'll have a meaningful impact in the future. I mean there is no doubt that that is something that factors into the future - potential growth for home standby.
Operator: And our final question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich: On the battery storage increased target, really nice to see folks getting that much traction. Can you just talk about your anticipated mix of channel? And are you anticipating any significant further announcements of distribution arrangements with Tier 1 installers to get to the 150-megawatt number you mentioned earlier on the call?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I think, Jerry, we've been assessing kind of the distribution - the path to market here with the distribution. And as I've said before, the market the way it's - it kind of breaks out about 30% of the solar market non-speaking and again storage is pretty nascent still in comparison. But 30% of call it clean-energy type of distribution has done through larger companies like Sunnova, like the one that we partnered with. And the other - the remaining 70% is really done through independent dealers, so smaller contractors either specifically involved in clean energy or in some cases may be electrical contractors like we would have as dealers. We've got some dealers who are involved in that and will be part of that independent channel. I think, you know, longer-term, I think that we would look at our sales spread, just kind of mirroring that maybe overweighting the independent channel a little bit, given our the value prop that we bring to the independents in terms of the fact that we're going to have a selling system. And again, it's very similar to - with the selling system we have in our legacy products with home standby. It's called PowerPlay. We call it PowerPlay CE. And PowerPlay CE really starts at the sizing of the rooftop solar array. So we've made an investment in a Company there to help us with that. And they kind of plug-in on the front end of PowerPlay CE, and help the independent contractor take that through to a final proposal, and obviously, focused on adding storage along the way, in that proposal. And then you're being able to offer some financing and other things. But basically, as I said previously, kind of a one-stop-shop. A lot of the independent channels, the way they approach the market before - I've been using this phrase internally. I don't know if it's others are or if it's popular or not, but they kind of radio shack it, right. They go out and they buy all the pieces and parts that they needed. They come to your house, they size your - the solar array that you needed, and they do that in a very kind of rule of thumb manner, in a very kind of informal manner. They produce a kind of a handwritten proposal for you, and then they go by all the pieces and parts that they need from either the distributors that serve that channel or maybe if they're large enough they're able to buy from some OEMs direct. But they had to kind of cobble together systems. They really had to be engineers in a lot of cases to put these systems together. The prospect of working with somebody that can deliver a turnkey solution for them really takes a lot of the guesswork out of it, takes a lot of the engineering out of it. And we're going to stand behind it with a single warranty across the entire package. And I think that, that is at least in our early discussions with many of the channel partners, that is a really exciting prospect for them because it simplifies things. And we haven't found a channel partner yet, that doesn't like to have to think simplified. So we're excited that we're going to be able to do that. And I think it's a big part of - I think the value that we're going to bring to that independent channel.
Jerry Revich: And in terms of the cost per lead that you alluded to earlier, can you just talk about how it compares and the storage business compared to the legacy standby business, just to give us a bit more context on how that's tracking? And if you can comment on close rates as well, that would be helpful.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So our legacy, - I'll start with our legacy costs, they're down to all-time lows in 2019. Again we had all-time highs at the number of IHCs we drove, the number of appointments - the times we made the phone ring, we turn those into appointments, the highest close rate we ever had also in 2019. So when you convert that to a cost-per-sale, we're at, really low levels or historically low levels compared to when we rolled the program out in 2014. On the flip side of that, obviously, it's brand new with what we're doing with clean energy. So we've really dialed in over the last six years - five or six years, the legacy product in terms of the media that we buy, the times that we buy, where we kind of air it, the demographics, DMAs that we focus on. And we're working through that with clean energy. We just got on the air in mid-January, quite 30 days yet. But what we're impressed by is the fact that we're making the phone rings. And probably even more impressive interestingly enough is kind of a side comment. There's a lot of people calling just because it's our brand. We're getting people calling asking for home standby, in some cases. So I think the power of the brand has been really interesting to us. I mean we - Generac, we always - we never thought of Generac as a household brand. We just - but what we've done over the last decade to build that brand into something that means something in the eyes of a customer, certainly in terms of backup power. And what we're trying to do in the future to put that brand in the context of something that's in that energy ecosystem in the home or the business. When you think of your home's energy supply today, you really don't think of any brand other than your local utility. So you don't think about the brand on your distribution panel, you don't think of the brand of the breakers, the Romex, the plugs and switches, everything else, the lights and everything else that are in your home. We think that we can change that. We think that we can make Generac the brand you think of when you think of power in your home. And we're going to do that in a number of different ways. We're going to be out in front again with generation - power generation, with power storage, with energy storage, with energy monitoring and with energy management. We think that those four core components and being involved in those four components in the home or the business is going to put the brand in a very powerful position going forward. So anyway, we're not - we're going to bring the cost down overall, as we go forward here and we dial-in. Our media spend is higher than our legacy costs, as you would imagine, but it's still materially lower than what the industry has told us it cost them on a per-sale basis to acquire a customer.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mike Harris, for any closing remarks.
Michael Harris: We want to thank, everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to discussing our first quarter earnings results with you in late April. Thank you again and goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 Generac Holdings Incorporation's Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.
York Ragen: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call back over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you, York. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter results represent a continuation to the strong start we experienced this year in the first half and are the best quarterly numbers we've ever had as a company. Strong domestic sales growth of 9.2% was driven by our residential and industrial stationary power generation markets again during the quarter with overall net sales increasing approximately 7% compared to the prior year. EBITDA margins remained strong at 21% as we have been largely successful mitigating the impact of regulatory tariffs. Increases in power outage activity over the last several years together with the threat of potential outages in California drove continued penetration gains in home standby generators during the quarter. Shipments of stationary C&I products were also significantly higher year-over-year as demand for natural gas generators and telecom-related backup power more than offset softer shipments of mobile products as a number of our larger rental customers continue to defer certain fleet purchases. Once again, demand for home standby generators remained very strong during the quarter. Activations and in-home consultations were again robust with proposal close rates, which have been trending higher for the last several years at all-time highs as we continue to refine our sales and marketing processes. Additionally, we added approximately 200 new dealers during the quarter as we stayed intensely focused on developing this important channel to increase the sales, installation and service bandwidth needed to further expand penetration rates for the category. Over the last two decades, we have invested heavily to create the home standby generator market as our efforts to develop distribution, create targeted marketing and deploy in-home selling processes have dramatically increased the overall awareness and growth of the category. We estimate the market today is more than $1 billion annually and with penetration rates of single-family unattached homes in the U.S. only at 4.5%, there remains plenty of room for this market to grow. Recall that every 1% of penetration represents $2 billion of additional market opportunity at retail prices. Power outages have steadily increased in frequency and duration over the last 25 years, primarily due to under-investment in the electrical grid which has left it more vulnerable to the increasingly unpredictable and more severe weather patterns that are being driven by a change in climate. In addition to the direct impacts from severe weather that cause power outages, the indirect effects of an increase in the conditions that cause wildfires is creating a much higher level of interest in backup power, as utility companies have announced their intentions to shutdown huge portions of their service areas to prevent their equipment from potentially causing a catastrophic fire. In California where penetration rates of home standby generators stand at less than 1%, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of in-home consultations and other leading indicators that continue to point to the rapid expansion of this market. Over the last three weeks, local utilities have triggered numerous shut-offs impacting millions of customers as they seek to mitigate the risk of wildfires. These shut-offs have been multi-day events and are projected to continue in the years ahead as the impact of climate change and the massive under-investment in Northern California's power grid have combined to create a situation where public safety takes precedence over power quality.As a result, we're working to drive awareness of home standby generators in this part of the country, through television and digital advertising to promote the category. As we have previously noted, we have relatively underdeveloped distribution in this region, which could limit our ability to satisfy the increase in demand in the near term as we work to qualify, train and on-board new channel partners across the state. As is the case with most major power outage events, expanding distribution and working together with local regulators, inspectors and gas utilities to increase their bandwidth and sense of urgency around improving and providing the infrastructure necessary for this product category are critical for future growth. This is typical of markets that are developing, and to quicken the pace, we have an incredible team of people working in the region to assist the residents of California as they look for solutions to deal with future extended outages. Based on the scale of the power shut-offs experienced to date, we estimate the impact of these events could add more than $50 million of sales in the current year off of relatively small base, which is roughly double our original projection. As we continue to develop awareness and distribution in the region and if public safety shut-offs remain a concern for Californians, we believe the total market for backup power in the state could potentially be as high as $200 million annually in the years ahead. Our efforts in this part of the country will also be helpful in developing the market for energy monitoring, management and storage. Recall that earlier this year, we entered this nascent, but fast growing market with our acquisitions of Pika Energy and Neurio Technologies. We believe the energy landscape will undergo significant changes in the decade ahead as a result of rising utility rates, grid stability issues, environmental concerns and the continuing performance and cost improvements in renewable energy and batteries. On-site power generation from solar, wind, geothermal and natural gas generators will become more prevalent as will the need to manage, monitor and store this power, potentially developing into a multi-billion dollar market opportunity annually. The combination of Pika's power electronics battery management software and proprietary inverter technologies alongside Neurio's hardware and software for energy monitoring and management will allow us to bring an intelligent and efficient energy saving solution to this exciting new market and should solidify Generac's position as a key participant. Although very different from the extended emergency backup power space we serve today, we believe the energy storage market will develop similarly as the home standby market did over the past two decades. Our efforts to develop omni-channel distribution, targeted consumer-based marketing content and proprietary in-home sales tools have played a critical role in creating the market for home standby generators and we believe they will be equally important as we work to grow the energy management and energy storage markets. We recently announced a minority investment in Sofdesk, a Canadian software company focused on developing sales acceleration tools for the solar industry. The company's flagship product Solargraf is an all-in-one software tool used by solar installers for lead management, array design and proposal creation as well as permitting and overall project management. We intend to fully integrate these capabilities with elements of our proprietary PowerPlay sale system to create PowerPlay CE, the industry's first complete solar plus storage sales and lead management tool for installers and dealers. In September, we launched PowerPlay CE as well as our new Generac branded intelligent storage system called PWRcell at the Solar Power International Show in Salt Lake City. Our entry into this market has been incredibly well received to date, and we believe our clean energy efforts could materialize much more quickly than we had originally anticipated. As a result, we are aggressively working to expand our supply chain capacity with the intent to ship well in excess of 100 megawatt hours of storage as early as next year, more than doubling our initial second year projection for this business. In addition to our efforts to expand the residential side of our business during the quarter, our commercial and industrial generator business also grew again with another strong quarter, driven by a number of important secular themes, which continue to develop. Shipments of generators to telecom customers were higher again in the third quarter as wireless carriers further built out and hardened their existing networks as they prepare for the impending deployment of 5G technology. The need for a continuous supply of power to wireless sites will become even more crucial as faster speeds and increased bandwidth will enable a number of impactful mission critical technologies in the future. Generac is a key supplier of backup power systems to every single Tier 1 carrier in the U.S. and is also the largest provider of backup power for the telecom market in Latin America. Combined with our efforts at Pramac in Europe, we believe we can become a leader globally in telecom backup power, similar to the leading position we have built in the Americas, as this key vertical begins another extended investment cycle in the years ahead. We have also worked hard over the years to promote the benefits of natural gas power generation as an alternative for diesel powered systems that have traditionally been used in emergency backup applications. Increased regulation around diesel emissions of driven prices higher for diesel generators and when combined with the inherent refueling drawback of these systems and additional environmental concerns, an opportunity has developed for natural gas fuel generators as a cleaner and better alternative. We believe the natural gas has many superior characteristics when used to generate power with its abundant supply, low price, logistical advantages and environmental benefits, which have driven growth rates for gas generators that are twice that of diesel sets in the emergency backup power market over the last 25 years. We also see a developing opportunity for natural gas generators to be used in certain grid support applications beyond traditional standby power such as demand response programs, which are used to help utilities better balance the supply of power with demand. A gas generator used in a limited fashion for emergency backup could be deployed and managed by the end user, the local utility or a third-party aggregator as a decentralized power generation asset. The production of power onsite for local consumption or for export to the grid is not a new concept, but the economics of using natural gas and reciprocating engine-driven genset for this purpose have become more attractive in recent years, as utility rates rise and natural gas prices remain low.  In response, we are focused on expanding and tailoring our gas generator product offering for these types of projects and we are adding sales, engineering and project management resources to effectively develop and participate in these new applications globally. Although, we continue to see solid domestic demand for stationary C&I products, shipments for mobile products were lower again during the third quarter mainly due to the continuing reduction of capital spending by certain national rental account customers. Partially offsetting the lower shipments for these customers in the quarter were increased equipment purchases from independent and specialty rental businesses. In our view, the longer-term need for increased levels of spending on infrastructure projects in the U.S. is an important theme that remains intact. And we believe this will translate into greater demand for mobile products in the years ahead. Internationally, our business was roughly flat year-over-year as demand has softened in certain regions as a result of geopolitical risks, trade conflicts and other economic uncertainties. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the International segment were lower year-over-year in the quarter as unfavorable product mix, increased competitive pressures due to a slowing market, and higher operating expenses, negatively impacted margins for the segment. Although we are experiencing a challenging environment for our International business, we believe that longer term, our global presence will be important as interest in home standby and gas use generators for commercial and industrial applications continues to gain traction in many new markets around the world. In addition, we believe our international footprint will provide an important avenue for growth as we enter the clean energy space on a global basis. Overall, we have a path to improved profitability and we remain committed to our long-term targets of low double-digit EBITDA margins for this segment. I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our third quarter results. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Before discussing third quarter results in more detail, recall that effective January 1, 2018, Generac adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard. Upon finalizing our accounting under the new standard, at the end of 2018, we made certain immaterial prior-quarter reclassifications to our 2018 consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to extended warranties. Therefore, the prior period in our earnings release has been updated accordingly. See our press release for more information related to these reclassifications. Now looking at our third quarter 2019 results in more detail. Net sales for the quarter increased 6.9% to $601.1 million as compared to $562.4 million in the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the $4.8 million of contribution from the Captiva, Neurio and Pika acquisitions, and the almost $4 million negative impact from foreign currency, core growth rate during the quarter was still approximately 7%. Looking at our consolidated net sales by product class, residential product sales during the third quarter increased 7.4% to $335 million as compared to $311.9 million in the prior-year quarter, with core growth being approximately 7% when excluding the M&A contributions from Neurio and Pika and the slightly unfavorable impact from foreign currency. As Aaron mentioned, home standby generator sales experienced significant year-over-year growth as we continue to drive penetration of the product category. With power outages on the rise and interest in home standby generators at an all-time high, we have ramped-up our efforts to increase awareness, distribution and close rates for these products with particular focus in California. In addition, shipments of portable generators were similar to prior year aided by the impact of Hurricane Dorian which made a brief U.S. landfall in early September of this year. Recall that the prior-year period included the impact of Hurricane Florence, which also resulted in significant portable generator shipments into the impacted region. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales for the third quarter of 2019 increased 4.1% to $214.9 million as compared to $206.4 million in the prior-year quarter, with core growth being approximately 5% when excluding the M&A contribution from Captiva and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Domestically, we continue to see strong growth from our telecom customers as they invested in backup power for the cell towers to improve the reliability of their networks. In addition, shipments to our domestic industrial distributors also remain very strong, as we continue to drive share gains across our product portfolio. Partially offsetting this growth, shipments of C&I mobile products declined year-over-year as our national rental account customers continue to defer CapEx spending during the current year quarter. Internationally, our C&I products were approximately flat with prior year on a core basis. We have executed on a number of sales initiatives to drive penetration of our products across the globe. However, these strategic growth initiatives were largely offset by certain geopolitical headwinds resulting in economic softness in various regions around the world during the current year quarter. Net sales for the Other Products category, primarily made up of service parts and extended warranty sales increased 16.1% to $51.2 million as compared to $44.1 million in the third quarter of 2018. A larger installed base of our products and higher levels of extended warranty revenue drove this increase versus prior year. Gross profit margin was 36.2% compared to 35.6% in the prior year third quarter. We have successfully grown our gross margins as we more than offset higher regulatory tariffs with pricing actions, favorable sales mix and lower realized commodity and currency input costs. Operating expenses increased $18.1 million or 19.3% as compared to the third quarter of 2018. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses excluding intangible amortization increased approximately 170 basis points versus the prior year as we continue to focus on future growth opportunities for the company. Specifically, we continue to invest in additional employee resources to drive strategic growth around connectivity and lead gas opportunities globally. We are investing in marketing content, campaigns and promotions to drive awareness of the home standby generator product category with an added focus in the California market. Additionally, the incremental operating expenses from the recent acquisitions of Neurio and Pika have given us the R&D capabilities to enter the energy storage and energy management markets in a meaningful way. We believe these investments will be important drivers of future growth. Adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interests, and as defined in our earnings release, was $126 million in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to $124.5 million in the same period last year. The corresponding adjusted EBITDA margin was 21% in the quarter, as compared to 22.1% in the prior year. This margin decline was primarily driven by the increased operating expense investment previously discussed. Over the last 12 months, adjusted EBITDA was $451 million. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 9.2% to $498.2 million as compared to $456.1 million in the prior-year quarter, which includes $3.1 million of contribution from recent acquisitions. As previously discussed, this year-over-year increase reflects strong end market conditions for our home standby and C&I stationary generators. Portable generator shipments were approximately flat despite a tough prior-year comparison. The Domestic segment growth was partially offset by lower shipments of C&I mobile products. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter was $121.2 million or 24.3% of net sales as compared to $117.1 million in the prior year or 25.7% of net sales. International segment sales decreased 3.1% to $103 million as compared to $106.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Core sales were approximately flat versus prior year when you exclude the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and the impact of the Captiva India acquisition. As previously mentioned, market share gains were fully offset by geopolitical headwinds, which caused economic softness in certain regions of the world. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter, before deducting for non-controlling interests, was $4.7 million or 4.6% of net sales as compared to $7.4 million or 6.9% of net sales in the prior year. Unfavorable sales mix and incremental operating expense investment contributed to this margin percent decline. Now, switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2019 on a consolidated basis, GAAP net income attributable to the Company in the quarter was $75.6 million as compared to $75.8 million in the third quarter of 2018. The incremental earnings from our top line sales growth was mostly offset by the additional OpEx investment previously discussed. GAAP income taxes during the current year quarter were $20.1 million for an effective tax rate of 21.1%. This compares to GAAP income taxes in Q3 2018 of $20.1 million for an effective tax rate of 20.8%. The relatively consistent effective tax rate versus prior year reflected the lower federal statutory tax rate related to U.S. tax reform and both years also included certain discrete tax deductions as a result of tax planning to help lower our overall tax obligations. Diluted net income per share for the Company on a GAAP basis was $1.18 in the third quarter of 2019 compared to a $1.11 in the prior year. The specific calculations for these earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release. The current year quarter earnings per share calculation of $1.18 includes the impact of a $1.5 million adjustment to increase the value of the redeemable non-controlling interest for the Pramac acquisition, resulting in a $0.02 reduction in GAAP earnings per share. The prior-year quarter earnings per share calculation of $1.11 includes a similar adjustment of $6.9 million resulting in $0.11 reduction in GAAP earnings per share. Adjusted net income for the Company, as defined in our earnings release, was $90 million in the current year quarter or $1.43 per share versus $89.1 million in the prior year or a $1.43 per share. With regards to cash income taxes, the third quarter of 2019 included the impact of a cash income tax expense of $15.1 million as compared to $15.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The current year reflects an expected cash income tax rate of 17% for the full-year 2019, while the prior-year third quarter was based on an expected cash tax rate of 15% for the full-year 2018. This increase in cash tax rate is due to a higher level of expected pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. Recall that every dollar of pre-tax earnings over and beyond our $30 million tax shield is now taxed at the expected GAAP tax rate of approximately 25%. Cash flow from operations was $111.2 million as compared to $59.3 million in the prior year third quarter, and free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was $100.8 million as compared to $47 million in the same quarter last year. As we discussed last quarter, we expected to monetize a significant portion of our primary working capital in the second half of 2019 in line with normal seasonality. To that end, primary working capital was a $28 million higher source of cash flow in the current year third quarter versus prior year. In addition, the prior year included a $9 million pension contribution and $7 million of additional interest as we changed the timing of our term loan interest payments, both of which did not repeat in the current year. Taking a look at our balance sheet, on January 1, 2019, we adopted the new GAAP lease accounting standard. This new standard requires that we recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to operating leases on our balance sheet. As a result, we recognized approximately $40 million of additional other assets and other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet in Q1 to adopt the new standard. As of September 30, 2019, we had a total of $954 million of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.1 times on an as reported basis. Additionally, at the end of the third quarter, we had $216 million of cash on hand and there was approximately $271 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. Both our term loan and ABL facilities mature in the year 2023. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our updated outlook for 2019.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. As we have discussed end market conditions for our residential products remains strong and better than expected, as a result of recent elevated power outage activity. Conversely, our C&I mobile products and International businesses have softened in recent months, partially offsetting the gains we're seeing with our residential products. However, based on the strength of residential products, we're raising our guidance for revenue growth for full-year 2019. As we now expect overall net sales to improve approximately 8% to 9% versus prior year, which compares to the previous guidance of 6% to 7% growth. On a core basis, full-year 2019 net sales growth is now expected to be approximately 7%, which compares to the previous guidance of 4% to 5%. These growth rates assume normal baseline power outage activity for the remainder of the year. As a result of a more favorable sales mix and improved operating leverage compared to previous guidance, we are also raising our margin expectations for the full-year 2019. Net income margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are now expected to be approximately 11.5% versus 11% previous guidance. The corresponding adjusted EBITDA margins are now expected to be approximately 20.5% for the year, as compared to the previous guidance of 20%. Operating and free cash flow generation for the full-year 2019 is expected to remain strong with the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow anticipated to be approximately 80%, as we work to further monetize our working capital in the fourth quarter. The remaining guidance items provided in previous earnings calls are not expected to change. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you, sir. At this time, we would like to take any questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tom Hayes of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Tom Hayes: Good morning, guys.
York Ragen: Good morning, Tom.
Tom Hayes: I was just wondering, as you build out your California network with the growth in activity out there, are you guys currently able to kind of keep up with the demand for the in-home consultations and maybe are you kind of facing any backlog in that right now?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So it's a great question, Tom. So obviously things are incredibly busy out in California. IHC -- our IHC numbers are kind of off the charts now off of its fairly small base from last year, but up 500%, 600% over the prior year. So we're seeing -- and that's a tremendous leading indicator for us and we look at that and we look at our close rates and that translates really well to strong demand in the -- over the next several quarters. This is not going to be a one quarter event, this is going to be -- we think a long tail event, similar to other kind of major events that we would see, generally you see a tail that is in some cases multi-year as opposed to even multi-quarter. So that's kind of how things are shaping up. To answer the question on whether we're able to keep up, the actual answer is no, we are inundated right now, we're adding distribution, we're actually doing some pretty unique things around sharing those leads with other channel partners outside of our traditional dealer channel simply because our dealer counts, which are growing in the state, we're now at about 300 dealers in the State of California, we started the year at about 100, so we've added a fair number of dealers in California in a very short period of time. But yet, just on-boarding those dealers and developing them it takes time. And so we had to take those leads and we're doing other things with those leads so that obviously we don't want people to have to wait to talk to somebody about these products. So there is a backlog in some cases, depending on which region you're in, which zip-code, actually it's down to the zip-code level that you're in, it could be a backlog of a couple of weeks. We hope it doesn't get longer than that. We know that we need to stay focused on turning around IHCs very quickly and maintain the quality of the IHCs as well, that's also incredibly important. So that goes hand-in-hand with our success rate in closing those deals. So it's a challenge right now, but it's not unlike what we see in other parts of the U.S. when we get outages, but California is particularly -- things are particularly acute because we're relatively underdeveloped there.
Tom Hayes: I appreciate the color. Maybe if I could just ask one more related to California. I think you called out you expect about $50 million in contribution in this year and maybe growing to almost $200 million in the near future. Is that primarily the residential applications because I know if you're looking at the news and everything, you're also saying that light commercial grocery stores, [indiscernible] out, maybe talk about kind of how you're focusing on that commercial application opportunity as well?
Aaron Jagdfeld: We are -- Tom, the $200 million would be representative of both residential and commercial backup power. It does not include the clean energy opportunities that we've spoken to. So I think that's important is that -- that will largely be a California story as well. So, California is a state for us. In totality, in the next few years, we anticipate it's going to be a really important market for us. But back to your question, the $200 million -- obviously the penetration rates for backup power are relatively low, both on the residential side and C&I side in the state. But the larger opportunity is still going to be residential for us, we just, we feel that -- C&I will be very interesting as well, but I think a good chunk of that $200 million we anticipate is going to come through the residential channel, which obviously from a margin perspective is going to be mixed positive. On the C&I side. I think we may actually see next year or this is kind of my premonition based on our experience and seeing this in the past. I think the telecom companies are going to be evaluating their networks in California in a much deeper way. I think they're going to provide a lot of scrutiny on just how much backup power they have. We know that again penetration rates even in California for telecom gensets are less than 30%. So that means that two-thirds, more than two-thirds of all the sites -- these wireless sites in California do not have long range backup power. And so that's a problem. And if this is going to be the kind of situation in terms of the shut-off it's going to extend years as people have said it well -- it's going to be absolutely critical those wireless networks are backed up. You can imagine, just the combination of having the power out and then the threat of these fires to be completely cut off from a communication standpoint is really an untenable position to be in. And so I think the communication companies -- the telecommunication companies are going to focus very heavily on that. And that could being the number one provider to those markets, that could be an upside potential for us next year. We're going to put together our guidance for 2020 and we'll bring that out with more clarity here in the quarter ahead. But my premonition would be that there is some decent some decent potential at least around that vertical within the State of California.
Tom Hayes: Thanks, I appreciate the color. I'll get back in the queue.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ross Gilardi: Hey, good morning guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Ross.
Ross Gilardi: Yes. I just wanted to make sure I understood your guidance because you're sticking with this base case scenario of no material outages, but you've just had four fairly material outages in California. So are you -- I don't know if you would characterize them all as major. So are you including the revenue benefit from what's happened in the last two weeks in the outlook or no?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So here's -- I think the way to think about [indiscernible] this, Ross, there's a couple of moving pieces here. One is on the residential side, portable generators. We had a really solid quarter in Q3 and actually port gens were flat in Q3 and we thought we were going to have a really tough comp, but with Dorian, that kind of stirred it up the coast, the Eastern seaboard, we were able to ship a lot of product -- that was -- we had a lot of visibility of that storm coming and everybody thought -- Florida was going to take a direct hit. So we put a lot of product into the State of Florida and kind of in the Carolinas. That never materialized, so the sell-through was poor. And so what we've got is, we've got an inventory -- field inventory kind of situation that has to be worked through. We think that will happen in the fourth quarter, but it's going to probably manifest in lower portable generator shipments in Q4. So kind of think of Q4, there was some pull ahead in the Q3 on port gens. Then you've got our industrial businesses, and our international businesses. Specifically in the industrial business is the mobile component that continues to slow down. That's been disappointing for us, it's beyond our expectations actually, it slowed down. And you've heard many of the large national rental accounts come out and say just they are cutting back on CapEx spending. We see it kind of as a momentary pause in their buying cycles, but it's a pause nonetheless. And it's probably a deeper pause than we had originally projected. So there is that component. And then internationally, we just continue to see things like Brexit, some of the things that are going on in Latin America, I mean you can look at just about every country in Latin America right now and there is some kind of geopolitical issue going on. You've got the tariff trade war type of stuff also impacting and creating uncertainty around the world. And so our international businesses have been feeling that. On the flip side of that, you have home standby. And now there is some port gens that will go out to California. But one of the limitations with port gens in California is that they have to be CARB-certified. So that puts a bit of a cap on what we can ship into the state. California historically hasn't been a big market for backup power. So at the beginning of this year when we make our portable gen kind of pre-buys for the year and our production forecast, those were lighter for our CARB-certified portable gens. So we're actually in communication with CARB and with EPA on whether or not we can get a waiver to supply additional portable generators that are non-CARB certified into California because we've got a lot of those products and we could help a lot of people in California if we could get a waiver approved -- a temporary waiver. We haven't heard back on that yet we're negotiating that. If that happens, there could be some potential upside to that. And then on home standby, that as I said, it's just going to take time to develop. I think we had originally sized the prize in California probably $25 million of upside if shut-offs happened. We're doubling that to $50 million. Most of that's going to happen in the fourth quarter. So I think we've appropriately sized this and we're including it in our guidance. There are some potential upsides there and there are some offsetting pieces with international and industrial. I think that's kind of the way to think about the guide.
Ross Gilardi: Okay. So it sounds like the home standby business, you had two scenarios last quarter, sounds like the home standby business went to the upper end if not above the high end of the previous assumption, but it's offset by the mobile products business, international and the field inventory situation and portable. Is that a fair way to think about it?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, that's exactly it Ross.
Ross Gilardi: Okay. And then could you comment on your solar storage products coming in double your initial projections. In your 3-year outlook, you had suggested that these products would add 200 basis points annually of growth for the next 3 years. I mean I know that was a little bit back-end loaded. But based on that comment, can we assume that you at least do actually get to 200 basis points next year? Or are you actually saying you're going to add 400 basis points of growth next year from Pika and Neurio etc?
Aaron Jagdfeld: No, I think what we're saying is we get to that long-term kind of target quicker and which means we will get more of that next year. I don't -- I wouldn't double the 200 basis points to 400 basis points, but that 150-basis point to 200-basis point improvement, that could happen quicker. And I mean-I went to the SPI show in Salt Lake City and I'll be -- perfect honestly here on the record, I'm not a fan of trade shows, I just never have been, but it was an amazing reception to our entry into this market. I think it caught us -- I don't want to say it caught by surprise, but we were generally pleased with the receptivity to our entrance here. And this is not going to be a demand side problem. That much I think -- most times when you enter a new market, I think going after demand is always kind of one of your concerns, your chief concerns. My chief concern here supply chain constraints. It's going to be around battery, it's going to be around power electronic components, it's going to be around our ability to produce. We're going to have to on-board distribution of course to do installations. We have a lot of work to do to make this happen, but we're basically taking -- as we think about the acquisition targets when we put those together, we put a model together for what we thought the acquisitions could do for us in year one, year two, year three and out, we're basically -- essentially doubling what we had on the page for year two, more than doubling to be honest, and I'm -- if we could probably if we could get more capacity if somehow we can come through on that, maybe there's even further upside. I think we're limiting that because we're just -- the capacity thing is kind of a wildcard here, right? I think we fairly sized it with what our comments represent today, but this is going to be a supply side constraint more than it will be a demand side constraint, at least in the early innings here.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of very Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Hi, good morning everyone.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Jerry.
York Ragen: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could talk about how your in-home consultations have been tracking outside of California and it looks like your dealer count grew by a 100 outside of California as well in the quarter, if I triangulated the numbers right. Are you seeing that dynamic that you've seen during prior major power outage events where you get a nationwide halos. Is that playing out?
Aaron Jagdfeld: It is two-degree, I mean I would say this Jerry, whether I say it's a halo because of what's going on in California or I think it's more -- we keep looking at this -- this home standby category is -- it's amazing. I have to tell you the resiliency of this category, the potential upside here in terms of just overall penetration opportunity, IHCs have been very strong this year. They were strong, obviously the Dorian situation drove a lot of interest in the category for a period of time, that didn't materialize in terms of outages, but it did materialize for us in terms of home standby interest. It got people thinking about outages again. Certainly, the California outages from a national perspective -- I think California is a little unique when it comes to national coverage. I don't know why that is, I think it's just is a little bit like that. What happens in California is a little bit more bubble than it is maybe in other -- than things that happen in other regions. I can't explain that, but it just is. So maybe there is a little bit of tempering of that in terms of a halo effect, but I would say overall, IHCs have been just amazingly strong this year. And the home standby business is just -- it's a great business and there is so much runway left in that that every time I look at that business, I mean for us -- I think it's really important to point this out, we're at the point now with that product line in terms of capacity, production, we're looking at alternate sites where we can build that product, building out other supply chains, it's become so big that we need to expand our kind of thinking around how big it can be in totality. I think the home standby generator category is something that is going to become the kind of part of your homes infrastructure like central HVAC has become, I think it's going to, especially as homes become more connected. One of the things that's a really interesting observation out in California in particular is as people buy home standby generators, we're seeing a much higher connectivity rate with our Mobile Link. So this is our monitoring system, our WiFi-enabled monitoring system, we're seeing a 4x to 5x number of connectivities in terms of percentage of connected generators over the kind of national average which tells me just California is always ahead of the curve on kind of IoT and connected homes and things like that, but I think it's just a sign of where things are going to go and we're just -- we're really bullish on home standby.
Jerry Revich: The last time you folks were supply constraint in home standby, there was a material carryover effect into the seasonally weak first quarter. Is that playing out now? I'm just trying to put that into context with your comments about inventories coming down, that was probably a portables comment, but can you just comment on those two items please?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Jerry, so right now, our home standby production levels are relatively high. They can go higher. In fact, we've made some provisions here to take them higher here throughout the fourth quarter, and we're going to keep them higher going into the first quarter. Couple of reasons for that. One, obviously, we're watching very closely how quickly home standby demand can develop. Again it's -- a home standby generator project is a home improvement project, it just takes time. I can't underestimate under kind of -- put those in words just how -- how long it does take to do a project. It's just months in the making. You have to -- you start out, you find a dealer, you go through the process of getting a proposal, you have to make arrangements from a project standpoint for other subcontractors with gas and electric and there's landscaping involved, there is permitting involved. It's a process. And like any home improvement process, it generally always takes longer than you think it should. So that will develop over time. And so one of the unique things about California, we see this when we get hurricanes down south and things like that is you can install generators year around in California. This is something you can't do it in the Northeast or in the Midwest. So typically we get seasonal slowdowns in Q1 because of the slowdown in installation of home standbys in the Northeast and the Midwest. We think, because the California is a new element here, installation should remain fairly robust through the first quarter. So that's a cool new dynamic for us and I think it should have a positive impact. And we want to maintain really high levels or decent levels of flow in terms of production on home standby because if this does develop more quickly, Q1 could potentially represent a decent quarter because of that install type of capacity that can happen. We're not making a call on that. No, we're not talking about Q1 guidance, but at the same time, those are the realities of things that we've seen in the past and how we think this might develop.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And then given those moving pieces, it does sound like you're embedding a significant production cut in C&I in the fourth quarter. Can you just expand on your production outlook by line of business within C&I please?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, so on the -- actually on the C&I stationary side what's interesting is, we've been in a deeper backlog there than we normally get into. Our lead times have been extended, demand has been high, particularly around telecom and in the back half year of the year what we hit is we kind of hit a telecom air pocket, in terms of installs. You've got some unique things going on out there in the marketplace with a couple of our Tier 1 wireless carriers, both T-Mobile with the Sprint acquisition and then you've got AT&T doing some things around capital optimization and some things there that have been in the news recently. And that slowed down some of the CapEx spending on networks here in the back half of the year. Again, we think that's kind of a momentary pause, some of it is T-Mobile just absorbing quite a bit of purchasing earlier in the year, but that -- where we're slowing production if we're slowing it at all is in those areas, but frankly our C&I factories are very busy and will remain so. They were just incredibly busy for the first half of the year and now they're just going to be somewhat busy in the back half of the year. I would say, mobile products is a little bit different that continues to slow down. And I would say our factories that produce mobile products were probably going to see those kind of slowdown, especially as we exit the lighting tower season, which is kind of Q3 and into early Q4. We generally see lighting tower business is somewhat seasonal that way and so as that slows down, we'll probably see our mobile products factories slow a bit.
Jerry Revich: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning. Hey, I had a couple of questions on the acquisition. So curious on the relative emphasis on the Pika ESS solution versus combined solution with the Neurio home energy management systems. And secondly, the view around the installed cost to the customer and where that is in the process, how that trends to more affordable over time?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, so just so I'm clear Chris to your question -- your first part of your question on the combination of Pika and Neurio, you're curious as to how that's going or how it's progressing or was that --
Christopher Glynn: Just where's the first couple of years run rate more pronounced on the combined BEM HEMS or more on the BEMS Pika stand-alone solution.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Got it. So good question. And there are some different views even internally here on that, but I'll give you, since I'm the CEO, I can do this. I'll give you my view. And I think what's going to happen is the combined solution was really well received at SPI. This idea of an intelligent storage solution and really being the first one on the market that it's going to have kind of end-to-end energy management, energy monitoring and storage in a single package by a single supplier. This is the other thing, most of the packages on the market today if they have any bit of intelligence to them, they're generally cobbled together pieces from other suppliers. We're going to provide the end-to-end solution here at Generac, all the way through. Now it's a combination, admittedly of the Pika Technologies and of the Neurio Technologies and actually some of the Generac Technologies, but it will come together, be supported and it will come together under one brand of the Generac brand.That was really well received at the show. Now I personally think the HEMS-only solution, which we're actually going to start shipping in the fourth quarter, our HEMS-only solution with bundled with our transfer switches for backup power for home standby, so in the future starting here in the fourth quarter, roughly December time frame, you can buy a home standby generator that could have a transfer switch option, which includes the Neurio technology, which is pretty cool. Today, you can install it as a separate stand-alone device, but it will be embedded technology. We're actually looking at that as potentially being a standard feature down the line, we have to get the cost structure right to do that, but we really think that that's a potential differentiator -- we've got a lot of differentiation in that product line already, that's why we have 75% market share, but that could be an additional potential differentiator for us going forward. I like the HEMS-only solution, which is what I'm kind of referring to that as. But I do think that there is no denying that -- just incredible receptivity we had to the combined intelligent storage solution. And then on your question about install costs, we're very focused on this and I think this is an area that where our experience with home standby generators can be very helpful. We've known for a long time that affordability is an incredibly important component of adoption rate, the speed of adoption, the penetration rate. And so a massive part of affordability of course, and when you look at home standby, half of the cost of the home standby is the actual generator itself and the other half is installation. Now it's not quite to that degree with the storage solution, but it is -- installation is still a meaningful component. What we really liked about the Pika solution and this is one of the reasons why we chose Pika over others in terms of acquisition, is that they use and approach the installation, which was much more cost effective than what others are doing. They can do a single installer, a single person can do an install of a Pika solution, because the actual battery modules are modular. So there is no single component in the Pika solution that weighs more than 70 pounds. So you can actually affect that installation with a single individual which dramatically lowers cost. If you look at some of the other solutions on the marketplace, you need two or even three people to lift these things or special gear to lift these things up and mount them on walls or other areas. So that's a part of the -- that was a part of the draw for us with Pika, but going forward, there are other things that we can do in the interconnections to the homes electrical system that we think we can improve even further the installation cost. It's going to be a major focus area. That being said, there is obviously a massive focus -- there's probably a bigger upside on the cost structure of the product itself from the batteries to the inverters, power electronics all the other components and subcomponentry, we think -- as we've said before, we have a great roadmap in front of us and we're executing against that roadmap and we will throughout 2020 to take cost out of that solution.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks for the color.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Joe Aiken of William Blair. Your line is open.
Joe Aiken: Hi. I'm on for Brian Drab today. Good morning guys.
York Ragen: Good morning Joe.
Joe Aiken: I just wanted to circle back on California for a second. Has your work in terms of the longer term revenue potential there, has that changed at all since the Analyst Day?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So I would say that -- we laid out at the Analyst Day was home standby only is what we kind of talked to, we talked to $100 million potential in home standby by I think we said 2022, if memory serves me correct. I would say -- at that point in time when we put that together, I don't think we saw perhaps the shut-offs being as large in scale or as numerous in frequency as maybe they've turned out to be here.
York Ragen: They hadn't started yet.
Aaron Jagdfeld: They hadn't started yet, so I don't think we have a frame of reference other than what. We knew that when there are red flag days that would be the likely trigger and we looked at historical red flag days but we weren't sure that PG&E would do this and I think also tempering our enthusiasm and maybe even still so just how long will this go on? I mean, the CEO of PG&E came out and said it could be as much as 10 years. A decade of darkness for the people in California. I mean -- that really kind of -- after we heard that, we really started to think about this may be a little bit differently. And I can tell you, internally we've really -- we're burning a lot of calories right now across the business and it's interesting, it's not just in the residential side of the business, which is what we've been talking about, it's as we mentioned on this call the C&I opportunity with telecom. There is a mobile opportunity for mobile generators and lighting towers, right, when the lights go out, it's dark. So there's lighting tower opportunity. There's water pump opportunity. Sometimes utilities fail -- water utilities fail. We don't have power. So there is our mobile business has some opportunities. We've got our chores business, oddly enough, our chores business, they manufacture -- one of their number one product lines is brush cutting equipment. There is a lot of brush in California that needs to be cleared to be successful. So we're actually seeing an uptick in brush cutting equipment, in stump grinding equipment, some of the forestry management equipment that we manufacture for that business, which is really interesting. And then you've got the clean energy side of that. And I think that's probably the side and again, I wish I could tell you we were this smart when we did our acquisitions earlier this year and we kind of looked at the battery -- the storage market and the energy management and monitoring markets to know that this was going to happen. We did not have this on our kind of in our math or in our model. So to answer your question directly, yes, I think we have a lot more optimism regarding the importance of California to the business going forward than what we were probably talking about during the Investor Day.
Joe Aiken: Okay. That's really helpful color. Thanks. And then just switching gears a little bit more of a quick modeling question, are you able to provide any guidance in terms of expectations for gross margin, EBITDA just directionally in 2020 versus 2019?
York Ragen: 2020, we're not giving any 2020 guidance I guess if that's your question.
Aaron Jagdfeld: No, I mean, Joe, we're going to -- our normal process for that would be, we'll finish out the year here and we were obviously in the middle of that, we're working on that, where like any company, we've got an AOP process and we're kind of grinding through that and obviously what's pretty unique in our business, and this is always the case, and maybe thanks for a different year-end or different cycle or something. But we always have in the fall we have -- this is a seasonal business, so -- and you kind of don't know what you're going to get in terms of seasonal demand, right? So it could be hurricane season if you have a strong hurricane season or if it's early winter season with Nor'easters or in this case, the wildfire season, which has played out for us in terms of the blackouts out in California. Those always add a new dimension in terms of trying to calibrate what do you think you're going to do next year. And as those seasons develop, we're right always in the middle of our AOP, we end up redoing our AOP, I don't know how many times York. It becomes an incredibly iterative process which is -- it's just, it's not very efficient, but it is the nature of the beast. And so we're in the middle of that and we're recalibrating again based on my comments here just a second ago to you regarding how we're thinking about California, in particular, but we'll put all that together and then it's something that we'll do in Q1, we do that call for the Q4 call, we'll give our 2020 guidance there in more detail.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Jeff.
York Ragen: Hey, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond: Just on the margins. I mean, the mix was better on home standby than like the lower margin commercial and portables, yet there wasn't a lot of leverage. Just want to understand like investment costs and how that impacted the margins in the quarter? And how to think about that going forward?
York Ragen: Yes, I think we are -- I mean, if you're talking, gross margins, we did see that mix improvement, which drove gross margins higher. I think -- we were pleased actually that we saw that increased gross margins in light of the tariff environment. I know we've done a lot of work with pricing actions and our profitability enhancement programs collectively around the company to mitigate the impact of tariffs. So, and I think we were able to successfully do that. And then on top of that, we were able to, with the higher mix, drive gross margins higher. I think collectively, the price cost overhead -- improved overhead absorption is embedded in there.
Jeff Hammond: No leverage -- not having the leverage, I think just --
Aaron Jagdfeld: Are we talking gross margin or OpEx --
Jeff Hammond: No, Op margins, yes -- Op margins.
York Ragen: Operating margins, yes, so that's the gross margin side, then on the OpEx side, you're right -- if you just look at our fixed OpEx costs, there was obviously a nice leverage on our fixed operating costs.
Aaron Jagdfeld: From a variable standpoint, we made some pretty big investments, one, you've got the clean energy OpEx run in through there now, right? And so those are -- we said that were those start-ups, right? Those are money-losing businesses at least initially here. We hope to get to break-even even quicker based on our optimism for that business going forward, but we made some pretty big investments around clean. We've got some big investments continuing to go on around connectivity. That's a big place that we've made investments, lead gas -- we -- our lead gas initiatives are -- there is a lot of missionary work that's going into that to build that out, those our global initiatives too, because obviously we got to do a lot of work there. So we felt that the right thing to do for the long term for this business is to make those investments. I think the easy thing to do would have been to put that in our pocket and not invest. I'm a big believer in continuing to invest not only in the R&D side of the business, but really in the market growth areas. We're also spending pretty heavily in California. So as you can imagine to build that market we're running infomercials now, we're running a lot of digital advertising out there, we've got a lot of awareness building to do and so that won't necessarily materialize maybe as dramatically as the spend would indicate like if we spent that kind of money in terms of efficiency of spend in other parts of the country we'd probably get a bigger lift. But knowing what we know around just how it's going to take to develop, California, that's an investment in the future. So those things are really why you didn't see the leverage on EBITDA margins the way you might have expected. I think York's exactly right on the gross margin line. We're pretty happy with that. I mean we've been fighting off the tariff stuff all year long, and I think we're pretty happy that we're able to do that, and we've had some pretty good leverage in the factories, just being able to run things as utilization rates as high as they've been, but on the OpEx side, we've been making some pretty big investments for next year. For that whole step function change as a company, we got to go and fill in on the OpEx side that next level of -- to get that next level of growth, we got to fill in the infrastructure to be able to achieve that.
Jeff Hammond: Okay, that's helpful. Just -- If you can -- I know you don't want to give 2020 guidance. But if you can just level set us on how to think about clean energy growth from a baseline level in 2020. Just, I mean it sounds like you're feeling you got very good reception, but you got supply constraints. I'm just trying to think how to model that.
York Ragen: Yes, I think the prepared remark was well in excess of 100 megawatt hours of storage, that we would deploy next year and that is more than double what our original kind of plan on a page was for year two of these businesses. And so, I mean calibrate around that -- I'm going to stop short of probably giving you an exact sales number, because there are some moving pieces in that. We talked a little bit on this call about the individual HEMS devices. So you've got that, that's not really in the 100 megawatt hours obviously, 100 megawatt hours is really storage. But everything else kind of goes along that. We've got what we refer to as [PV] links which are the modules that go on the rooftop, that go hand in hand with the solar systems that are components of the overall solar plus storage. So there's other components outside of just the storage systems themselves. But I would say this, Jeff, the overall point is that if you go back to our Investor Day and you kind of look at where we were calibrating kind of out to 2022, there is a really good chance. So we're going to get there are a lot quicker, that's really the comment today. How far we can go next year? I think again I'm tempering that by talking about supply chain, there could be some upside in that even further if supply chain can go further. This is not a demand side problem year one or year two, there is a lot of demand. And California is going to drive the demand even higher. I think that's the piece, maybe the change even from the Investor Day is just the level of interest around storage. What you've got is a situation where you got a lot of solar rooftops, people who have solar on their homes out in California that thought they were covered in a blackout, and what they're finding out is those systems were structured such, they're engineered such that the power is fed back to the grid. It's a basically a one-way trip. So when the grid is down, the system is down. So there is no backup. And so the lights are out. And so what they need to do is they need to add storage to their existing solar systems. Only 2% of the 2 million solar systems that are out there in the U.S. have storage, 98% do not. That's a very wide market for us to go after in terms of adding storage to an existing solar system. And that's going to be a target market for us as we go forward. And I think out in California, that's going to be a very right market as people look to add some resiliency to their existing system. And I think they now have a much greater awareness that those systems have a lot more severe limitations than maybe they were aware of.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Chip Moore of Canaccord. Your line is open.
Chip Moore: Yes, good morning. Thanks. Hey, guys. Wondering if you could go back to the [$50] million in California, just given some of the emissions regulations. Can you talk about how much of that is portables versus standby? And then as we look forward, anything to consider on the regulatory side on the automatic standby?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, I think -- from a mix standpoint, the majority is standby because we can't get as many portables, excuse me -- into that market. Again, it's really kind of -- it's conundrum because we have a lot of portable product because we're planned for season, Dorian did take a fair amount of product that we still had product leftover we're prepared for the winter season as you would see normally in the Midwest and the Northeast but those products are what we refer to in our business as 49 state product, so they're EPA compliant, but the California Resource Board has a higher level of standard for tail pipe emissions and so we have a special SKU for California. We call it a CARB SKU, we don't plan year in and year out, California traditionally has not been a huge portable generator market. So when we did our planning cycle this year, we just didn't plan for a lot of CARB units. Now we've tried to add more, but we have long supply chain there and we're bringing more in toward the end of the year, but we have a lot of product we could put in California today and we have retailers that are begging for but we can't ship it there legally. So we're working with California and the regulators to see if we can get a temporary waiver to help people. I think this is a really critical thing. These are incredibly limited use products over their entire lifetime. So in terms of overall tail pipe emissions, they're never going to approach what you might see in a different kind of engine powered piece of equipment. So I think probably the regulation shouldn't even deal with these types of products, but they do, that's just the nature of the beast and we have to comply with all the regulations. Going forward, if we can -- we're obviously going to take a bigger bet on CARB-related portables going forward, we'll plan differently for next season. And we'll have more of those products. So the mix is probably going to be, I don't want to say it's more evenly balanced, but it's certainly going to have more portable gen mix toward in years ahead if we have the same situation develop. So I think that today it's going to be very heavily skewed toward home standby, which is -- by the way very margin positive in terms of just overall mix.
Chip Moore: Right, that's helpful. And anything to consider on this standby side in terms of CARB-related products?
Aaron Jagdfeld: All of our home standbys are what we refer to as 50-state compliant products. So it's the same product everywhere in the U.S. So, no constraints on home standby at all.
Chip Moore: Perfect. And then just one more on the clean energy side looking to potentially double that original plan of 100 megawatts, can you talk about some of the key components and as you mentioned the supply chain constraints, just your confidence that you have those and any price pressures.
Aaron Jagdfeld: So I think -- my confidence would be sized appropriately for my comments today, it's double the original plan we had. But if we were to satisfy all the demand that is potential there for next year, it could be higher. And I think we've appropriately sized the constraints and the constraints are everywhere, Chip, I mean they're on batteries, they're on the power electronic components going to the inverters, there is some capacity constraints on even assembling the systems themselves. We're looking at -- our factories here today we have -- Pika had third parties doing that.They're not a manufacturer. So they had third parties doing that. We're going to likely bring by the end of next year, we'll be going to bring that in-house to do more of that if we can, or at least help maybe as a second source to the existing sources, so that we can increase capacity, but it's basically -- it's a capacity constraint along basically all the components. And then in terms of cost pressures, we're having some good success early on here taking costs out of the system. We think we are on our original trajectory. So I won't tell you that that trajectory has quickened, I wouldn't -- the demand has quickened the trajectory of cost out. So we have -- it's going to happen over the course of next year. So the margins starting out are going to be on the lower side as we had projected and will grow to be kind of -- think of kind of our overall corporate margins by the time we hit the end of next year. That's kind of our target. And so today, they are less than that. And by the end of next year, we hope to be kind of in that kind of overall corporate margin range.
Chip Moore: Great, thanks a lot.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Philip Shen of ROTH Capital. Your line is open.
Philip Shen: Hey guys, thanks for the questions. You talked a lot about constraints on the supply side. Can you address the constraints you may be seeing if any on the installation side and how that might play out? I think labor for solar and storage installations, certainly solar is quite tight and in California, others in the industry have talked about that. So as you guys are generating these leads through your infomercials, what kind of bottleneck or lag are you seeing potentially with your contractors and how do you expect to address that over time if that is a problem?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, it's a great question, Phil, and it is part of -- we've been focused on the supply chain side constraints. But there is that -- the same issue we run into with home standby frankly. So we're actually, we're pretty experienced at how to help on-board installation bandwidth. It's a problem we face anytime we get a major surge in demand for our home standby products, we have similar constraints. So the way we deal with that and the way we're dealing with this in particular around clean energy, a couple of things I'll talk in general to how we deal with it at home standby and how that applies to clean energy and then maybe something that's a little more specific to clean energy. So on -- what we would normally do as we on-board dealers. We have almost 6,200, 6,300 dealers nationwide here today, and those are mostly electrical contractors. Now we only have a 100, we started the year with 100 in California, we're up to 300, but we're adding dealers very quickly out in California. We spend a ton of time training them on installs and training them on efficiency of install. We're very focused, we want them to take a pit crew mentality on installs because we know that if they can double the number of installs that they can do, that has a material impact on insulation bandwidth without having to add a ton of additional installers. That being said, installation bandwidth is going to be in short supply for the near-term future. So there will be constraints across the board as we add dealers, but I think the unique thing about Generac and what we bring to this clean energy space is the fact that we can bring these dealers on and they can be representing us across a wide range of categories and we're very good at engaging with electrical contractors on home standby, we're going to be equally as good as engaging with them on clean energy. So we might have -- today, as an example, we can have a dealer who is very interested in home standby and maybe they're out in California and they join the team, they become a dealer today, and we tell them about our clean energy product. They say, yes, that's interesting, but I'm up here in Northern Cal and everybody is really talking home standby. That's what I'm focused on. As that demand relaxes and it will over time, the ability for that dealer to shift into a clean energy type of installation bandwidth mode and away from home standby is I think real, that will happen. The other thing that's real, and this is maybe unique to the CE business or the clean energy business for us is that we're going to partner with some of the national solar companies, because they do have installed crews, many of them have their own install crews or they use third parties. So we're in negotiations and discussions with a number of those national companies today and we believe that very soon, we will be announcing several partnerships there, that will I think help us get that installation bandwidth to an even higher level. So I think it's going to be a constraint in the short term, but I think longer term, I think we're going to be in a great position to be able to resolve that constraint and may be in the best position in the industry to resolve that constraint longer term.
Philip Shen: Great. Aaron, that's great color. Thank you. One quick follow-up. As it relates to -- you're talking about potentially some of your existing contractor switching over to clean energy -- in solar, certainly have to get on a roof to do the install, to what degree do you think your contractor base has that skill set -- how realistic is it for them to be comfortable working on a roof and developing that the safety and other training programs to actually be able to switch over to -- be able to do solar and storage? Or do you think those contractors would just focus on the clean energy kind of battery side of the skill set and less so on solar?
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's another good question, Phil. And so -- as we kind of pulled our existing distribution, right, so these are again these 6,200 electrical contractors, there is a percentage of them that are comfortable with the additional duties that are required to install panels and some of them do actually today already, some of them have panel installation businesses and solar components in their business. It is a smaller percentage. I'll admit that. And there are others who have said, hey, with the storage component and the other power electronics components, they are very interested in that, because that's obviously, I'll call it high spec labor right for them and you need an electrician making many of those connections, when you talk about connecting the actual inverter, connecting the circuits, connecting -- making all the interconnects to the solar system itself. They may choose to focus on that side and higher out-labor or add labor that can take care of some of what needs to happen on the rooftops. There are some guys that are getting creative with that in terms of creating partnerships with roofing companies that they believe that have already some of those skill sets and the safety orientation that's necessary to affect that kind of work up on a rooftop. I think it's going to develop and I think you're right that that could end up manifesting itself to be a new dynamic for our existing distribution that we'll have to help them solve for, and it's something we're learning too, we're going through a lot of learning cycles in this business in a very short period of time and learning about the requirements of being on the rooftop, how those panels go down, what the safety requirements are which is absolutely paramount obviously for everybody. All of those things are new to us, but we're quick studies. One thing you'll know as you kind of follow us a bit, Phil and others, we pick things up quickly, we adapt very quickly, we move with agility, we react to things with a sense of urgency here. This will be no different. Where we see opportunity or challenges, we go after it. And as this develops, I expect that we'll see both of those things, challenges and opportunities and. And I think we're going to be in a really good position. I know our team's ability to execute. I think one of the hallmarks of this company is execution and I think one of the things as we've watched the clean energy space develop, one of the challenges that market had is execution. So I like what we bring to that market in terms of our ability to execute and I'm pretty excited about that. And that's part of what was so well received, I think with our entry into this market at SPI was, hey, here's an entrant somebody who has been there done that and has a track record of execution and it's not to say that we'll probably have our own challenges, but I like our chances when it comes to being able to get things done.
Philip Shen: Great, thanks again. I'll pass it on.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Phil.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further question. I would now like to turn the call back over to Aaron Jagdfeld for closing remarks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And we want to thank everybody for joining us this Halloween Morning. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter earnings results with you at some point in mid-February of 2020. Thanks again this morning and goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect, have great day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 Generac Holdings Inc Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead sir.
York Ragen: Thank you very much. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer. We'll begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter results represent a continuation to the strong start we experienced this year in the first quarter and are the best second quarter numbers we've ever had as a company. Strong domestic sales growth of 11% was driven by our residential and industrial stationary power generation markets during the quarter. Overall, net sales increased approximately 9% compared to the prior year when including contributions from our acquisitions which was slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts during the quarter. EBITDA margins exceeded our internal expectations and were slightly higher year-over-year at 20.6% as a combination of improved product mix, pricing and operating leverage on the higher sales volumes help to more than offset the impact of rising input costs and strategic investments that we believe will provide future growth. EBITDA dollars on a trailing 12 month basis reached an all-time high of nearly $450 million, demonstrating the continued earnings power of the company. Once again, strength in end market demand underpinned the increases in the quarter with interest in home standby generators in particular remaining very robust has increased power outage activity over the last several years together with our initiatives to grow the market resulted in continuing penetration gains. Shipments of stationary C&I products were also significantly higher year-over-year as demand for backup power increased primarily with our telecom customers, which helped to more than offset softer shipments of mobile products as a number of our larger rental customers deferred the timing of certain fleet purchases. Home standby generators continue to benefit from increasing category awareness and remained very strong during the quarter as shipments were approximately 20% higher than the prior year. Both activations and in-home consultations continue to be robust in the quarter and additionally our close rates have been trending higher for the last several years and hit an all time high in the second quarter. Dealer counts also rose to a record level of 6,100 as we continue to add and develop new dealers to increase the important sales, installation and service bandwidth needed to continue to grow the category. We are also beginning to see the number of generators connected on our Mobile Link monitoring platform climb rapidly as it has now been a year since the launch of the industry’s only – first and only standby generator with WiFi connectability as a standard feature. The rich stream of data we are seeing is providing valuable insights with regard to product usage, which allows us to refine our future product development plans. Further, the Mobile Link platform is serving to enhance the customer experience with all metrics clearly showing that the system is adding to the peace of mind that our end users seek in protecting their home or business with a standby generator. Additionally, we continue to build out our fleet platform, which allows our distribution partners to track their entire installed base of machines, leading to improved efficiency and troubleshooting and scheduling of routine maintenance for their customers. We believe that connectivity as a standard feature has been a game changer for our customers, our dealers and Generac and we look forward to greatly expanding this value proposition as we begin to combine the remote monitoring of the generator with our newly acquired energy monitoring capabilities. Over the last two decades, we've invested heavily and worked extremely hard to create the home standby generator market. As our efforts to develop distribution, create targeted marketing and deploy in-home selling processes have dramatically increased the overall awareness and growth of the category. These efforts have helped to build a market that is more than $1 billion annually today and which continues to grow quickly as penetration rates of single family unattached homes in the U.S. are still only at 4.5%. Our estimate is that each 1% of additional penetration represents $2 billion of market opportunity at retail prices. Power outages have steadily increased in frequency and duration over the course of the last 25 years, primarily due to the underinvestment in the electrical grid, which has left it more vulnerable to the increasingly unpredictable and more severe weather patterns that are being driven by a changing climate. In addition to the direct impacts from severe weather that caused power outages, the indirect effects of an increase in the conditions that cause wildfires is creating a much higher level of interest in backup power as utility companies have announced their intentions to shutdown huge portions of their service areas to prevent the catastrophic effects of their equipment, possibly causing a fire. In California where penetration rates of home standby generators stand at less than 1%, we have seen an incredible increase in the number of in-home consultations and other leading indicators that point to the rapid expansion of this market. To date, however, local utilities have done very little in the way of actual shutoffs as the peak season for wildfire conditions generally occurs in the fall timeframe, but we do expect there is a high likelihood that shutoffs will in fact be triggered and millions of customers could be left in the dark for days at a time. As a result, we are proactively working with local residences, municipalities, and several utility companies in the region to position product close to the areas likely to be impacted with specific focus on developing solutions for those most vulnerable to the effects of power outages. We are also working to drive awareness of the home standby category in this part of the country through our new infomercial, which launched several weeks ago, as well as deploying other forms of targeted marketing to promote the category. With historically low penetration rates in California, however, our efforts could be limited in the near-term as we worked to qualify, train and onboard new distribution partners across the state. As is the case with any major power outage event, we know that in addition to increasing distribution, we also need local regulators, inspectors and gas utilities to expand their bandwidth and sense of urgency around improving and providing the infrastructure necessary for this product category. This is typical of any market that is in a development phase and we have dealt with this situation before and we have an incredible team of people working to get the residents of California ready for the possibility of extended outages. In addition to our efforts in this part of the country will be extremely beneficial in helping us grow the market for energy storage, monitoring and home energy management. We took an enormous step forward to accelerate our entry into this nascent but fast growing market with our acquisitions of Pika Energy during the quarter and Neurio Technologies last quarter. The energy landscape is on the verge of dramatic changes in the decade ahead as a result of rising utility rates, grid stability issues, environmental concerns and the continuing performance and cost improvements and renewable energy and batteries. We believe onsite power from a number of potential sources including solar, wind, geothermal and natural gas power generation will supplement or possibly even replace the current centralized utility model over time. The need to manage, monitor and store the power that is generated in this distributed fashion has the potential to develop into an enormous market opportunity and is projected over the next several years to become a multibillion dollar opportunity annually. We believe our recent acquisitions will help us dramatically accelerate the growth of this market and position Generac as a key player as it develops. The combination of Pika's power electronics, battery management software and proprietary inverter technologies, alongside Neurio's hardware and software for energy monitoring and management, will allow us to bring an intelligent and efficient energy saving solution for this exciting new market. With Pika's proprietary hybrid inverter design and the industry's best round-trip battery efficiency, combined with Neurio's uniquely monitoring hardware and energy consumption algorithms, customers can optimally generate, store and consume their power, which we believe can create significant energy savings opportunities for homeowners and businesses. From the over two million homeowners in North America that already have solar installed and are looking to dramatically improve the payback of their system to the millions more that want to take control of their energy costs while also providing added relief from short-term power outages, this new solution will be a natural fit. Although very different than the backup power space we serve today, we believe that the market creation opportunity around energy storage will develop in a very similar fashion to what we've experienced with the home standby generator market over the past two decades. Our efforts to develop omnichannel distribution, targeted consumer-based marketing content and proprietary in-home sales tools continue to be important elements for creating the market for home standby generators, and we believe our experience and capabilities in these areas will be invaluable as we work to grow the energy management and storage market. Our sourcing and manufacturing competencies will also allow us to produce an affordable solution, which is critical to increasing penetration of this kind of product. The combination of awareness, availability and affordability have been key ingredients to growing the home standby generator market, and we believe they will play an equally important role in developing the market for energy storage. In the first 90 days under our ownership, we have been working to combine our Pika and Neurio organizations and have been developing the product roadmaps, processes and go-to-market tools that will be central to our clean energy efforts. We anticipate launching a full line of Generac-branded storage and energy management products in the fourth quarter of this year, which will be made available to our existing distribution partners, as well as a number of new partners that are already engaged in the renewable energy market. In addition to our focused efforts in the quarter to grow the residential side of our business, our commercial and industrial generator business also continues to have success as we experienced another strong quarter underpinned by a number of important macro drivers which continue to develop. Shipments of generators to telecom customers further accelerated in the second quarter as the major wireless carriers focused on building out and hardening their networks. With the impending deployment of 5G technology on the horizon, the need for continuous supply of power to their network sites has never been more critical. The increased data speeds and stability of 5G connectivity will provide for an important foundational layer that will enable some tremendously impactful future technologies. Ensuring that these networks are able to communicate without interruption even during power outages is essential for the new services and communications that will be dependent on 5G technology. Generac is a key supplier of backup power systems to every Tier 1 carrier in the U.S., which is a result of our ability to develop unique solutions and provide an unmatched level of support through our nationwide distribution network. Additionally, we believe we are in the unique position to benefit from the overall global telecom opportunity that exists. With the acquisition of Selmec in Mexico, we are now also the number one provider of backup power for the telecom market in Latin America. And our Pramac subsidiary has recently began to accelerate their targeted efforts in serving the market as well. We believe that similar to the position we have built in the Americas, we can become a global leader in telecom backup power as this key vertical begins another extended investment cycle in the years ahead. In addition to our focus on serving our telecom customers, we have also worked hard over the last several years to further promote the benefits of natural gas-powered generators as a substitute for the traditional diesel-powered systems that have historically been used in emergency backup applications. The strict regulation of diesel emissions have driven prices for generators that use these engines considerably higher over the past decade. When combined with the inherent drawback of diesel systems due to their refueling requirements as well as additional environmental concerns, an opportunity has developed for natural gas-powered generators as a cleaner and more economical alternative. Leveraging our decades of experience in natural gas power generation along with the expertise from our engineering teams at Motortech, which we acquired in 2017, we are executing on a comprehensive new product introduction road map aimed at bringing a number of larger natural gas power nodes to the market. We believe that natural gas has fundamentally far superior characteristics over diesel in power generation with its abundant supply, low prices, logistical advantages and environmental benefits, all contributing to growth rates for gas generators that are roughly double that of diesel sets in the emergency backup power market. Additionally, we continue to see an opportunity for our natural gas generators to be used in certain situations outside of the traditional standby power spaces as we begin to see a number of projects in the market around using these products for other grid support applications such as demand response programs, which are used to help utilities better balance the supply of power with consumption patterns. A natural gas generator that might otherwise be used only in an emergency could be deployed and managed by the customer, the utility or a third-party aggregator as a decentralized power generation asset. The concept of producing power on site locally and either consuming it or sending it back to the grid is not new. But the economics of using a natural gas generator for this purpose have become much more compelling in recent years as utility rates have continued to rise and natural gas prices have remained low. In response, we are focused on tailoring our product offering to better suit these applications, and we are in the process of adding the sales, engineering and project management resources necessary to effectively develop and participate in these new applications. Although the market for stationary C&I products has remained robust, shipments for our domestic mobile products were lower during the quarter mainly due to the timing of capital spending by certain of our national rental account customers as their fleet utilization rates remain below their internal targets. Softer energy prices and a more difficult financing environment have pressured the oil and gas segment in particular, leading to a reduction in rig counts in 2019, which we believe may be a significant contributor to the pullback in rental CapEx spending. Partially offsetting the lower shipments to national account customers, however, in the quarter, were increased equipment purchases from independent rental businesses who did not refleet as heavily in prior years. Our longer-term views on the need for increased levels of spending on infrastructure projects in the U.S. coupled with an expanding domestic energy industry remain intact, and we believe these macro themes will result in greater demand for mobile products in the years ahead. Outside of the traditional domestic markets, our international business was roughly flat year-over-year as the prior year second quarter included a number of larger projects that have not yet repeated to this point in 2019. When adjusting for the timing of these large projects, we saw solid core growth in several regions outside the U.S. including Brazil, China and parts of Central Europe. Although adjusted EBITDA margins for the International segment were lower year-over-year due to the timing of these large projects, they did increase sequentially from the first quarter, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to improve to continue to improve these margins to our targeted lower double-digit levels over time. Additionally, we continue to see the benefit of our international expansion strategy as interest in home standby and gas used generators for commercial and industrial applications continues to gain traction in many new markets around the world As natural gas infrastructure continues to expand and as these markets become more familiar with our gas product offering, we see the long-term substitution of traditional backup – diesel backup power occurring in similar fashion to what we've experienced over the last 20 years in the U.S. I’d now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on the second quarter results. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Before discussing second quarter results in more detail, recall that effective January 1, 2018, Generac adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition accounting standard. Upon finalizing our accounting under this new standard, at the end of 2018, we made certain immaterial prior quarter reclassifications to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to extended warranties. Therefore, the prior period in our earnings release has been updated accordingly. See our press release for more information related to these reclassifications. Now looking at our second quarter 2019 results in more detail. Net sales for the quarter increased 8.9% to $541.9 million as compared to $497.6 million in the second quarter of 2018. Excluding the $12.4 million of contribution from the Selmec, Captiva, Neurio and Pika acquisitions and the almost $5 million negative impact from foreign currency, core growth rate during the quarter was approximately 7.4%. Looking at our consolidated net sales by product class. Residential product sales during the second quarter increased 8.9% to $268.4 million as compared to $246.4 million in the prior year quarter, with core growth being approximately 8% when excluding the M&A contributions from Neurio and Pika and the slightly unfavorable impact from foreign currency. As Aaron mentioned, home standby generator sales grew significantly once again during the quarter as we continue to execute on the awareness and demand created by baseline power outage activity. Shipments of portable generators were down in the quarters – the current year second quarter as the prior year quarter benefited from retail channel replenishment following elevated outage activity. Looking at our Commercial & Industrial products. Net sales for the second quarter of 2019 increased 6.9% to $230.4 million as compared to $215.6 million in the prior year quarter, with core growth being approximately 6% when excluding the M&A contributions from Selmec and Captiva and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Domestically, as Aaron previously discussed, we continue to see very strong growth from our telecom customers as they harden their cell tower networks to improve reliability and prepare them for 5G rollout. In addition, shipments to our domestic industrial distributors also remain very strong as we continue to drive share gains with our natural gas power generation expertise. Partially offsetting this growth in C&I products, shipments of our C&I mobile products declined year-over-year as our national rental account customers deferred CapEx spending during the current year quarter. Internationally, our C&I products were down modestly on a core basis when excluding the impact of the Selmec and Captiva acquisitions and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency. In the prior year quarter, our Pramac subsidiary benefited from certain large product shipments that did not repeat in the current year. In addition, in Latin America, we saw flat core sales growth during the quarter given certain geopolitical headwinds that are impacting that region. Net sales for the Other products category, primarily made up of service parts and extended warranty sales, increased 21.3% to $43.1 million as compared to $35.6 million in the second quarter of 2018, with core growth of approximately 12% when excluding the strong service business from the Selmec acquisition. A larger installed base of our products and higher extended warranty revenue recognition drove this core increase versus prior year. Gross profit margin was 36.1% compared to 35.9% in the prior year second quarter. A favorable sales mix shift towards higher margin home standby generator sales was partially offset by modestly unfavorable price cost dynamics during the quarter. In recent quarters, we have felt the impact of increased regulatory tariffs, logistics costs, labor rates, commodities and currencies. While we have substantially mitigated these higher input costs through cost outs and price increases, we are still experiencing modestly unfavorable price cost due to the lags in realization. Based on current market conditions, we believe certain of these higher input costs to be transitory in nature and should moderate as we enter the second half of 2019. Operating expenses increased $11.9 million or 12.8% as compared to the second quarter of 2018. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses, excluding intangible amortization, increased 40 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to increased research and development costs associated with our clean energy, connectivity and Lead Gas strategic initiatives. These investments were partially offset by improved operating leverage on the higher organic sales volumes. Adjusted EBITDA, before deducting for non-controlling interest and as defined in our earnings release, was $111.9 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to $102.2 million in the same period last year. The corresponding adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.6% in the quarter as compared to 20.5% in the prior year. The previously mentioned favorable sales mix shift towards higher margin home standby products was mostly offset by unfavorable price cost impacts and the increased research and development costs associated with strategic initiatives. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 11% to $425.9 million as compared to $382.7 million in the prior year quarter, which includes $2.3 million of contribution from recent acquisitions. As I previously discussed, this year-over-year increase reflects strong end market conditions for our home standby and C&I stationary generators. This growth was partially offset by lower shipments of portable generators and C&I mobile products compared to prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment during the quarter was $104.5 million or 24.5% of net sales as compared to $90.6 million in the prior year or 23.6% of net sales. International segment sales increased 1.8% to $116 million as compared to $113.9 million in the prior year quarter, including $10 million of contribution from acquisitions offset by an approximate $5 million foreign currency headwind. Core sales declined approximately 3% versus the prior year due to the timing of certain large projects that shipped out of our Pramac subsidiary during the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter before deducting for non-controlling interests was $7.4 million or 6.3% of net sales as compared to $11.6 million or 10.2% of net sales in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2019 on a consolidated basis. GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $62 million as compared to $53.3 million for the second quarter of 2018. GAAP income taxes during the current year second quarter were $18.8 million for an effective tax rate of 23.4%. This compares to GAAP income taxes in Q2 2018 of $18.4 million for an effective tax rate of 25.3%. The year-over-year decline in the GAAP tax rate was driven by a higher mix of domestic pretax income and additional stock compensation deductions in the current year quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.98 in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $0.82 in the prior year. The specific calculations for these earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release. Adjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release was $74.9 million in the current year quarter or $1.20 per share versus $68.9 million in the prior year or $1.11 per share. This increase in adjusted EPS was driven by the strong sales growth and related improvement in operating earnings previously discussed, partially offset by higher cash income taxes during the quarter. With regards to cash income taxes, the second quarter of 2019 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $14.1 million as compared to $11.1 million in the prior year quarter. The current year reflects an expected cash income tax rate of 17% to 18% for the full year of 2019 while the prior year second quarter was based on an expected cash tax rate of 14% for the full year 2018. This increase in cash tax rate is due to a higher level of expected pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 at this point in the year. Recall that every dollar of pre-tax earnings over and beyond our $30 million tax shield is taxed at the expected GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%. Cash flow from operations was $8 million as compared to $50.7 million in the prior year second quarter, and free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was negative $10 million as compared to $46 million in the same quarter last year. Higher operating earnings in the current year quarter were more than offset by $29 million of additional primary working capital investment, as well as timing differences related to $20 million of tax payments and $13 million of capital expenditures. As we enter the second half of 2019, we expect to monetize a significant portion of our primary working capital, in line with normal seasonality, resulting in strong free cash flow conversion for the full year 2019 of approximately 80% to 90%. Taking a look at our balance sheet. On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new GAAP lease accounting standard. This new standard requires that we recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to operating leases on our balance sheet. As a result, we recognized approximately $40 million of additional other assets and other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet in Q1 to adopt the new standard. As of June 30, 2019, we had a total of $943 million of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.1 times on an as-reported basis. Additionally, at the end of the second quarter, we had $110.4 million of cash on hand and there was approximately $273 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. Both our term loan and ABL facilities mature in the year 2023. With that, I’d now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our updated outlook for 2019.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. As we’ve discussed, end market conditions for our domestic residential and C&I stationary products remain strong and better than expected. As a result, we are raising our guidance for revenue growth for full year 2019 as we now expect net sales to improve approximately 6% to 7% assuming no major power outage events and a baseline power outage level similar to the longer-term average. On a core basis, full year 2019 net sales growth is now expected to be approximately 4% to 5%. Should the outage environment in the second half of 2019 be higher due to an active hurricane season and widespread utility shut-offs in California, we could expect approximately 5% of incremental revenue growth over and beyond our baseline guidance. All of this compares to our previous guidance of 3% to 7% growth on a core basis or 5% to 9% on an as reported basis for the full year. As we discussed last quarter, the high end of the previous range included a major outage event. The comparable range based on our higher guidance this morning is 4% to 10% on a core basis or 6% to 12% on an as reported basis with the high end of the range again, including the potential upside of a major outage activity due to a active hurricane season and widespread utility shut-offs in California. As a result of more favorable sales mix and improved operating leverage compared to previous guidance, we’re also raising our margin expectations for full year 2019. Net income margins before deducting for non-controlling interest are now expected to be approximately 11%, with corresponding adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20% for the year, assuming no major power outages and an average baseline outage environment. Should the outage severity in the second half of 2019 include an active hurricane season and widespread utility shut-offs in California, adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interest could be approximately 21% for the full year of 2019. This updated baseline guidance implies that adjusted EBITDA margins in the second half of the year will improve approximately 100 basis points over the first half of the year. This is largely due to improved operating leverage on higher sales volumes, realized benefits from our profitability enhancement program and favorable trends with input costs as we expect logistics, commodities and currencies to moderate into the back half of the year. Consistent with historical seasonality, our baseline guidance, which assumes no major outage events, anticipates that net sales and adjusted EBITDA margins will build modestly from Q3 to Q4 as we progress through the second half of 2019. Lastly, intangible amortization expense is now expected to be approximately $27 million to $28 million for the year, a $6 million increase from previous expectation primarily as a result of our recent acquisitions. The remaining guidance items provided in previous earnings calls are not expected to change. This concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we’d like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Okay. Our first question is from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ross Gilardi: Good morning, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Ross.
Ross Gilardi: Your home standby generator shipments is up 20%, obviously, very strong. And I think that is off of a pretty tough comp a year ago. Is that the case? Can you remind us what that number was? And can you say how much California was up within that number?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Ross. We don’t break that out. We haven’t historically. I think we added the 20% just to give some additional context this year but – in this quarter. But we can say that it is up strongly as you indicate. And that was without any major outage events. I think – and that’s the think that, when we look at it, and in fact, when we look regionally across the board, we’re seeing strength in a lot of regions. The West obviously, as we’ve talked here as of late, has been very strong. Our teams were wearing out of path to the West here. We haven’t had a tremendous amount of development effort in that market over our history because as we’ve said, there are a lot of reasons for that. But primarily, it’s just been a market that hasn’t experienced a ton of outages, and as such, it just was slower to develop. With the shut-offs and all of the disruption to the grid that’s either been taking place or will be anticipated to take place in the future that the interest level on the product has changed dramatically. And in fact, I would point to just even in the last four weeks, we’ve seen activations and IHCs, again, in-home consultations as we refer to them, we’ve seen just fantastic numbers, which gives us a lot of strength and a lot of confidence in kind of underpinning the updated guidance this morning. So we're really pleased with that business. And I think a lot of us internally, we've all kind of collectively wondered aloud whether we've actually hit a tipping point maybe with home standby where it's kind of moving into more mainstream category and 4.5% penetration, it's may be hard to make that argument. But it sure feels like it's accelerating in the absence of anything major, any type of major catalyst.
Ross Gilardi: And despite some headwinds in C&I and so forth, it seems like you're taking your guide up even though you appear to have some additional growth investment in your numbers. I mean, it seem to show on your cash flow numbers, your R&D as a percentage of sales was up a fair amount. So can you talk about how you're looking at overall growth investment in the various buckets into the second half of the year? And how are you doing on capacity because this has now been an 18-month period where you've had very strong generator shipments, and California which really wasn't that relevant of a market a couple of years ago. So are you contemplating a capacity increase on the West Coast or any place else.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. From a capacity standpoint, I'll deal with that part of the question first. The capacity side of it, obviously, the home standby business has always been an interesting business. When you get events – and really the generator business in general, I shouldn't just put it as home standby. But that residential market in particular is fairly sensitive to when you do get surges in demand, you need to respond. So we've been very careful to build that with flexibility, upside flexibility in mind. And so as we sit here today, and I would say the last kind of major resetting of capacity in that business occurred after Sandy. We worked to expand capacity at that point, both in the supply chain which is oftentimes where we run into some bigger constraints than we do internally. But we refocused our supply chain and our internal capacity after Sandy, so call it 2013, 2014 kind of that next step level change in terms of capacity. We went through that again last year, that exercise, and we made some significant investments both internally, some of which has come online and some of which will come online in the future year. That's some pretty decent CapEx and you've seen our capital spending trend upwards. Some of that is related to some of that growth CapEx around expansion for capacity. But also, we've made some – we continue to grow our supply chain and our sourcing. Some of that is in relation to the tariff environment that we find ourselves in today. We've resourced some components or dual sourced some components to make sure we not only got adequate capacity but also a cost basis for those products and components, which reflects hopefully a lower tariff environment rather than a higher one. But all that being said, to get right to the point, we feel very good about our capacity for home standby, and we're going to continue to add that going forward. Now I'll let York speak to the other.
York Ragen: Yes. I mean in terms of future investments, that's – as you pointed out, you can see it in our R&D numbers, you can see it in our cash flow numbers, the reality is we've been putting in terms of head count, we think of those as investments as well. And when you think about our clean energy initiatives, our connectivity initiatives, our Lead Gas initiatives, those are all things that are going to bear fruit in the future. But you need to resource them upfront, and we believe that with the large opportunities we have in front of us, those are going to be good investments here. But you've got to put them in place beforehand so you can see that impact on margins. And then on the cash flow side, you're right. CapEx, we've had a – from a timing perspective, we front-end loaded our CapEx more this year on…
Aaron Jagdfeld: Some of that around those capacity
York Ragen: Around capacity expansions. So that's a little bit of timing difference there versus prior year. And then working capital, you think of that as an investment as well as you grow and ramp. And as we get ready for the season, not only on the home standby and portable side but on the mobile side of the business with our shore products that we've ramped up those inventories to get ready for the seasonal seasons, so we're ready for that. We've put in working capital in the first half of the year and we expect to monetize that in the second half.
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think all those things just kind of exacerbated the 1H, 2H kind of pacing of our free cash flow, so we're
York Ragen: We feel good about it.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We feel good about it. So that doesn't really change anything fundamentally. It's just – I think it's largely around timing.
Ross Gilardi: Now the California utilities are actually advising their customers to consider buying a generator. And are you seeing a lot of new referrals of business as a result of that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I mean, the utility companies have – they've all taken an interesting approach, and we've reached out to all of them obviously and we have – we've had plenty of dialogue. They're all reluctant to kind of name an OEM partner, which we find to be a little bit frustrating on our part because we think that we could be all working towards the purposes of helping people in their service areas be better prepared, but look, that's their approach. So we can't sit there and wait for the utility to promote one brand, your brand X over brand Y. And I guess in the end result, that's probably not their responsibility. But we've always taken the angle that our responsibility is to grow the market. As the leader in the market with the kind of share position we have and the effort that we've expended to date over the last 20 years to build this market, what we just – that's our cross to bear. It's our mantle. And so we've got that, and we're going to continue to push hard on that here in the market. And so over the last four weeks, we've put together a plan on the page for that market in particular and a lot of it includes much of the same awareness type of building activities that we would typically have. But I would tell you, what's really unique about this situation is we never get the luxury of getting a map where something might happen, right? We always have to react to an event with very little notice oftentimes. And so I do think we have the opportunity here to be a lot more proactive in our efforts. So that's getting us a little bit outside of how we think about developing markets normally, which I think is a good thing. And it's kind of refreshing that way. So we've got, as I said, we have a lot of people out there in the market working to grow that with our existing distribution partners and we're rapidly adding new distribution partners. That really is our focus. And then education, education for inspectors, for utilities, for the municipalities that issue permits. There's just a lot of – we see this every time. There's a new market development effort. It's just a learning curve for everybody, so we're going to get up that curve. That may act as a bit of a constraint on growth in that market this year for us at least in the short term. But longer term, we see that market has a tremendous amount of potential. I mean, if you just run the raw numbers and even get from the 1% that we're at today to the 4.5% where we're at nationally, there is a lot of room to run – to grow the market in a very short period of time in California.
Ross Gilardi: Thanks very much guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you, Ross.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is open.
Mike Halloran: Hey, good morning guys. So following up on the question or the answer you've just given there, maybe can you give some context on the receptivity from a distribution perspective, the ability to expand that? How rapidly is it expanding? The knowledge base, how much of a constraint it is this year? Just provide a little bit more context there. And then maybe the same on the regulation side from an ability to move that forward a little more proactively?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It’s a good question, Mike. I mean, from a distribution standpoint purely, your dealer counts there today in California are less than 200, so we have 6,100 nationwide. So obviously, we have – it’s probably appropriate for 1% penetrated market but not for 4.5% or greater penetrated market. So we anticipate as generally is the pattern that is followed in these instances, we anticipate adding a lot of distribution in that market. And we’re going to start with dealers because the dealer base is probably our most efficient way to reach the end consumer. We also have the most developed tools in terms of sales tools, tracking of leads and such in the dealer channel. But beyond that, I think this is where our omnichannel approach to distribution is really going to pay off and generally does pay off. The fact that we distribute products very widely through the electrical wholesale channel. We have the opportunity. Electrical wholesalers are very prevalent as are contractors in California. We can turn those branches on very, very quickly and put products in the hands of those electrical wholesale branches so that the electrical contractors in the market can get access immediately. So they don’t have to go through all of the steps to become a dealer. They can do that alongside of that, but they can get access to the product quickly and get on that learning curve even faster. On top of that, we have retail outlet relationships. All of the DIY retailers that we distribute products through the U.S., they also have California footprints. Some of them more so than others, but we are currently in dialogue with all of those regional markets for those DIY retailers to have some special programs put together, endcap displays, other types of events where we have dealers in aisles talking about the product, educating consumers, basically training or doing that work that’s going to be necessary to grow the market, to create the awareness around the market. And so that’s in place. To your question on regulation, that is a little bit of a slower grind. That’s almost a hand-to-hand combat type of thing. And we’ve seen this in markets before, whether it’s in the Northeast with Sandy or Michael down in or Irma down in the Southeast, whenever there’s an event that happens, we typically have to go into that market and we have to talk one-on-one with inspectors, with the local municipalities, with the gas utilities, getting gas meter upgrades, getting gas infrastructure upgrades to accommodate the installation of a generator, the permitting that needs to get done, sometimes there’s a lot of misconceptions about that. So we work very hard and thankfully, we have the scale in this industry. We have a whole team of people dedicated to that. And so they do nothing more than interface with that layer, that regulatory layer as we kind of refer to it here across the U.S. And right now, as you can imagine, they’re very focused on the California market in particular as we bring those people up the curve. So it’s hand-to-hand combat. We can only make it move as fast as we can. I think, again, we have the benefit of being proactive here because we’re ahead of the outages. What might – may happen later this fall, I think we’re going to have the opportunity to get ahead of it. But I think it is going to still act as a bit of a throttle plate on or a constraint on what we can actually what we can actually achieve here this year at least. So I think the upside guidance we provided kind of contemplates another $25 million to $30 million of upside potentially on top of what we had called out.
York Ragen: That wasn’t in the previous.
Aaron Jagdfeld: That wasn’t in the previous guidance. So that’s kind of the add for this year. But we think in the future, and we’ll quantify this as we build out our models going forward, but we would obviously expect that to be greater in the years ahead.
Mike Halloran: Yes. That makes a lot of sense. And then on the connected strategy or the power management energy storage strategy, two-fold question here. Just talk about what you’re doing to accelerate some of the penetration opportunities, who you’re partnering with, some of the go-to-market pieces there. And then also how quickly can this be a meaningful contributor to your revenue and earnings beyond what the acquisition has already given you?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Exactly. So – as it relates specifically, I’d kind of put it into two buckets. One is connectivity to the generator, right? remote monitoring of the generator. That is really – there is some ability to monetize that. Clearly, there is a number of levels that we offer customers in terms of the level of monitoring that they want to do with their product. There is a free version of that product that gives people information on a monthly basis. And then on a real-time basis, it’s a product that’s paid for. As a service, it’s paid for annually. So there’s an opportunity to monetize that, but that I would tell you is more about creating customer satisfaction, higher levels of customer satisfaction with customers, making sure we have the highest level of uptime possible with the install base of product that’s out there. So that’s a really good thing. And then also creating additional opportunities for our dealers to connect with customers for preventive maintenance, for repairs, again, all in the interest of uptime, but giving our dealers an opportunity to better monetize within their business model kind of a service and aftermarket support side. That’s on the generator connectivity. Then you’ve got our energy monitoring pieces, the storage and monitoring pieces. That – there, our Neurio acquisition, our Pika acquisition. I think on Neurio specifically as it relates to energy monitoring, we intend to launch a product here in the fourth quarter that will bundle with our existing standby generators. So we’ll have products that will have monitoring capabilities on board. And that’s – the process to do that is in place right now, but we intend to basically build out the value proposition for our homeowner when we think about connectivity. So connecting to the Mobile Link platform will give them more than just a status of their generator in the long term. It’s going to give them ability to see how much power they’re using. It will probably and likely extend to how they may even control the usage of that power. And this is – our vision on this is we think it’s a really important kind of part of thinking of the generator differently than just an emergency standby asset. We think that, that generator could be deployed in a more broadly distributed fashion where that generator is maybe being operated a couple of hours a day for the purposes of avoiding some of the peak rates that utilities charge and in that way could actually be part of the strategy where a homeowner or a business could reduce their overall energy cost. So a lot is developing here, and there’s a lot more to come and we’re going to be able to update people. We actually have an Investor Day coming up on September 4th in New York. And it’s our intent at that point to give people, I think, a better view on where we’re going with not only clean energy but also just the monitoring capabilities, both energy and generator monitoring that we’ve kind of built here.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey Jerry.
York Ragen: Hey Jerry.
Jerry Revich: So every time we’ve seen major outage event with national attention like we’re seeing in California, you folks have been able to deliver higher in-home consultations and a higher sales and build a higher baseline. Is that how we should be thinking about California? Is this a Sandy-type awareness event as you see it? How broad-based has the interest been given all the headlines compared to prior major outage event?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, it is interesting, Jerry, because what – there's been a lot of headlines around it but very few shut-offs to date, right? I think there was one notable shut-off in Northern California, but it was a small, it's like 30,000 people and there's a small outage. But I think it definitely created a conversation for people that this is real. And we do believe there is a very high likelihood. If you just look at how the utilities have kind of spelled out under what conditions shut-offs would occur, those conditions present themselves every year, and not just once or twice a year but a number of times a year. And the way the utilities are describing their efforts around the shut- offs is they're going to be extended periods of time. They're not only just going to shut the grid off initially but they're going to keep it off until they can physically inspect every single mile of line. Now that is – for us, when we hear that and we know just kind of the topography of California, we know the vast nature of the service areas that are being discussed there, this is going to be days of outages. And so when it happens, I think today, I wouldn't say it's reached the stage of a major outage. The interest level is very high and which I think is for us, a leading indicator in the possibility. I think we won't probably see the real impact of this until shut-offs occur. And again, we're highly confident that, that is likely to happen based on all the conditions that have been stated today. But that's something that, should it happen, we do think it would reach the status of a major outage, could in fact do that and it's going to depend on exactly how many people for exactly how long. So we'll have to see how it plays out.
York Ragen: How many times…
Aaron Jagdfeld: And how many times they do it. Frequency is oftentimes an important part of that. But I think, Jerry, when we look at this, to set up for it, I mean it's incredible to think that the service area we're talking about here is 5.5 million connected meters, which represents maybe 11 million to 11 million people that could be without power for an extended period of time. And it's a major area, so how that plays out remains to be seen. Should it happen, will definitely qualify in our eyes as a major outage.
Jerry Revich: And dealer development has been a big part of the way you folks have grown that standby business. Can you just talk about how big that pipeline is? So you spoke about how many dealers you have now, but as you look at the pipeline based on the interest level, what does that California dealer base look like if we fast-forward six to 12 months, how high is the interest level from dealers and how much could the distribution points increase as a result?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So we have roughly a little less than 200 dealers [indiscernible]. We started the year with about 100. So if it tells you the pacing kind of in a six-month timeframe here, we've added. We've almost doubled the number of dealers in that area. Now admittedly, only 100 dealers in our entire network is 6,100. So California is a massive state, fifth largest economy in the world on its own. So it should have more than 100 dealers but I think that's a consequence of just below penetration than it's historically had and the relatively good power quality that California has experienced historically. So we doubled that dealer count already. The interest level is very high. I'm not going to sit here and give you a prediction of where we'll be at the end of year because we have a lot of feet on the ground, lot of boots on the ground and a lot of effort adding distribution. And again, a lot of that distribution expansion, you have to think of it not just in the context of dealers. You have to think of it in the context of our omnichannel approach to it. We have all of these wholesaler branches, this wholesale electrical wholesale branches that we can put product in immediately and our retail outlets we can put product in immediately. Our e-commerce partners are seeing a lot of interest from California residents, shipping product into that market. So I think we're blessed with having this omnichannel approach. I think this is what really serves us well and it's one of the main core tenants of why we've designed it this way is it allows us to expand very quickly into markets where there is a development effort that need to take place. California is going to fall squarely into that. But it's not just signing up the dealers. You have this whole onboarding process, and that takes a while. There's a learning curve with that. We're going to try to accelerate it. We may even have a physical presence in California by year's end because I think we all view this as a unique opportunity where having brick-and-mortar in the state could actually be beneficial to us in terms of accelerating training, accelerating that onboarding process by having our own people housed in California. That's not typical of what we would do in a market. Even after a major event, we might rent a couple of hotel conference rooms or things like that and do some widespread training. But this might end up looking more like a longer-term physical presence in California, given that these power shut-ups are likely to happen over a long period of time and be fairly consistent. So we'll allow that to develop, but we're very bullish on dealer counts are going to go up very dramatically here as we keep going. And we think that, that's something that is going to be an important part of how we grow the market.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chip Moore from Canaccord. Your line is open.
Chip Moore: Good morning. Thanks. Hey guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Chip.
Chip Moore: So curious on you hear that you're going to have sort of Generac-branded energy management storage products by the end of the year. Can you maybe talk a bit more about how you initially? If you call out some new partners, would this be residential solar installers or how do we think about that? And maybe potential for cross-selling of standby generators as well there?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I am, like very excited about this. This is one where we've made a sizable leap into this market, right? We put a lot of capital behind this. So we believe in this. It's been a great rallying point for our team. I think it's completely coincidental that all the things we just talked about in California from a shut-off standpoint have happened at the same time. I mean it's remarkably ironic to me that here was a market we didn't have a ton of distribution or effort going on to as it relates to standby power and we kind of looked at it as, well, there was a little bit of a heavy lift, right, to set up distribution, for energy storage and energy monitoring. And it's almost fallen on our lap. I mean it's the combination of these two things and being able to go after that market, and not just go after new distribution points talking about power generation but going after those new distribution points and talking about energy storage and energy monitoring, things that are very pertinent, top of mind for those types of distributors and distribution points in California. It's been fantastic. You talk about the opportunity to cross-sell. It's great. It's going to be a major way that we're going to go-to-market in the West and in the Southwest, in the Sun states, is going to be through cross-selling. New distribution partners. We're talking to partners – I've been to visit some of the largest residential solar companies here as of late. I've been there personally with our teams just because we're learning. We're all learning at the same rate here on how best to serve this market, how best to partner, what should these programs look like, what should the partnerships look like, is there a cross-selling opportunities within those solar partners. We do believe we're going to need solar as a channel. We think that's a brand-new channel for us. Especially when you think about the mandates for new construction in California, mandating solar in 2020, that it'd be attached to any dwelling, clearly new installations are going to have to have solar partners with them. The 2 million solar installs that are already in the market, we think we can probably effectively get to maybe without meeting the solar partners. If they want to be a part of that, great. If they don't and they want to focus on new installs, that's fine, too. We can focus on that. But with this new product line we're going to introduce in Q4 is kind of our –I'll call it our first phase, which is essentially a rebranding of the existing products that Pika offers and that Neurio offers win and the combination of those form factors that we can sell it as an all-in-one. That's what's going to happen in Q4 this year. By the time we get around the horn, maybe 12 months from –I'll call it Q3, Q4 of 2020, we'll have a second version of the product that will be a little more advanced. And that, again, we're going to share more of those details at our Investor Day in New York on September 4th. But I think it’s important that I think the market, that it's important that we get into the market and see what's going to happen. As far as adoption rates, I look at the growth rates that are out there, and these are not our numbers. What people are talking about for storage are these are big numbers. There was a recent analyst that issued a report, this is a –these are credible of reports. These aren't kind of from fringe places. These are from mainstream kind of places. And we're talking about a $27 billion market by 2030. We think that there's a lot of room to grow. We think that we're going to have a very unique solution, a differentiated solution. And we've got some pretty cool benefits on our side around the selling techniques, our targeted marketing techniques, our awareness building. We're in the middle of shooting an infomercial for our storage device. Nobody else in that market has anything like that. It's a small step, but I think it's an important step and it's an example of, I think, some of the things that we're going to do that haven't been done yet in this market. So I'm very bullish on this. I think it's going to be –I think it's a home run. It's a hand in glove fit for what we've been doing with home standby and, I think it's just –it's a great extension and a great way to leverage all the things that we do really well in that market.
Chip Moore: That’s great. Maybe one follow-up to your point on the potential growth in that market. Over time, do you see yourself sourcing batteries from third-party guys? Or could you go after a lithium ion manufacturer or something like that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So – this is how we see it. This is kind of our view of the world there. We're not going to be battery manufacturer and we don't want to own a battery manufacturer. Battery manufacturing takes a ton of scale to be good at it, good from both a cost position but also the level of scale necessary to effect the cost position needed, as well as the continued investment level needed, right? Chemistries are going to continue to change. Automation is going to continue to improve. That's just not where we want to be. We look at the battery itself, the cells, the lithium ion cells that exist today, we look at those as a component ingredient, a commodity ingredient in a battery pack. And so almost as we would look at, you think of an engine today, an internal combustion engine, the aluminum ingot used in an engine casing is a commodity ingredient. We're not in the aluminum ingot business. We design, and in some cases, manufacture the engine itself, and that's where we think the battery packs themselves. We think that that's in our wheelhouse and something that we can do. But we view the battery themselves, the cells as being a commodity ingredient that we're going to continue to source from others. Now today, and in our acquisition of Pika, they use a third-party battery source. We're likely going to continue to build on that relationship. It's a very good relationship today. We want to build on that. But as the market grows, we may find ourselves in a situation where we need to expand source. I do think that there is a possibility, if the market is going to grow according to the projections that are out there, that capacity could end up being a constraint on market growth long term. So we want to make sure we've got enough partners to be able to make sure that doesn't hold us back from a growth standpoint. But we're not going to be in the battery business.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian Drab: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Brian.
York Ragen: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Drab: Hey, good morning. So on the five points of additional growth, that potential, I'm looking at that and thinking maybe that would require a hurricane that generates another like $50 million in revenue and then these outages in California, think about that as a major event, like that's another $40 million, $50. Is that kind of what needs to happen to get those five points? Or am I kind of off track here?
York Ragen: Yes, I think Aaron alluded to it just on an earlier question. I think our previous upside guidance from last quarter that we included that high end of the range that we talked about. That was somewhere in that $75 million range. And so we added another percent on top of that, which is roughly called $25 million to $30 million. So that’s – given, so I think some of the constraints around expanding distribution, I think initially the initial surge if you will, demand, if they were to turn the power off and when they turn the power off to millions of people, there may be a restricted play on that. So but I guess to answer your question, we put $25 million to $30 million on top of that.
Brian Drab: This is a combination of a potential hurricane and that potential step-up in demand in California, right?
York Ragen: Correct, that’s the 5%.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It assumes both situations, Brian.
York Ragen: But I think it's important to note, our guidance today where we came out with this –the guidance we gave is just the baseline guidance assuming no events and an average level of outage activity and then there's upside. And I think where previously, we talked about 3% to 7% core growth, we actually are incrementally positive on that. So we're taking it effectively to 4% to 10% and so –but –as a result of all the positive things we're seeing in the end markets and the additional upside of California.
Brian Drab: And in those five points, is that related to California? Is that kind of a knee-jerk reaction to the outage event, people running to get their portable generator in large part? Or is it kind of both, standby and portables?
Aaron Jagdfeld: It’s both. I mean largely, there will be a knee-jerk reaction and largely there's going to be some portables that will go into the market. I think the –but it does include –it does contemplate both, Brian.
Brian Drab: Got it. And then the last question. So in California today, what is the penetration of home standby into that market and what percent? And then if that goes to 4.5%, 5% over some period, how long do you think that –how long will that take do you think for you to kind of get to the market average penetration rates in California?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So today, we’re a little less than 1% penetrated in California. Obviously, there's a lot of single family unattached housing in the state that are greater than $100,000 in value. I think one of the really interesting things I'll point out is we've always said that –what's really important is you have to look at the value of the home in relation to the investment, right, in a home standby. The average investment of home standby is between $8,000 and $10,000 completely installed. And when you look at average house prices, that $8,000 and $10,000 in relation to a $300,000 home which is our median average, it's a fairly decent sized investment. So when you look at the median home prices in California, they're materially higher. So you think about that investment in the context of the value of the home there. And all of a sudden, the home standby doesn't sound like that, it doesn't sound that expensive. And so how quickly could the penetration increase, I think there is a couple of factors that are going to influence that. How quickly can we add distribution and how impactful are the shut-offs, right? How frequent are they? And how long do they last? And unfortunately, I don't have exact answers for you on that, Brian. We're going to have to kind of see how that plays out. But I can only tell you that we're going to be pushing very hard at least on the things that we can control there, which is building out the distribution and how rapidly we onboard them.
Brian Drab: All right. Thanks very much.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Great. Thank you.
Operator: I’m showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Aaron Jagdfeld. Please go ahead, sir.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you. We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning, and again, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind everybody that we do have an upcoming Investor Day on Wednesday, September 4th in New York. We look forward to providing an overview of our strategies, growth drivers, long-range targets and other key investment highlights during that event. And more details are going to follow as we get closer to the date. So with that, we’ll conclude our presentation this morning. We thank you for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the First Quarter Generac Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at the time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer.
York Ragen: Thank you very much. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer. We'll begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks York. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter results represent an outstanding start to the year for Generac as we experienced very strong core organic growth of approximately 15% in the quarter. Overall net sales increased 17.6% compared to the prior year when including contributions from the Selmec, Captiva [ph] acquisition, which were slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts during the quarter. EBITDA margins expanded by 60 basis points to 18.5% as compared to the prior year first quarter driven largely by favorable operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, which helped to counteract the impact of higher input costs. EBITDA dollars on a trailing 12 month basis reached an all-time high of $440 million as we continue to demonstrate the earnings power of the company. Strength in end market demand underpinned the increases in the first quarter with interest in home standby generators in particular remaining very robust as increased power outage activity over the last two years alongside the impact of our initiatives to grow the market resulted in continuing penetration gains. Shipments of C&I products were also significantly higher year-over-year as growth in demand for backup power increased, particularly from wireless carriers as they worked to further harden their networks. In addition, we experienced solid organic sales growth within the international segment as our Pramac subsidiary experienced year-over-year increases in spite of strong currency headwinds. Awareness for home standby generators continues to benefit from elevated power outage activity in recent years and remain very strong for the first quarter as activation and in-home consultations both paced well ahead of prior year levels. We have worked very hard over the last two decades to build out the market for home standby generators through our efforts in developing distribution, creating targeted marketing and deploying in home sales processes that have contributed to dramatically increasing the overall awareness and growth of the category. These efforts have delivered a market for home standby generators today that is more than $1 billion annually, but much room for growth remains as penetration rates are still approaching only 4.5% of single-family unattached houses in the U.S. Recall that we estimate each additional 1% of penetration to represent approximately $2 billion of market opportunity at retail prices. As the clear leader in this product category, we continue to focus heavily on growing the market as we believe substantial opportunity exist to further increase penetration and accordingly this remains a core tenant of Generac's powering our future strategic plan. Shipments of domestic stationary C&I generators were also very strong in the first quarter as solid fundamentals drove broad-based growth across a number end markets. In particular orders and shipments of telecom related applications continue to accelerate in the first quarter as nearly all of our major national account customers had various projects underway to harden their wireless networks. As these carriers begin deployment of so-called fifth generation wireless technology, the need for our continuous supply of power to their network sites has never been more important. The increased data speeds and stability of 5G connectivity will provide for a critical foundational layer that will enable some tremendously impactful future technologies. Ensuring that these networks are able to continue without interruption even during power outages is essential for the new services and communications that will be dependent on this 5G technology. Generac is a key supplier of backup power systems to every tier 1 carrier in the U.S., which is a result of our ability to develop unique solutions and provide an unmatched level of support through our nationwide distribution network. Additionally, we believe we are only scratching the surface of the overall global telecom opportunity that exists. With the recent acquisition of Selmec in Mexico, we are now also the number one provider of backup power for the telecom market in Latin America and our Pramac subsidiary has recently began to accelerate their efforts in serving this market as well. We believe that globally we can position the Generac Group of companies as the leader in telecom power and as this important vertical begins another extended investment cycle in the months ahead, we'll be launching several new products specifically for the telecom market. These will include a complete a complete line of direct current or DC backup power systems to complement our already extensive line of gas and diesel alternating current or AC power products as well as a number of continuous duty and hybrid solutions aimed at be given another cycle in the will be launching several new product specific for the telecom market is going to complete specific applications in countries where grid power is not only much less reliable but in some cases nonexistent. In addition to our focus on globally developing certain higher growth verticals such as telecom, we have also worked hard over the last several years to further promote the benefits of natural gas power generators as a substitute for the diesel power systems that have traditionally been used in emergency backup applications. Strict regulation around diesel emissions have driven prices for generators that use these engines considerably higher over the past decade. These higher prices combined with the inherent drawback of these systems due to their refueling requirements as well as additional environmental concerns around potential fuel spills have created an opportunity to use natural gas power generators as a cleaner more economic alternative. With our acquisition of Motortech in 2017 and with an aggressive new product introduction cycle here at Generac, we have brought a number of larger natural gas power nodes to the market and anticipate further expanding our product lines in years ahead. We firmly believe that natural gas has far superior characteristics over diesel in power generation with its abundant supply, low prices, logistical advantages and environmental benefits all contributing to growth rates for gas generators that are roughly double that of diesel. This is another area where global growth has only just begun. The market for gas backup power has mainly been a US phenomenon developing over the last 30 years to the point where 40% of backup power market annually is now gas versus 60% diesel. Outside the U.S., the market for gas has not yet developed but we see many of the same characteristics that have been driving the growth in the US now beginning to exhibit themselves in many other parts of the world. Higher diesel engine prices is a result of tougher environmental regulations coupled with the tremendous overall economics of natural gas are creating a dramatic increase in interest for these products. Our Pramac subsidiary has had a number of recent successes selling gas sets to customers in place of traditional diesel generators. These are units that are now being assembled at our factories in Italy and Spain and we believe this represents an excellent growth opportunity for the company going forward. Demand for our domestic mobile products was lower during the quarter mainly due to timing of capital spending by certain of our national rental account customers, which is expected to shift to the second and third quarters. Largely offsetting the lower national account shipments was increased energy equipment purchases from independent rental businesses during the period. With higher energy prices, a strong economy and the prospect for increased levels of spending on infrastructure projects in the U.S., we believe demand for our mobile products will be higher year-over-year in the quarters ahead and for the full year. In addition to the overall growth we experienced domestically in the first quarter, our international business also grew with shipments to Mainland Europe, the Middle East, China and Brazil all strong to start the year. Although adjusted EBITDA margins for the international segment were slightly lower year-over-year as certain product and regional sales mix was out negatively in the quarter our international segment EBITDA margin on the last 12 month basis, have increased to 130 basis points and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver these margins to a targeted lower double-digit levels. Additionally, we continue to see the benefit of our international expansion strategy with interest in home standby and natural gas gen sets for commercial and industrial applications continuing to grow. As these markets become more familiar with our gaseous product line and our international sales teams gain knowledge and comfort in selling them in their respective regions. I'd also like to make some comments this morning about our most recent acquisitions of Technologies [ph] and Pika Energy. Recall that we announced the deal back on March 13 and the Pika transaction earlier this week. Using the powering our future strategic plan as our roadmap, these transactions represent a bold and decisive step forward for Generac. The market for - the market for managing and storing energy is rapidly developing as it nearly doubled in 2018 and is projected to be a multibillion-dollar opportunity annually in the years ahead. Our acquisition of Neurio gives us access to the energy monitoring and management hardware and software necessary to provide exciting new solutions to our existing standby generator customer base. Neurio's development of high functioning data algorithms around energy consumption allow customers to track their usage at a very granular level, which helps them identify significant savings opportunities. When combined with Pika's expertise and power electronics battery management software and proprietary inverter technologies, we believe that we can bring an intelligent energy savings appliance to this brand new market. From the over two million homeowners that already have solar installed and are looking to dramatically improve the payback of their system, to the millions of homeowners that want to take full control of their energy cost while also providing added relief from short-term power outages, this new solution will be a natural fit. Although very different than the backup power space we serve today, we believe that the market creation opportunity around energy storage is very similar to what we saw with the home standby generator market nearly 20 years ago and that instance our ability to develop omnichannel distribution, consumer marketing content deployed in a targeted fashion and unique in home sales tools to improve sales conversion was critical to creating the market from home standby generators and we believe our experienced inner competencies in these areas will be extremely valuable in growing the nascent energy management and storage market. In addition our strategic sourcing expertise and our ability to bring manufacturing scale to these types of products will ensure that we produce an affordable solution. The combination of awareness, availability and affordability have been the key ingredients in growing the home standby generator market and we believe they will be equally important in developing the market for energy storage. Our continued investments in remote monitoring will also play an important role in connecting new and existing end-users of both our home standby generators and our energy storage systems to dealers and another channel partners thereby ensuring a high level of customer satisfaction and allowing us to further develop unique, new sources of revenue as we work to monetize these installed bases. This is certainly a market that will be global in nature as well and with our manufacturing and distribution footprint now serving over 150 countries, we think that we are in the unique position of being one of the few companies at this stage with the ability to develop and serve the energy monitoring and storage market on a global basis. The energy landscape is set to under grow dramatic changes in the decade ahead as a result of rising cost, grid stability issues and environmental concerns. The days of a home or a business owner buying power from the local utility in the same manner that has existed historically are coming to an end. We believe that development of on-site power from a number of potential sources including solar, wind, geothermal and gas power generation will supplement or possibly even replace the current centralized power model over time. The need to manage monitor and store the power that is generated in this decentralized fashion has the potential to develop into new enormous market opportunity and our recent acquisitions will help us dramatically accelerate the growth of this market and cement our role as a key player as it develops. I would now like to turn the call over to York to provide some further details on the first quarter results. York?
York Ragen: Thanks Aaron. Before discussing first quarter results in more detail, recall that effective January 1, 2018, Generac adopted the new GAAP revenue of recognition standard. Upon finalizing our accounting under the new standard, at the end of 2018, we made certain immaterial prior quarter reclassifications to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to extended warranties. Therefore, the prior period in our earnings release has been updated accordingly. See our press release for more information related to these reclassifications. Now looking at our first quarter 2019 results in more detail, net sales for the quarter increased 17.6% to $470.4 million as compared to $400.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the $14.9 million of contribution from the Selmec, Captiva real acquisitions and the negative impact from foreign currency, core growth rate during the quarter was approximately 15%. Looking at our consolidated net sales by product class, residential product sales during the first quarter increased 14.4% to $217.8 million as compared to $190.5 million in the prior year quarter. As Aaron mentioned, the current year quarter experienced very strong growth once again in shipments of home standby generators as end market demand for these products continue to be robust coming into 2019. Shipments of portable generators, while still strong, were down in the current year first quarter versus the prior year, which included the impact of multiple winter storms that affected millions of people in northeastern parts of the United States. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales for the first quarter of 2019 increased 19.4% to $209.1 million as compared to $175.1 million in the prior year quarter with core growth being approximately 17% when excluding the M&A contributions from Selmec and Captiva and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Domestically, as Aaron discussed, we continue to see very strong growth from our telecom customers as they continue to harden their cell tower networks to protect them from power outages. We believe this to be a prolonged investment cycle for these customers which is underpinning our increased sales guidance for 2019. Internationally, our C&I products grew 12% on an as reported basis and 6% on a core basis when excluding the impact of the Selmec and Captiva acquisitions and meaningful unfavorable impact from foreign currency. This core sales growth came from market share gains and execution of synergies particularly from Mainland Europe, the Middle East, China and Brazil. In Latin America, we saw flat core sales growth during the quarter given certain geopolitical headwinds that are impacting that region. We also continue to make progress on fully integrating the Selmec acquisition into our Ottomotores subsidiary resulting in the power generation leader in the Mexico market. Net sales for the other products category primarily made up of service parts and extended warranty sales increased 25.8% to $43.4 million as compared to $34.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 with core growth of approximately 15%. This strong core growth rate tracks with the rest of our business as the installed base of our products has expanded around the globe. In addition, higher amortization of extended warranty deferred revenue also drove this increase. Gross profit margin was 34.5% compared to 35.5% in the prior year first quarter, a favorable sales mix shift towards higher margin home standby generator sales and price increases implemented since prior-year were more than offset by the Selmec and Captiva acquisition mix and the realization of higher input costs. In recent quarters, we have felt the impact of increased regulatory tariffs, logistics costs, labor rates and commodities. Based on current market conditions, we believe many of these higher input costs are transitory in nature and should moderate as we enter the second half of 2019. Over the long run, we attempt to mitigate the impact of higher input costs to pricing actions and profitability improvement initiatives. Operating expenses increased $5.4 million or 6.3% as compared to the first quarter of 2018. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses excluding intangible amortization declined 180 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to improved operating leverage on the higher organic sales volumes. The increase in operating expense dollars over the prior year was primarily driven by incremental variable OpEx on the strong sales growth and increase in employee headcount related to our lead gas and connectivity strategic initiatives and additional recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions. These items were partially offset by lower international operating expenses which were impacted by the weaker Euro. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company as defined in our earnings release was $85.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to $70.2 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin before deducting for non-controlling interests was 18.5% in the quarter as compared to 17.9% in the prior year. This 60 basis point increase compared to prior year was mostly due to the previously mentioned improved operating leverage on the organic increase in sales which helped to offset the impact of higher input costs. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments, domestic segments sales increased 18.7% to $359.2 million as compared to $302.7 million in the prior year quarter. As I previously discussed, this significant increase reflects strong and market conditions for our home standby and C&I stationary generators driven by higher power outage severity and a favorable economic environment. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter was $81 million or 22.5% of net sales as compared to $65.5 million in the prior-year or 21.6% of net sales. International segment sales increased 14.1% to $111.1 million as compared to $97.4 million in the prior-year quarter including $14.3 million of contribution from acquisitions and a foreign currency headwind of approximately 6%. Core sales growth was approximately 6% due to strong growth across our Pramac subsidiaries as we continue to drive market penetration across the globe. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter before deducting for non-controlling interest was $6.2 million or 5.5% of net sales as compared to $6.3 million or 6.5% of net sales in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2019 on a consolidated basis, GAAP net income attributable to the company in the quarter was $44.9 million as compared to $33.6 million for the first quarter of 2018. GAAP income taxes in Q1 2018 were $11.4 million for an effective tax rate of 25.3%. This compares to GAAP income taxes during the first quarter of 2019 of $15 million or an effective tax rate of 24.7%. The modest year-over-year decline in the GAAP tax rate is primarily due to fluctuations in pre-tax earnings mix as we generate more profits in lower tax jurisdictions in the current year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.76 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $0.42 in the prior-year. The specific calculations for these earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release. Adjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release was $56.5 million in the current year quarter or $0.91 per share versus $46.1 million in the prior year or $0.74 per share. The strong sales growth and related improvements in operating earnings just discussed were partially offset by higher cash income taxes during the quarter. With regards to cash income taxes, the first quarter of 2019 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $10.5 million as compared to $5.4 million in the prior year quarter. The current year reflects a cash income tax rates of 17% for the full-year 2019 or the prior-year first quarter which was based on a cash tax rate of 13% for the full-year 2018. This increase in cash tax rate is due to a higher level of expected pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 at this point of time last year. Cash flow from operations was $14.6 million as compared to $29 million in the prior-year first quarter and free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was negative $600,000 as compared to $23.3 million in the same quarter last year. Higher operating earnings in the current year quarter were more than offset by increased incentive compensation payments related to fiscal 2018 performance and higher levels of capital expenditures. In addition, inventory levels increased approximately $44 million during the quarter as we continue to build stock for the peak season across the majority of our product categories and due to pull ahead of purchases to avoid potential regulatory tariff increases. We expect to monetize the majority of this inventory build in the coming quarters as demand picks up in line with normal seasonality. Taking a look at our balance sheet, on January 1, 2019 we adopted the new GAAP lease accounting standard. This new standard requires that we recognize rate of use assets and lease liabilities related to operating leases on our balance sheet. As a result, we recognize approximately $40 million of additional other assets and other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet in Q1 to adopt the new standard. As of March 31, 2019, we had a total of $930 million of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2.15 times on an as reported basis. Additionally, at the end of the first quarter, we had $161.3 million of cash on hand and there was approximately $285 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. Both our term loan and ABL facilities mature in the year 2023. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our updated outlook for 2019.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks York. As we have discussed, our end market conditions for domestic, residential and C&I products remains strong and better than expected. In addition, our recent acquisitions of Neurio and Pika have accelerated our entry into the energy management storage market. As a result, we are raising our guidance for revenue growth for full-year 2019 as we now expect net sales to improve between 5% to 9% depending on the severity of power outages during the year which is an increase from the 3% to 7% growth previously forecasted. On a core basis, full net year sales growth is expected to be approximately 3% to 7% which is an increase from the 2% to 6% core growth previously expected. Seasonally, we now expect net sales in the first half of the year to grow approximately 12% to 14% on an as reported basis and 9% to 11% on a core basis. For the second half of 2019, we expect net sales growth to be approximately flat to up mid-single digits on an as reported basis. The low end of the range would assume no major power outages and an average baseline outage of environment while the high end of the range would assume more elevated outage activity which could include a major power outage event during the second half of the year. Net income margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are now expected to be between 10.5% to 11.5% for the full-year with adjusted EBITDA margins also before deducting for non-controlling interest, now expected to be between 19.5% to 20.5% for the year. Importantly the low end of the range would assume no major power outages and an average baseline outage environment and the high end of the range would assume more elevated power outage conditions. The modest decline in margin expectations compared to our previous guidance is primarily driven by the Neurio and Pika acquisitions and a higher mix of C&I product sales. As we enter the market for energy management and storage, we plan to further expand our product development efforts and build out the infrastructure needed to commercialize and penetrate this market. While we expect these initiatives to be slightly dilutive to earnings in the near-term, we believe the strategic importance to be significant as the macro opportunity for energy management storage should grow quickly in the future. Consistent with historical seasonality, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the second half of the year to be relatively higher to the first half with the sequential improvement now anticipated to be approximately 250 to 400 basis points depending on the power outage environment experienced during the year. This improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins in the second half is largely due to improved operating leverage and sales mix, realized benefits from our profitability enhancement program and favorable trends with input costs as we expect logistics, commodities and currencies to moderate into the back half of the year. Lastly, stock compensation expense is now expected to increase to approximately $16 million to $17 million for the year primarily as a result of our recent acquisitions. The remaining guidance items previously provided during our last call are not expected to change. For full-year 2019, operating and free cash flow generation is once again expected to be strong and follow historical seasonality benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow which is expected to be over 90% for the year. This concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first response in the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Conference Call Participant: Hi, good morning everyone. This is Ben [ph] on for Jerry.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hi Ben.
Unidentified Conference Call Participant: So just you guys were very active with M&A this quarter, going for the go forward do you have the full suite of products that you think you need to execute on your strategic focuses and or do you still remain in the marketplace for any missing pieces that you need to fill out the portfolio. And can you kind of give us well, give us a timeframe of profitability across those different businesses?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, it's a great question, Ben. And while we don't give specific comments on our pipeline, we have been very active. I think the Neurio acquisition represented our 14th, or 15th acquisition here in the last seven years and more recently here as indicated by our prepared remarks, we've been very focused on both building out our capabilities geographically but also into some of these newer spaces like energy monitoring storage. With respect to your question, do we have all the pieces, I think that we have a lot of great pieces in fact I think the pieces that we have acquired really give us the position that we desired to go after this market with a lot of vigor. That being said, I think there are some other areas that that could be potentially bolted in to augment some of those things in energy management and energy storage. I won't comment specifically on them here but we are continuing to look at that space. Our pipeline is full of a number of potential companies that that could give us some additional opportunities there whether it be in the commercial and industrial spaces or whether it be in certain aspects of the management or monitoring. I think that there are a couple of things that we could do there. Also geographically, I would say Captiva which we did in the first quarter was a way for us to get an entry point into India which we had not had prior. There are a couple of areas of the world where we still feel we have where we lack representation. So I would say that our pipeline also would have the types of acquisitions there that would give us the kind of manufacturing and distribution footprints that we think are important for us to be successful in these areas. As far as the question of profitability on these acquisitions, again most of them are fairly small in size. So they don't have an outsized impact in terms of dilution, we did call out a little bit of dilution here with EBITDA margins as a result of the recent acquisitions. But it's minor, it's quite small. I think in terms of the strategic importance of what we've done, we feel very good about that being a really solid investment for the company and for our future. And that that's going to ramp quickly, when we look at all the indications around the energy monitoring and the energy storage market, the people who have been tracking this for a number of years, I think what really caught our eye is just how quickly it expanded last year that that entire market which is admittedly small, so you're working off of a small base but it doubled last year. And it's projected to double again this year and so we think that there is going to be a pretty fast ramp here and so while in the near term, it may be dilutive, the impact. I think certainly over the long-term our view is it's going to be very accretive to the overall enterprise.
Unidentified Conference Call Participant: Got it. And then in the mobile business, I believe in the prepared remarks you called out a shift in volumes of rental customers into later quarters. Can you just maybe elaborate on that. And can you give us an idea of how you give visibility of those volumes actually coming through in the coming quarters?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, it's another good question. That industry is at least for us with our share, we're probably over index to the national account customers there. In fact in our prepared remarks, we actually we'd like to see some of the independent rental house growth that we saw. That's a good kind of, I would say counterweight to the National Accounts, National Accounts are great. We love them, we serve them very well. We think we have a unique formula to doing that, it's why I think we serve in places like the Telecom spaces and others we serve major customers like that in the retail spaces. We do a very good job of that and the rental space is no different. But they were a little bit slow to get out of the gate this year, one or two of them in particular. And what we've seen is we've seen order rates here pick-up recently. So that's why I think we have the confidence to say that that's going to be something that's coming in the back half of the year and we have a lot of dialog with those rental houses as well. So I think we have pretty good visibility on what's going to happen. It's not perfect obviously things can change but at least based on what we see today, we would see quarter-over-quarter growth going forward, year-over-year growth excuse me in the quarters ahead and full-year growth as a matter of fact as well for that product line.
Unidentified Conference Call Participant: Got it. Thank you very much.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Your next response is from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Jeff.
York Ragen: Hey Jeff.
Jeff Hammond: Just good quarter in home standby. Just can you just update us on what you're seeing in terms of activations and inquiries and what that suggests for kind of pipeline into 2Q and can you just talk about if weather would seem to be impacting a lot of companies, did it help or hurt you in terms of ability to install et cetera? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, good question Jeff. What we're seeing today, we continue to see strength in activation rates on home standby, in-home consultations a little bit of moderation there but that's only because the comps got really large versus last year, we had the nor'easters in the back half of Q1. So a lot of IFC activity at this time last year. That being said, I mean we're holding our own on IFCs and in particular when you compare it to previous years it's quite a bit elevated. So that gives us a lot of confidence that the trend is going to continue and probably more importantly is field inventories are extremely lean for home standby. I think what has happened here is our teams have we've tried to be very disciplined around the promotional environment for that category. I think in years past, we would have maybe scheduled a national promo in Q1 timeframe, we didn't do that this time around. We did some promoting at our national conference this year which was well attended by the way over 2500 dealers just an amazing conference. But we had, we did a little bit of promoting there but by and large, it's really surprised us in terms of the underlying strength. And so we've been disciplined here and that discipline though has worked to kind of drain some of the field inventories out as I think our channel partners maybe wait us out a bit for a more promotional environment. And I think if seasonality plays out the way that it would, we're going to do some promotion of course as we would seasonally and we've got a national promotion schedule here in Q2 but we like the trends that we're seeing and as far as weather's impact, weather obviously is kind of an interesting thing for some companies it hurts them, for us it can help as long as there's outages that go with it. I think when it gets really cold and when there's a lot of snow, there's difficulty in installing products and maybe where it hurt our business this year. If I call it anything in Q1, we actually didn't talk about in prepared remarks but our core business was softer in Q1, really as a result of just a slow start to Spring. It's especially up here in the Upper Midwest. I'm not sure we're ever going to see Spring but it actually snowed this past weekend which to call the weather poor would be, I think generous. But the weather's been off to a slow start with Spring and that was a little bit of a downer for the core products business which depends on that that warmer weather to really kind of kick into season here. Thankfully in the last couple of weeks, we've seen some nice signs there. I think it's been quite a bit warmer in other parts of the country just not quite up here yet. But weather, I wouldn't call it, I wouldn't call it a headwind nor a tailwind I think in Q1 and it was pretty, pretty balanced across the entire enterprise.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then just coming back to the acquisitions and the strategy, one can just as you look at Neurio and Pika like what's the mix of commercial versus res, is it mostly res, kind of how do they go to market, how do you kind of put it together with your home standby and your dealer network and just trying and wondering how that all comes together as you pull it all together? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, and that's obviously the area of focus and one of things that we really like about this. So your first part of your question is residential versus commercial, the majority of what Neurio and Pika are focused on is residential in nature. That being said, Pika has commercial oriented products as well. These are both pretty, they're not necessarily new entities per se in terms of age, relatively young in terms of a decade old or sooner than that. But they haven't quite gotten a ton of systems out there. Now Neurio has delivered a couple hundred thousand of their energy monitoring devices into the market and their newer energy monitoring and management devices will be just hitting the market here more recently. The go to market strategy is pretty clear though, what we're going to do is we're going to take that big page out of the playbook of home standby and we're going to run those plays, it's a student body right all day long there in terms of awareness, availability and affordability. So focusing on omnichannel distribution, so taking these products to retailers to wholesalers on a direct basis to our contractors, our direct channel, it's going to introduce us to new channel partners potentially in the solar industry. The area of first interest for us is people that already have installed solar systems. There are roughly two million solar installations around the U.S. and only 2% of those installations actually have a battery backup system. The addition of a battery backup system has come down nicely in price over the last several years and with the addition of that, you can dramatically improve the payback on your the money you've already invested in solar. And it gives you a lot more flexibility and you couple that with Neurio's monitoring and energy management and what you get is not only a way for people to improve the payback on their solar systems and get more control but it can help them actually save on their energy bills. And this is where we think the big differentiating factor between what we've done with home standby, so this is where the playbook deviates. Home standby is all about reliability. It's about long-term outages and major outages. And that's and grid stability type issues. That's an industry, that's fundamentally different than what we see forming here with energy management storage. We see this as being about energy savings. We see this about being about the changing energy landscape that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And so using our distribution our 6,000 dealers, the 1400 rooftops that we have for wholesalers, the thousands of points of light that we have in retail and other channel partners to push these products into, we look at the people who are doing this today in energy storage and energy monitoring. They don't have nearly the developed distribution that we have. They don't have nearly the capabilities and consumer marketing, targeted marketing that we have developed and we've developed that circuit because of home standby, they don't have the in-home selling capabilities that we have, the tools that we've developed like power play. And so we think putting all that together is going to be really critically important in developing that market. And I would say one last comment on this point. The western part of the U.S. is where you're seeing a lot of activity around storage, that's not necessarily a strong market for us in home standby historically, power quality is a little bit better, although recently it's kind of broken down in California because of some of the issues around grid stability and issues with PG&E in particular. PG&E made an announcement earlier this week that their grand plan for heading off wildfires is when the wind blows they are going to shut off the grid to 5.5 million people for maybe days at a time. That could obviously develop for us into a nice home standby market because the battery is not going to get you days of backup. But that being said, I think we can have that market is going to be a great complementary market for us with home standby and with the storage markets to develop. And so we're going to be very focused on growing a market that up until this point, I don't want to say we've ignored it but it just really hasn't been there for standby. So I think it's going to be a nice complementary region of the country to what we're, what we're already doing everywhere else.
Jeff Hammond: Okay, good color. Thanks so much.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Your next response is from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hi, Chris.
Christopher Glynn: Good morning, I was wondering if anything's happening with resale and upgrade. Curious what proportion of stand by today is replace and upgrade versus expanding the penetration rates and what kind of movement, you're seeing along those lines?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, thanks Chris. It's another area we watch, we track it very closely. We have the ability to do that with all the data and our activation data and homeowner file that we have here. So I think we have a very good view on this and we see a reliable march upward in replacement. The category's been around 20 years now and in fact, some of the older parts of the market are starting to hit that 20-year mark and that's the life expectancy of these products is between 10 and 20 years, pretty reliably. And as we get into that, today it's about 5% of the sales that we experienced in home standby are four that we can tie directly to replacement but every quarter that goes by, it is pretty cool because you can kind of see it just in the math. We see a reliable march upward in that number.
Christopher Glynn: It sounds good. And question on the dynamic around the kind of wave emerging around 5G and overall telecom backup. What's your view of the duration of this, it seems like it might be sticky for a while and corollary to that, how accessible is the international opportunity for telecom customers given your footprint and legacy incumbents outside the U.S.?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Right. So I would say and I think I may have mentioned in my prepared remarks, an extended cycle and extended up cycle that we're entering here, when we've seen this in the past and we've been serving this market now for almost 30 years with backup power, so we have longstanding relationships, we have a lot of cycles, we've been through both up and down. And typically when we enter a cycle like this and we really entered it kind of in the back half of last year, we really saw it start to pick up, beginning of last year into the back half. And it really has picked up steam here in Q1, that has generally, historically based on our experience that's been a couple of years of a run as those just the projects cycle themselves for them to acquire the equipment, the carriers to acquire the equipment actually get the project management together and get the installations in as they build out those networks that they harden those networks. It generally runs several years, so two to three years might not be out of bounds in terms of what to think about that and obviously things can come and go that can change that. If there are economic conditions that change, if there are M&A activity sometimes can put a pause on those activities., if there is rationalization of network assets and things like that to be had in an acquisition or in M&A. But we think it's going to we're headed into an up cycle here. Second part of your question on the international opportunity, how accessible is that. I'll address accessibility in two ways. One accessibility in terms of our footprint. I think this is the beauty of what we've been doing internationally. We have added a tremendous amount of footprint to the company in terms of manufacturing footprint and distribution footprint globally, footprint that didn't exist, four or five years ago we had none of that. Today it's over 20% of our total revenues are coming from outside the U.S. and Canada. And that's the raw accessibility in terms of just having physical presence there. Now accessibility in terms of making those relationships and creating those partnerships and how do we win? How do we unseat some of the incumbents that may be serving the market today. A good example would be Selmec, the acquisition we did down in Mexico, classic example and we already owned a company down there Ottomotores, that we bought I think roughly five or six years ago, six years ago we acquired that company but they really weren't in the telecommunications space, they didn't have any relationships, they weren't serving that market with the right product. Selmec on the other hand is that's squarely in the bull's eye of not only their customer base but also their product offering. And so the acquisition, the combination of those two companies has put us vaulted us to the number one position in Latin America in telecom. So you juxtapose adding it to our number one position in North America, U.S. and Canada serving the telecom market and we look at what Pramac is doing, Pramac always kind of dabbled in it but they've never, I think focused on it as much as we're intending to focus on it as a global enterprise here. We're building a team globally that we have our regional teams but we're building a team globally to both look at the products that we offer because they do differ regionally, but also those relationships. What we're finding is interesting is that you see some of the relationships with the International or the U.S. based carriers, those U.S. based carriers are actually starting to branch out internationally. And so we're trying to leverage those relationships where it makes sense. So in terms of trying to unseat a new incumbent, we may not have to unseat somebody because the carrier themselves may be new to that market and we may already be our preferred supplier them either in Latin America or in the U.S.. So obviously we have a lot of work to do in the longer term play but we think that the telecom market in particular is just one of those verticals that is not going away. The U.S. market is 300 cell sites, 300,000 cell sites, 100,000 of which have backup power, 200,000 don't. So penetration is maybe a third but 5G if you're going to have 5G technology and if people are going to drive around and automated cars and we're going to have all kinds of artificial intelligence and other high functioning things going on technologically, 5G has to be completely uninterrupted completely. I mean it can have if a Hurricane comes through, you can lose mobility, you cannot drive or if you get a cell site that goes down. So these networks they're being architected differently, they're being hardened differently. And we see ourselves being a big participant in that on a global basis.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you, helpful.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Chris.
Operator: Thank you. Your next response is from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore: Morning, hey thanks. Congrats on the strong momentum. Maybe one area we didn't touch on was healthcare. I think you called out some good demand there. Maybe you can update us on some of the trends you're seeing in that market?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, healthcare remains another important vertical for us. And you're right. Chip, I didn't mention it this morning directly maybe out of respect of time for everybody. Just we had so much to talk about but the healthcare market's been good. You know it's been one of those verticals that continues to grow. It's actually a vertical where we're focused on a more direct basis and engaging with those customers. And this is maybe a bit different from our normal industrial distribution channel where we would go through our fixed distributors and we've got about 25, 30 fixed distributors across the U.S. and in other parts of the world for that matter where we sell products through. But there are certain verticals, telecom being one of them as we talked this morning but also healthcare where we will sell on a direct basis because we believe that that's how those channels want to buy frankly in terms of and they need to be served because of the breadth of the offering they need and also the breadth of coverage that they desire. More specifically the Florida Healthcare opportunity that we've talked about coming off of the events of the last couple of years, there were some regulations that were put in place, a lot of companies had to comply with those regulations for critical care facilities by the end of the year, so that they can have backup power that not only backs up certain critical circuits but also HVAC which was I think the miss in previous regulations and the addition of HVAC obviously adds quite a bit of additional power needed, power needs and the generators grow in size considerably. That went into effect at the end of the year but there were a lot of waivers issued to a good number of facilities down in Florida. And so that leaked over here into the first quarter, we did see some more volume here and that'll probably kind of run its course as we get through the second quarter of this year. But we're starting to see interestingly enough as we kind of thought this might play out, there are several other states that are looking at adopting similar regulations as Florida now, I mean it might be hard to argue that the critical care facility markets bigger outside of Florida than it is there. That's a big market, there is a lot of just given the demographics and everything else. But obviously as we see that and what we think will probably play out over time is on a national basis, we'll see regulations change in a similar fashion because honestly it's the right answer. So we continue to talk to people about that, what we really like about that is the traditional solution of diesel gensets, we're able to convince many of these critical care facilities that gas is a better solution. There are some regulations on the books that that make that a little harder but we're working to change those as well to make gas an acceptable substitution both economically but also from a regulatory standpoint, but it's a very good vertical for us in the future.
Chip Moore: Absolutely, thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Chip.
York Ragen: Thanks Chip.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next response is from Brian Drab of William Blair.
Brian Drab: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey Brian.
York Ragen: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Drab: Just a quick modeling question first on Pika and Neurio, you're not giving us the revenue but I think what you're - I think what you're signaling is that these are going to add maybe about point revenue growth. These are each maybe like in the $5 million to $10 million revenue range. Am I far off there?
York Ragen: Yes, that's fair. Like Aaron said, these are more startup businesses that are getting into this emerging category, so their revenues are in that range, Brian.
Brian Drab: Right. And I understand the point here is the technology in building the portfolio?
York Ragen: The team and the technology that's what we're after.
Brian Drab: Right, right. Got it. Unfortunately, I have to build a model and nail down the details.
Aaron Jagdfeld: That is unfortunate.
Brian Drab: Yes, we'd like to think longer term, we've got to build these models as well. So on the mobile market, Aaron you talked a little bit about that and can you talk about what percentage of total revenue now is tied to energy. And are you seeing. Is this a lot to do with kind of reduction activity in the Permian. And do you need there's a lot of companies do for that pipeline capacity to come on in the second half of the year and activity to start-up before you see recovery or is it not so much that specific event that's causing you challenge?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, I mean the energy piece is still a pretty small piece for us Brian, it's not I wouldn't call that out specifically is more. Actually, I think the National account pullback was less about energy excuse me and more about just I think General rentals, the general rental market just they were a little bit slow to get off the dime purchasing, these guys have bought remember the national accounts have been doing, they've been through a pretty strong week fleeting exercise over the last couple of years. So they're kind of absorbing all that fleet and actually they would tell you their utilization statistics were a little bit soft in Q1, as they kind of were rationalizing some of this equipment. So putting more out to pass through so to speak and getting out of the secondary market and kind of thinning out the herd a bit. All indications are that they intend to be back and in the second, third and the remaining quarters, your fourth quarter as well. And I actually that's on the back of firmer energy prices. What's going on in the Permian? We've actually been seeing a lot of opportunities in the Permian actually from our specialty rental guys, who not the national rentals but actually the special rental companies have been we've seen a marked increase uptick here as we start the second quarter in natural gas gensets which go are directly being used in those energy plays to generate power off of the flare gas and off the wellhead gas. And so we're seeing a nice lift there and I think with the energy prices being in the ranges that they're at here, it's very supportive for continued investment in the types of mobile equipment that we would typically see there. And then that alongside as I said kind of the general recap, the general rental market kind of getting going here what gives us a lot of kind of confidence there is that the independent companies we're still buying in Q1, we had inventory available and we saw a nice actually a nice shift away from rental, the national rentals and into the independent rentals. So the markets there, I think it was just it's a purely in our view a timing issue mainly attributable to just these national rental accounts from just from Q1 shifting into the later quarters.
Brian Drab: Okay. Got it. And then just quickly, York you mentioned the tariffs that that could come, that could create a new tailwind or new headwind. Can you talk about what the worst case scenario is there and what you're looking at?
York Ragen: Yes, I think well we've been paying the 10% tariffs on list three started up in September of last year. So we've been, we've been absorbing that for the last call it six months. So what we're seeing run through our P&L is those tariffs. Obviously, we reacted to those tariffs with pricing actions and whatnot. But I guess it's still yet to be seen, if they negotiate away. The threat of the 25% tariff but that that isn't in our - I guess we don't have that necessary in our math, in our outlook statement. But what we have - but what's running through our run rate today is that the 10% tariffs. So it's and we've been absorbing that through pricing actions and other cost reduction initiatives.
Brian Drab: Got it, okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next response is from the line of Stanley Elliott of Stifel.
Stanley Elliott: Good morning guys. Thank you for fitting me in. A quick question on this energy management business. Just to make sure, I'm hearing it correctly it sounds like that there is a stronger preference for M&A one, two on the SG&A side and then on the R&D side that going through the distribution channel, we shouldn't see much of an change there and then the R&D piece, probably don't need to see much of a change I mean I'm just trying to get a sense for how this business is going to look longer term then I guess then the last question would be kind of with the growth rates that you're seeing right now, is there any way you could ballpark when maybe this becomes I don't know like 5% or pick a number of overall revenues?
York Ragen: Yes, thanks Stanley. Just to kind of parse your question there. So you're right, I don't think we need to add a ton in distribution in like headcount there, although the western parts of the U.S. as I mentioned today we're pretty underrepresented. In terms of distribution, so I think if we're going to put dollars towards distribution anywhere it's going to be in that area. I think from the standpoint also though in sales and marketing effort, the way that we built the home standby market, we developed in-home selling tools, we developed targeting marketing - targeted marketing types of approaches. I think we can leverage a lot of what we've already created there but we still will have to buy media to go out and develop that market, right. So it's one thing to use what we already have is another thing to deploy what we have aimed at a new market. So it's not going to be at the same level of spend what we're doing with home standby. But it will be an increase over where we're running today and that's what we've kind of I think at least begun to model here as we think about, as we think about the future. As it relates to product development, yes, we bought these companies because we like the products they have, the technologies they have. But we need to continue to invest in that, so we can build it out. There are opportunities in the commercial space that we want to build out, there are opportunities in new generations of products, battery costs continue to drop. Technologies continue to change. We've got to tie the products together with our existing home standby products. So there is product development effort there and there's cost. Obviously, whenever you talk about product development efforts, so I wouldn't say it's zero. I wouldn't say it's massive because I think that's why we bought the companies. But at the same time, it's something that we would - we would say is probably reflected in our comments this morning in the way we've kind of phrase them. Longer term, it's really hard to pin like what's 5% but the market is forecasted to grow dramatically as I said it doubled in 2018. That market is set to double again in 2019. We're going to have an Investor Day later on this year and I think we'll talk a little bit more about this market as we continue to learn about the trajectory there, how we want to approach it. I think we have some really solid ideas on it and that's what we've done, what we've done here and we're very bullish on the future. When does it hit kind of critical mass, when does it 5%, when does it hit 10%, you're probably realistically it's probably three, four or five years out before you're closing in on numbers like that, where it's meaningful. I do think that it's, we think in a couple of years' time, it'll go from being dilutive to being neutral or accretive, so I think that's realistic to think about and that that won't take very long because we think the growth rates are such that we'll be on the other side of that equation pretty quick in our opinion.
Stanley Elliott: Multi-billion dollar opportunity?
York Ragen: Yes, it's forecasted to be a multi-billion dollar market very quickly. So we're really excited about. I mean it represents a whole new area for us and we look we've looked for a long time for kind of I'll call it ancillary products that we could bolt into our this awesome thing we've built in home standby and we've looked at a lot of different things and we've just we haven't really found the right thing that fit naturally that didn't distract from what we're trying to do in home standby and actually fit with the channel and everything else we're trying to do in creating a market, market creation type of activities. This energy monitoring and storage market is spot on and it could be huge. It could be as big or bigger than home standby. And if you look at the way it's projected, it could be twice the size of home standby in not too long times, not too long the time. So incredibly excited about it. We really like our positioning here. We think that the solution that we're putting together by taking Pika and Neurio and our expertise in power electronics manufacturing and sourcing putting all that together we're going to get - we're going to be able to bring to the market a very unique solution, a very differentiated solution from the solutions that are on the market today and that I think is going to give us a fantastic position to replicate what we've done with home standby. I don't think it's going to take 20 years either. I think we can be able to do it lot faster because of all the learning cycles we have under our belt and very bullish about that. It's going to be pretty exciting stuff going forward.
Stanley Elliott: Very interesting, indeed. Well thanks for the time and best of luck to you guys.
York Ragen: Thanks Stanley.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Jagdfeld.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Great, thank you. We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning and we look forward to reporting our second quarter 2019 earnings results which we anticipate will be at some point early in August. Thank you again for your time this morning. Good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a good day. You may all disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-14 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2018 Generac Holdings, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at the time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call maybe recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Chief Financial Officer, York Ragen. Mr. Ragen, you may begin.
York Ragen: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We'll begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you, York. Good morning everyone. Happy Valentine's Day. Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results capped off a fantastic year for Generac in 2018 as we again experienced record quarterly sales through strong core organic growth of approximately 12%. Overall, net sales increased 14% compared to the prior year when including the contribution from the Selmec acquisition which was slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts during the quarter. For the full year, net sales grew more than 20% to over $2 billion with EBITDA margins expanding 210 basis points over the prior year to 21% or approximately $425 million. Continued strength in all of our end markets underpinned the increases in 2018 with demand for home standby generators in particular remaining very robust throughout the year as increased power outage activity over the last two years alongside the impact of our initiatives to grow the market resulted in continued penetration gains. Shipments of C&I products were also significantly higher year-over-year driven by continued recovery in domestic mobile products and growth in demand for backup power in the telecom and healthcare sectors. In addition, strong organic sales growth was again experienced within the international segment, which was leveraged into further improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. Awareness for the home standby generators has benefited from elevated baseline power outage activity during the past two years with end user activations remaining very strong in the fourth quarter and the full year, particularly in the northeast and southeast regions. Our residential dealer base continued to expand during the year to an all-time high of more than 6,000. Production levels of home standby generators were an all time highs for the company during the quarter and demand for these products remain strong heading into 2019. Shipments of portable generators were lower in the quarter compared to the prior year, which included the impacts of major hurricane activity but were up significantly for the full year driven by the elevated outage activity, replenishment of channel inventories, and additional retail placement experience. Demand for domestic mobile products remained strong during the quarter and for the full year as the equipment rental markets further recovered in 2018 with the rebound in the oil and gas markets and increased construction activity both contributing to the continuing fleet refresh cycle. Demand for stationary domestic C&I generators also increased in the fourth quarter as the elevated power outage environment drove broad based growth across a number of end markets. In particular, certain of our telecom account customers are investing heavily in hardening their networks in response to their customers’ needs for consistent uptime. Demand for natural gas fueled generators was particularly strong during the quarter and for the full year. While diesel gensets remain the dominant choice for C&I backup power globally, natural gas generators continued to gain acceptance as a substitute due to their economic and operational advantages. In addition to the growth experienced domestically in the fourth quarter and for the full year, our international business also saw a strong growth in mainland Europe, Latin America, Australia, Brazil, and China. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year for our international segment continued to expand with improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes being the biggest contributor to the improvement. We are also seeing success with the introduction of our gaseous fuel products into markets outside the U.S. and Canada, with both residential and C&I products experiencing impressive growth rates during the year, albeit off a small base. We achieved a number of significant milestones in 2018 that we believe are important to the execution of our strategy. In May, we launched the latest version of our flagship home standby generator product line with Wi-Fi connectivity as a standard feature. As an industry first, we believe that the ability for a consumer or a dealer to remotely monitor a generator is a great first step towards enhancing the customer experience as well as enabling a deeper relationship with both end users and distribution partners. With this new functionality, we have also introduced the new software platform known as Fleet, specifically for our dealers that allows them to track the status of every single one of their customers' generators. By providing real-time information about the status of each machine as well as dramatically enhancing the level of diagnostic information available, we believe that dealers will be able to better track and schedule needed repairs or maintenance and we'll be able to do so with greater precision and speed with the outcome being to maximize the uptime of generators under their care. We also believe that the connectivity layers we are building and now deploying could have an important impact on other future opportunities by creating a gateway to the electrical system of a home or business. The market for certain services related to energy monitoring and management is rapidly developing, and we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in electronics and electrical systems, our broad distribution, our global footprint, and our brand to participate in this exciting new space. In 2018, we also expanded on our position as the largest global manufacturer of gaseous fuel backup generators with the introduction of a 750-kilowatt machine, the largest output unit in our lineup. We are very pleased with the initial acceptance of the product as interest has been strong since its release mid-year. The substitution of natural gas power gensets for traditional diesel fuel products has accelerated in recent years as the performance of newer gas machines equals or exceeds that of diesel generators while providing some tangible benefits for the end user by mitigating the need for fuel delivery, lower overall operating costs, and cleaner emissions. A core component of Generac strategy is to build on its leadership position in the market for natural gas gensets and throughout 2018. We introduced a number of new products, new programs, and innovative technologies related to gaseous generators during the year. 2018 was also a record year for sales volumes outside the U.S. and Canada for Generac with 22% of our overall revenues being generated primarily through our Pramac, Ottomotores, Tower Light, and Motortech entities. Building on our success in globalizing the company, we closed on the acquisition of a Mexican genset company Selmec in June of last year. Recall that Selmec is located in Mexico City and is a designer and manufacturer of commercial and industrial generators serving Latin America with a particular focus on the telecommunications market and strong service capabilities. The integration of Selmec with our existing Ottomotores operations is well under way with the latest milestone achieved earlier this month as we opened a new headquarters facility in Mexico City to consolidate our commercial and administrative teams into a single location. Further integration activities are planned for 2019, as we look to realize the synergies of combining the systems and production activities of the two businesses. In addition, in early 2019, Pramac acquired a majority share of Captiva Energy Solutions. Captiva founded in 2010 and headquartered in Calcutta, India, specializes in customized industrial generators. While relatively small in size, this acquisition gives us a physical presence in the important Indian backup power generation market and provides the platform to execute on the potential revenue and sourcing synergies that exist by integrating the Captiva operation into the broader Pramac business. Finally, I'd like to spend a minute this morning to tell you about some exciting enhancements we are making to our long-term strategy that we call Powering Ahead. Over the last 10 years, we have used Powering Ahead as our blueprint for making investments and prioritizing our resources. In that time, we've effectively more than tripled the revenues of Generac, while simultaneously quadrupling our served markets. As our business evolves from being a smaller more narrowly focused company to that of a larger globally focused leader in the power products industry, we believe that our strategy must also evolve. Last year you may recall that we added the strategic pillar of lead gas to Powering Ahead, as we believe that our continued leadership in gaseous fuel generator technology is a critical element of our future growth and focus. As we continue to think about other areas of our business and the markets that we serve that presents significant opportunities for us, we can see the connectivity in the technologies and markets associated with the Internet of Things will play a vital role in the way we interact with customers and distribution partners well into the future. The ability to connect will have a profound impact on the way we develop new products, the way we think about our customer service models, the opportunities to better monetize our products over their entire lifecycle and the exciting prospects around potentially creating entirely new business models around energy monitoring and energy management. As a result, we're adding a new pillar to our strategic plan simply called Connect and we are updating the name of our enterprise wide strategy to be called Powering Our Future. As we have done for the last 10 years, we intend to continue to prioritize our resources and our efforts around our strategic plan. With Powering Our Future, the four strategic objectives we have established of growing the residential generator market globally, gaining share in our existing markets, leading in gaseous generator technologies and using connectivity to develop new opportunities with our customers and distribution partners will guide our focus and investments for the future. I'd now like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on the fourth quarter results. York?
York Ragen: Thanks Aaron. Before discussing fourth quarter results in more detail, recall that effective January 1, 2018, Generac adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition accounting standard. For comparability purposes, the full retrospective method was elected under the standard which requires application to all periods presented. Although the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements, the prior year 2017 figures that we were discussing this morning have been adjusted accordingly. In addition upon finalizing our revenue recognition accounting under the new standard, we made certain immaterial prior quarter request vacations to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to extended warranties. There was no impact on income from operations or net income as a result of these prior quarter reclassifications. See our press release for more information related to these prior quarter reclassifications. Now looking at our fourth quarter 2018 results in more detail. Net sales for the quarter increased 14.3% to $563.4 million as compared to $493 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the $13.3 million of contribution from the June 1, 2018, Selmec acquisition and the slightly negative impact from foreign currency core growth rate during the quarter was approximately 12%. Looking at consolidated net sales by product class, residential product sales during the fourth quarter increased 10.3% to $293.9 million as compared to $266.6 million in the prior year quarter. Despite the fact that the prior quarter included the immediate after effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the current year quarters still experienced very strong growth in shipments of home standby generators as end market demand for these products continues to be robust. The elevated frequency and duration of power outages in recent years coupled with our initiatives to drive adoption of automatic home standby generators on an everyday basis has helped to make the category more mainstream in the marketplace resulting in record shipments of home standby generators during the current year fourth quarter. Switching to portable generators, the prior fourth quarter included the impact of Hurricane Maria and significant replenishment of portable generators with our retail partners on the back of the active hurricane season last year. As a result, shipments of portable generators while still strong were down in the current year fourth quarter versus prior year. Looking at our commercial industrial products, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 17.5% to $223.2 million as compared to $189.9 million in the prior year quarter with core growth being approximately 15% when excluding the M&A contribution from Selmec and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Domestically as Aaron mentioned we are seeing very strong growth in the telecom market as certain of our national telecom customers are in the middle of a large investment cycle for backup power equipment to harden their cell tower networks. In addition, demand for our mobile C&I products continues to be strong as our rental account customers both nationals and independents continue to replace their support equipment fleets for general rental and oil and gas purposes. Finally, shipments and order rates from our industrial distributors continue to be very strong during the current year quarter in particular for natural gas fuel generators as a strong economic environment and low natural gas prices are driving significant investment in non-residential construction and the adoption of natural gas as a cost effective fuel source for backup power. Internationally, our Pramac, Tower Light and Motortech businesses grew modestly during the quarter despite headwinds from the weakening euro as we continue to drive market penetration across the globe particularly in mainland Europe, Australia, Brazil and China. In Latin America, we also saw a modest shipment growth for the quarter even with certain geopolitical headwinds that are impacting that region. As we continue to make progress on the Ottomotores, Selmec integration and execute on synergies between the two companies. Net sales for the other products category primarily made up of service parts and extended warranty deferred revenue amortization increased 26.5% to $46.3 million as compared to $36.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 with core growth of approximately 13%. This strong core growth rate tracks with the rest of our business as the installed base of our products has expanded around the globe and replacement part demand increased due to the elevated power outage activity in recent quarters. Higher amortization of extended warranty deferred revenue also drove this increase. Gross profit margin was 36.3% compared to 37.1% in the prior year fourth quarter. A modestly favorable sales mix shift towards higher margin home standby generator sales and price increases implemented since prior year were more than offset by higher logistics and labor costs as well as the realization of unfavorable commodity and currency fluctuations relative to prior levels. Operating expenses increased $7.9 million or 9% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses excluding intangible amortization declined 30 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to improved operating leverage in the higher organic sales volumes. The increased operating expense dollars over the prior year was primarily driven by incremental variable OpEx on the strong sales volumes and increase in employee costs including long-term incentive compensation recorded during the current year quarter and additional recurring operating expenses from the Selmec acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower warranty and intangible amortization expenses. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company as defined in our earnings release was $123.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to $109.9 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin before deducting for non-controlling interests was 22.4% in the quarter as compared to 22.8% in the prior year. This 40 basis point decline compared to prior year was mostly due to the previously mentioned higher input costs that impacted gross margins offset by improved operating leverage on the organic increase in sales. For the full year 2018, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interests came in at $424.6 million resulting in a 21% margin and an impressive 34% increase over prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segments sales increased 14.3% to $437.8 million as compared to $382.9 million in the prior year quarter. As I previously discussed, strong broad base end market demand driven by higher power outages severity and favorable economic conditions drove increased shipments across our residential and C&I products in the current year fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter was $115.5 million or 26.4% of net sales as compared to $101.9 million in the prior year or 26.6% of net sales. For the full year 2018 domestic segment sales increased 21.2% over the prior year, while adjusted EBITDA margins increased 230 basis points. International segment sales increased 14% to $125.6 million as compared to $110.2 million in the prior quarter including $13.3 million of contributions from the Selmec acquisition and a foreign currency headwind of approximately 4%. Core sales growth was approximately 6% when you exclude both Selmec and currency impacts. As I previously discussed, this overall core growth compared to the prior year was due to broad based growth across our international subsidiaries as we continue to drive market penetration across the globe. Note that we were still able to execute relatively strong year-over-year core growth in the international segment despite the prior year benefiting from larger project activity across certain of Pramac's global sales branches. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment during the quarter before deducting for non-controlling interest was $10.6 million or 8.4% of net sales as compared to $10.5 million or 9.6% of net sales in the prior year. Higher margin larger project activity in the prior year quarter and higher input costs drove the year-over-year decline. For the full year 2018 international segment sales increased 17.9% over the prior year with core sales growth of approximate 13%. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests increased to 8.1% of net sales during 2018 compared to 7.2% of net sales in the prior year. We believe we are on track with our strategic plans to reach double-digit adjusted EBITDA margins for the international segment in the coming years. Now switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2018 on a consolidated basis. GAAP net income for the company for the quarter was $75.6 million as compared to $80.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The prior net income includes the impact of $28.4 million of non-cash gains largely from the reevaluation of the company's net deferred tax liabilities associated with the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. As a result, GAAP income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2017 were only $2 million. When excluding the aforementioned gain, GAAP income taxes in Q4 2017 would have been $30.4 million or an effective tax rate of 36.1% on an adjusted basis. This compares the GAAP income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2018 of $20 million or an effective tax rate of 20.7%. The large year-over-year decline in the GAAP tax rate on an adjusted basis is primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act which resulted in lower federal tax rates in the United States. In addition, a favorable return to provision adjustment was recorded in the current year fourth quarter related to the finalization of our 2017 federal and state income tax returns. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.20 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $1.29 in the prior year with the prior year earnings impacted by the aforementioned $28.4 million non-cash gain related to the Tax Reform Act or $0.45 per share. The specific calculations for these earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release. Adjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release was $88.1 million in the current year quarter or $1.42 per share versus $87.1 million in the prior year or $1.39 per share. The strong sales growth and related improvement in operating earnings just discussed were mostly offset by higher cash income taxes during the quarter. With regards to cash income taxes, the fourth quarter of 2018 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $15.4 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year quarter. The current year reflects a cash income tax rate of 15% for the full year 2018 with the prior year fourth quarter was based on a cash tax rate of 12.5% for the full year 2017. Higher pretax earnings in 2018 in excess of our tax yield coupled with the fact that 2017 benefited from certain incremental tax deductions that were accelerated into the 2017 tax returns resulted in a higher cash tax rate in 2018. Cash flow from operations was $108.2 million as compared to $136.7 million in the prior year fourth quarter and free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was $87.3 million as compared to $121.8 million in the same quarter last year. Higher operating earnings were more than offset by increased working capital investment due to the strong organic growth, incremental inventory purchases ahead of expected tariff changes and higher capital expenditure levels. Free cash flow for the full year 2018 was $204 million as compared to $228 million for 2017. During the current year quarter, we also made a voluntary $50 million payment on our ABL revolving credit facility paying off the entire outstanding balance as of December 31, 2018 with cash on hand. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $924 million of outstanding debt, net of unamortized, original issue discount and deferred financing costs. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.2x on an as reported basis a healthy decline for the 3.0x at the end of 2017. Given our strong earnings and cash flow generation, we have demonstrated the rapid deleveraging capabilities of the company. Additionally, at the end of the year, we had $224 million of cash on hand and there was approximately $277 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. Both our term loan and ABL now mature in the year 2023. Uses of cash during 2018 including $48 million for capital expenditures, $65 million for M&A, $24 million for the repayment of debt and approximate $26 million from stock repurchases. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our outlook for 2019.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you, York. As we have previously discussed this morning, end market demand for our products has continued to be strong as we enter 2019. As such we expect net sales in the first half of the year to grow approximately 10% to 12% on an as reported basis and 8% to 10% on a core basis with higher growth rates in the first quarter compared to the second quarter. This assumes an average baseline level of power outages during the period. Looking at the second half of 2019, net sales could range from low single-digit declines to low single-digit increases depending on the severity of power outages during the year. The low-end of the range would assume no major power outages and an average baseline outage environment while the high-end of the range would assume more elevated outage activity which could include a major power outage event during the year. Overall for the year, given these assumptions net sales are expected to increase between 3% to 7% compared to the prior year on an as reported basis and 2% to 6% on a core growth basis. Net income margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are expected to be between 11% to 12% for the full year 2019, with adjusted EBITDA margins also before deducting for non-controlling interest expected to be between 20% to 21% for the year. The low-end of the range would assume no major power outages and an average baseline outage environment and the high-end of the range would assume more elevated power outage conditions. Furthermore, mixed operating leverage and our level of promotion and marketing spend will all vary depending on the severity of power outages during the year. 2019 margins are also expected to be impacted by a number of other factors. Realization of higher input costs coming into the year along with the impact of regulatory tariffs are expected to be largely offset by price increases, favorable trends with respect to commodities, currencies and logistics costs and benefits from our profitability enhancement program throughout the year. Consistent with historical seasonality, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the second half of the year to be higher relative to the first half, with the sequential improvement being approximately 350 to 500 basis points depending on the power outage environment experienced during the year. This 2019 outlook does not reflect potential business acquisitions or stock buybacks given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we have significant resources to drive further shareholder value as we execute on our long-term strategic priorities. I'd now like to turn the call back over to York to walk through some additional guidance details for 2019. York?
York Ragen: Thanks Aaron. For 2019, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to increase to between 25% to 27% as compared to the 22.5% full year rate for 2018. Based on our guidance provided for 2019, our cash income tax expense for the year is expected to be approximately $50 million to $60 million depending on the outage environment which translates into an anticipated full year 2019 cash income tax rate of approximately 17% to 18%. That compares to the 15% cash income tax rate for full year 2018. The expected increase in our GAAP and cash tax rates compared to 2018 relates to certain favorable deductions that were accelerated and reflected in the 2018 rates in response to the Tax Reform Act that aren't expected to repeat in 2019. As a reminder, we still have a favorable tax shield as a result of a significant intangible amortization deduction in our corporate tax return that results in our cash income tax rate being notably lower than our GAAP income tax rate. With the passage of the Tax Reform Act, the tax affected annual value of this tax shield is expected to be approximately $30 million per year and expires fully in 2021. In 2019, we expect interest expense to be approximate $41 million to $42 million assuming no additional principal payments during the year and one expected rate increase in 2019. Our capital expenditures for 2019 reflect continued investments in expanding capacity and our forecast to be approximate 2.5% of our forecasted net sales for the year. Depreciation expense is forecast to be approximate $30 million in 2019 given our assumed CapEx guidance. GAAP intangible amortization expenses in 2019 is expected to be similar to 2018 levels at approximately $21 million to $22 million during the year. Stock compensation expense is also expected to be similar to 2018 at $14 million to $15 million per year. For full year 2019, operating a free cash flow generation is once again expected to be strong and follow historical seasonality benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow expected to be over 90% in 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks at this time. We'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Gilardi of Merrill Lynch. You may proceed with your question.
Ross Gilardi: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Ross.
Ross Gilardi: Hey, Aaron, I was wondering if you could kick it off just talking a little bit more about your balance sheet. I mean at the midpoint of your guidance for EBITDA and free cash flow, and I think your net debt to EBITDA is going to be like 1.1x by the end of '19, if you hit the numbers, I mean easily, I think the lowest since the IPO. So what's the plan, obviously, you had a lot of options like how you're thinking about dividends, buybacks, versus M&A?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I think Ross -- it's a great question and one that obviously internally as a company we -- given the position we're in and given the prospects for the company going forward there's -- we look at that and we say okay, how can we best create an environment for not only our future growth here at the company, but obviously for our shareholders and all stakeholders. And there's a – there’s a number of things you can do, and we step through our priority uses of cash every time. We've been very consistent even since the IPO on that. And the first thing we want to do is grow, continue to grow organically. And now thankfully, it doesn't take a tremendous amount of capital to do that, so we're pretty efficient that way. But that being said, we do have -- there's a number of CapEx things that we continue to look at in terms of scaling the company right through some capacity expansion, things that we're focused on this year, you'll notice the CapEx guide that we gave here this morning is a little bit higher than maybe historically we've been around the 2% of net sales this morning, closer to 2.5. And there's some capacity type of expansion things in there. You can imagine growing -- we grew 15% the year before, 20% last year. And when you do that, there's a lot of things that you need to do to get your capacity up. So that's one thing. Beyond that, we've said that there are some very interesting things to accelerate our strategy through acquisitions through M&A activity, and we've done 12 acquisitions over the last six or seven years, and we have a pipeline that would indicate that additional acquisition activity in the future is something that could happen if we find the right asset at the right price that fits our strategy, and we think it can accelerate things and help us grow. That's certainly something we're looking to. And there's the universe of potential acquisition targets for us, it is pretty big. There's a lot of things I think we could do there not only from an international standpoint where some of things have been focused like the Selmec acquisition last year and the Captiva acquisition announced early this year. But also, I think around some of these other potential business models and other opportunities we've been talking about as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. After you step through those things, then you start talking about return of capital to shareholders, and you can do that in a number of different ways, we've done some special dividends in the past. I think we've done some buybacks in the past, both of those are vehicles to do that. Paying down debt, I think we look at that and we've got a really cost effective liability structure. It doesn't mature until 2023. We really think we've got it. We wouldn't get a great return honestly from taking out a lot of debt. So we think putting the capital to work or returning it to shareholders is a better way to go, but we'll evaluate those priorities as we kind of have in the past and we'll have to figure out where we go from here. But I really like the setup. We've got a lot of -- we got a lot of dry powder here and we've got a lot of cool things that we're looking at that I'm pretty excited about.
Ross Gilardi: Okay. So you mentioned regular quarterly dividend. I mean does that still feel like something and you're not that interested in doing and that obviously [indiscernible] special in the past?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I would say that is about a quarterly dividend. I mean, it's something we've talked about and we've discussed dividends, and that's certainly one possibility. But I think at this stage, the way I think about the company as a growth company, the kind of growth we've experienced here. I think of regular dividend, I don't know that we're in the right part of the cycle yet to be thinking about that, and there are far too many opportunities for us to I think get a -- to continue to grow the company and get an overall longer term better return with investing – in whether again -- whether it's organic or whether it's through M&A activity. I just see too many potential areas where we can invest and use that capital for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. And so, I'm not ready to say that we don't have enough opportunities there, and I think that we've been -- we've been pretty clear on this point since our IPO. And maybe there's a point in the cycle where that's going to make sense, and we'll talk about that as a Board. But today, I'm just too excited about the future to say we should be thinking about deploying our capital that way versus through growth.
Ross Gilardi: Okay. Then [indiscernible] topic and I will hand it over. This Captiva transaction with Pramac, I mean can you talk a little bit more about the mechanics of that. And Aaron, you seem sort of interested in the Indian market for a long time and this gives you a foot in the door. I mean do you potentially use this to create a much bigger platform in a market like India or is this at this point we think of it as kind of exploratory or learn about the market and just sort of see what happens for the next three to five years?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's a great question, Ross. We kind of look at it as a -- giving us a toehold in a part of the world in India that we haven't really had any operations. We've done some sourcing there, but really no commercial activity. And it's a huge generator market. There's a couple of markets like that around the world where we think we need to participate. And we could've went in, could have kind of pushed all the chips into the middle and gone all in with a much larger acquisition if we wanted to go that route. But, I think given our limited knowledge of the market, we felt it better to try this first and if it works, I think it could be a springboard for something bigger. I think we're looking at it from this standpoint. There's -- as we've been talking in our prepared remarks this morning, the substitution of natural gas generators for diesel gensets is something that's been going on for the last 20 or 30 years here in the United States. We're starting to see that pattern repeat in other parts of the world. India eventually will do that as well. The economics of natural gas infrastructure and the usage of natural gas for heating and cooking and other base load power needs and things of that nature. The economic arguments are far too compelling in favor of natural gas. It got lower emissions profiles and many of the fuels that are burned in many other parts of the world. And we're going to need natural gas for a long time for base load power production everywhere in the world. India is starting to realize this and they've got a lot of projects on the drawing board for natural gas pipeline infrastructure. As that infrastructure gets deployed, the opportunity to connect a backup power system like a generator to that pipeline becomes a reality. And we think that being there and having a footprint in India to begin to push on that is an important part of our overall lead gas strategic pillar. And so that's really where we want to start out in India, it could be bigger for us long-term. But I think it's a way for us to cut our teeth there.
Ross Gilardi: Got it. Thanks very much.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Charlie Brady of SunTrust Robinson. You may proceed with your question.
Charlie Brady: Hey thanks. Good morning guys. I was wondering -- obviously, on the M&A, this new - the Powering Our Future and [indiscernible] time adding in there. I'm wondering does that add sort of an additional pipeline to M&A. And can you maybe talk about what would be potential ideas of you branching out beyond, when you rack into that area.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's a great question, Charlie. Any time we've only made a few adjustments to strategy over the last 10 years. And any time you do that you have to evaluate, again we use M&A to help us accelerate our strategy. So I think we've been very consistent on that point. And as we add this new pillar of connect to our strategy and kind of rebranding the strategy, Powering Our Future. Absolutely, the M&A funnel now is starting to fill up with different ideas. Some of them technology oriented. Some of them, when you talk about other kind of monitoring type of opportunities it's actually for our business development teams, your corporate development teams, it's been interesting because we find that we've had to kind of interface with different parties and different people than we've been traditionally doing in the kind of -- I'll call it traditional equipment spaces, right. So many of these business models are more around services, the business models can be -- vary as I've mentioned for technology oriented, we're not ready to discuss details about the pipeline itself. But I think what you're going to see from us over the next several years is interesting and again this is what -- I've been here a long time, 25 years and I can't remember a time I've been more excited about the future of the company and what's going on in the industry. I think the utilities, the energy markets, there is going to be a tremendous amount of change coming in the next decade. The next 10 years is going to present just some amazing changes to all of that. And we think we should have an opportunity to participate in how that market develops. I don't know that anybody knows exactly how it's going to develop or what's going to happen, but people have ideas. I think that the traditional model of delivering power by utility to your home or your business. I think that's going to change radically here in the next few years and whether that's because of the addition of renewables or storage or decentralization of the grid, onsite power generation, distributed generation. There's a lot of different formats that this is going to take. But I think that the focus that we have on natural gas gensets and the focus that we're now putting on connectivity. I think a really important parts of putting ourselves in the middle of many of those conversations down the line.
Charlie Brady: Great. I don't know if I missed it. But can you talk about the Florida Nursing Home Assisted Living Facility situation that's going on there providing the generators; is that bleeding into 2019 as you kind of alluded to in prior calls?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. There was about a third of the facilities in Florida that were granted waivers for the end of the year deadline to get a backup power system in place. And so that will undoubtedly lead to some spill over here into 2019, the first half most likely. And each of those waiver is a little different depending on the situation, the size of the facility. But, it's been a nice -- Florida has been a great market as you can imagine not only for the residential markets that we serve, but also in the C&I space and not just for healthcare. I mean we've seen a marked increase in a number of other kind of commercial and industrial type applications for backup power there as you know it was a state that went what 10, 11 years without any kind of major disruptions in the grid there. And then, we've had a number of different things happen in the last few years. So it's back on the radar screen. Florida is doing well and there will be some spillover I don't think it's going be -- it's not going to be major. But our guidance does contemplate some amount of spillover.
Charlie Brady: All right. Thanks. Just one more for me. On the price cost, you talked about I guess neutralizing that, but I'm just trying to get a little more color on -- can you put through price increases, obviously particularly on the home standby market development pricing is a sensitive issue to that whole dynamic of the growth there. Are you going to be fully neutral for the year and is a ramp or are you fully neutral now today? Thanks.
York Ragen: Charlie, this is York. So, yes, I think there are input costs headwinds and it's not just tariffs. The realization of just higher steel costs and aluminum and copper and logistics costs have really spiked up in Q4, labor costs. The realization of all tariffs costs are going to spill into the front half of 2019. So, you're probably going to have some headwinds on the price cost side in the front half of 2019. But, what we see though is today as those input costs are starting to moderate, if you look at steel, copper, aluminum and if you look at our currencies with the euro and the RMB. And then, logistics costs we see moderating. And then, you layer on the price increases relative to the tariff situation. And then, also combine that with all of these profitability enhancement initiatives that we have collectively. We think that's going to flip around in the back half of '19 to neutralize that fully for the full year. So we are cognizant of the price increase side of -- relative to home standby and price elasticity. But I think with relative to tariffs, it's just something that the market will bear, should the tariffs come to fruition or at least at the 25% level on March 1.
Charlie Brady: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.
Jerry Revich: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Jerry, good morning.
Jerry Revich: You folks have really focused on the analytics and one interesting element that I'm wondering if you could talk about is, if you're starting to see in your residential standby business, any replacement demand of units that were installed 15 to 20 years ago just to give us a sense for what the replacement market could look like once we get to the sweet spot of the units that were installed, then I call it mid 2000s plus when the business really started to ramp for you. Any analytics that you can share with us in terms of the contribution from replacement or the ramp in replacement at all for that business would be helpful?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Jerry it's a -- we've been talking about it much because the market's only 20, 25 years old. And it is interesting and we do track all that information. And it's a very reliable steady march up in terms of the percentage of products that we sell today that go into a replacement as a replacement. And so today we're sitting at about 5%, 6% of our volume there on the residential side is for replacement. But I think you may have hit an interesting nail on the head there, which is there are because of the nature of the way that market is grown, there's faster points in the penetration curve that happened over the last 10 to 20 years. And when you hit one of those patches and you hit that kind of replacement cycle, you should see this, similar kind of offset increase in the replacement cycle in terms of that growth and we're seeing that. So as an example, with Florida, again, it was 10, 11 years ago, but there was -- prior to that there were some pretty interesting up cycles around Katrina back in 2005. You had the big power outages in the Northeast in 2003. We're starting to get into those kind of timeframes. Generators should last you between 15 to 20 years, if well cared for. It's typical -- like a typical piece of your home's infrastructure like an HVAC system something like that, very similar. But we do see that it's starting to show up and we're kind of excited about that long-term because as we build this market out now, we've got our installed bases is well over 1.5 million machines actually getting closer to 2 million here and there's a nice opportunity there, longer term for replacement.
Jerry Revich: Appreciate the disclosures. You mentioned really the 6000 dealer network now. Can you just talk about your efforts to continue to drive high engagement in some of the newer dealers where after the post-storm enthusiasm might potentially fade as you laid out, call it into the back half of '19? What are you folks doing to drive continued engagement to make sure those 6000 dealers some of the newer ones stay green for you?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's a challenge every time, right, because you had dealers. They generally come on board. As the market is -- market demand cycle is higher. And then, when demand relaxes you've got to effectively train the dealers on how to market. And many of these dealers are in the electrical trades or HVAC trades and marketing maybe for an electrician doesn't come as kind of a standard part of your business practices, right. So it's a new skill set that has to be learned. And we have a progression for dealers. We do a lot of training. I think one of the things that is just an amazing part of this business and I don't know that whether it's investors or others that maybe don't get it is that distribution that we've built that 6000 dealers we've built that over 20 years. And we have poured countless dollars, time, blood, sweat and tears into building that out and to making these dealers our representatives out in the market for a new product categories like home standby generators. And that just takes -- we burn a lot of calories. It's an ongoing effort. You can't relax at all. You have to constantly be coming up with new programs. I would say that one element of that we talked about this in our prepared remarks, but with our connectivity initiatives now this new platform that we're introducing called Fleet. It's a software platform that our team has been working on here. We just rolled that out. We had our annual dealer conference a couple of weeks ago in Las Vegas, 2,500 people there. It was a massive event. And we talk about new programs, Fleet being one of them. But Fleet is, you can kind of think of that as -- obviously by its name, you can see all of the generators under a dealer's care right, there, their customers products. But and they can get a lot of diagnostic information things like that. But the way we think about Fleet longer term is a really important way to engage with dealers. It could potentially be a totally different platform, many of these dealers; their "ERP" system is a spiral notebook on the dashboard of their van or truck. And you could think of Fleet as being a potential platform for dispatch, for billing, for other things that we could -- inventory control things of that nature. We see it as a really interesting way to interact with our dealers on a go forward basis. So it's things like that that help us keep the engagement up even after the initial surge of excitement and demand passes after an event.
Jerry Revich: Thank you. I appreciate the discussion.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Jerry.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Hammond: Hey, good morning guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Jeff.
York Ragen: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond: So just on the 2% to 6% core, is there any way to parse it out between commercial and residential?
York Ragen: Yes. The 2% to 6% core is collective. So, on the C&I business I think our prepared remarks talked about the strong end market demand we're seeing both domestically and internationally there's a number of verticals that are turned on. And we see those continuing that strong demand into 2019 and pretty consistent throughout the year. So for C&I purposes, we're seeing that that high single-digit, low double-digit growth really consistently throughout the year. At least that's our -- what our guide shows. And it's really consistent across domestic and international. So I think that the theme there is broad based, strong demand for C&I. On the resi side, what that would mean is probably flat to down slightly, but down slightly is mainly due to headwinds with regards to portables. So still seeing resi flat to slightly down with portables being the headwind there for the full year.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then, does that inform some of the margin dynamic where commercial would be lower mix?
York Ragen: Yes. So if you look at -- I talked a little bit about price costs on the mix side, that probably be -- there would be a slight negative mix hit on the margin side relative to -- from '18 to '19.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. And then, last question, inventories moved up quite a bit and was a big drag on working capital. Can you just speak to how much of that is, some of this pre-buy ahead of tariffs, what is your finish good inventory look like? And then, just separately how are you feeling about channel inventories? Thanks.
York Ragen: Yes. I mean the way I think about inventory levels because they did increase during the year. So when you think about portable generators. So last year at this time, we had just lived through hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, our inventory, portable inventory level was wiped out there. So throughout 2018 here, we've actually been investing in replenishment in our warehouses of our portable inventory levels. So just sort of everyday portable replenishment thing with that way. On the tariff side, so we saw -- as we were ending the year, there was the threat of tariffs going to 25% -- from 10% to 25% relative to Chinese imported goods on January 1. So as a management team, we said look, it would be smart to bring in some extra components across the board, across our product lines at least those impacted by that could be impacted by those tariffs. And we decided to invest in pre-buy of that inventory prior to that potential tariff change. And then, the third piece of the puzzle is, really just our strong 20% growth. We're going to be in just investing in more inventory to facilitate our growth. So I think that may one-third, one-third, one-third, when you think of those categories that are driving that inventory increase. On the field inventory side, on the portable side, I think -- book field inventory stock ready to go, ready for a storm, on the home standby side, I think it's actually seasonally appropriate, seasonally consistent with where we should be very manageable where we're at this point of the curve coming into 2019. So what we're feeling okay on where our field inventories are for home standby.
Jeff Hammond: Okay. Thanks guys.
York Ragen: Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Baird. You may proceed with your question.
Mike Halloran: Hey. Good morning guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Mike.
York Ragen: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Halloran: So first just clarifying on the guidance to make sure, I'm thinking about it right in terms of assumptions on outage activity. I think about the first half, it feels like you're essentially saying momentum from the back half of '18 plus an average underlying outage environment. And then, when you think about the back half of the year, it's an average underlying environment. And then, the range of outcomes is based on nominal larger opportunities versus the high-end being more significant opportunities. Is that how you guys are breaking that out front to back?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. That's exactly it, Mike.
Mike Halloran: Okay. Perfect. And then, regional variances obviously you said Southeast, Northeast are doing very well on the areas that aren't seeing as much impact from the larger scale things over the last couple of years. Maybe track how awareness in those areas and what growth looks like dealer distribution penetration and things like that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So I mean, it is interesting because you see those oscillation that will happen where you get events like we had down in the southeast and we had the nor'easters that were in the beginning of 2018 or in March 2018 consecutive nor'easters that have been, I think kind of turning the Northeast to -- has been. If you think of the U.S. as a heat map, it's actually very interesting. We watch just even all the way down to individual states, but even actually more granular than that of course. But, it is interesting that the Midwest was a really good market for us a year ago and this year, there were quite a few storms and events in Michigan, in Ohio, Illinois and that didn't repeat this year to the same level and so that cooled off, as an example. But, it is interesting because what's going through like -- if you look at it right now today there's actually been quite a bit more activity out West. So the West and the Northwest, the recency of a lot of the storms that are going on out there, I was just looking at outages this morning we tracked them everywhere and there was 130,000 people in California without power this morning from the latest event that was rolling through. And so that's just one state, one area and very predictably and we now have this, you can imagine from a data perspective we have a fair amount of data and there's a fair level of predictability around some of this that we could say reliably net -- at this point over the next 12 months in California, we're going to have, it's going to be -- it's going to be the growth rate will be better than it's been. Same will happen in the northwest as well. So but it's -- it does, it does move in. Puerto Rico was really hot couple of years ago. Now, it's not. I mean there's -- it really does cycle and oscillate, but it's interesting that that being said, they grow -- this is a step function growth that we've talked about. You get to this baseline level of growth you kind of grow rapidly, and then, it tops out at a kind of baseline level or bottoms out, if you want to call it that. And then it stays there but it's materially higher than where it was prior to the event. And then, you get another event successively after that and it grows again. And so it's really quite amazing mathematically speaking how you can start to model that out.
Mike Halloran: No. It makes sense. And then, I know it's early days, just customer and dealer receptivity to the connectivity solutions you're putting it out there. And then, thoughts on that resi versus the C&I side and how implementation could phase variably between the two areas?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Now, it's a good question. Right now a good chunk of our focus has been on the residential side. So I'll start there. Our receptivity has been good. We have a -- the challenge in that, if there's a challenge is like anything we roll out to our distribution partners, there's an adoption rate, right. They have to adopt that. There's a learning curve. It's not like anything else in life that are unlike anything else in life it's the same. And again, we're talking about mainly electrical contractors here. They're not used to working with customers with their Wi-Fi networks and passwords. And so there's been a bit of learning that's going on there. There's a lot of learning cycles run in the market. But we have tens of thousands of units connected already in a very short period of time. And the data that it's giving us is amazing. It's great. The interaction level the way we're able to increase the interaction with our customers. We can look at customers; products. We can understand what's going on. We can now -- this is a really cool thing. We can deliver over the air firmware updates to our machines. So as new features get developed in the products we can deliver those features to customers. So there's additional future benefit potential coming from that. It also then leads right into that Fleet comment I made previously. It allows for our dealers to have a much better view of all of the products under their care to effect repairs a lot quicker and more accurately. And that's been a really good upside. The C&I piece is the next piece for us. And we've got our control platforms there. We've introduced a brand new control platform on our industrial products that are -- that's going to roll into products here over the next 12 to 24 months as we kind of cycle through it. It's a lot of product to get the new platform in. We call it our Power Zone Control platform, but it's state-of-the-art. And it's by far and away the coolest generator controlled platform in the industry and it was all developed internally. And again, this is I think one of the great benefits of the focus we bring to the market is we do a lot of this stuff internally. And it's the same with the remote monitoring; we're doing it all internally. We're not leaving that to some other third party. We feel that as the OEM we want to have that direct conversation with our customers and our distribution partners.
Mike Halloran: Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Mike.
York Ragen: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chip Moore of Canaccord. You may proceed with your question.
Chip Moore: Thanks. Hey, guys.
York Ragen: Hi, Chip.
Chip Moore: On the 8% to 10% core in the first half. Can you talk a bit more on visibility I think you said it was more Q1 weighted, so some of the puts and takes there? And then, maybe just remind us on baseline outage activity expectations. Does events of the past couple years is that push that up or are you thinking, how do we think about that? Thanks.
York Ragen: Yes. I think our prepared remarks that the assumption there at least for the first half is that we're assuming just sort of long-term average levels which if you -- actually if you do the math that would actually be lower than what we experienced in 2018. So that 8% to 10% core growth that we were talking about in the first half it actually, it spreads across resi and C&I relatively consistently so we're seeing strength both in resi and C&I as I mentioned. And then, as we said in the prepared remarks, Q1 given the strength that we're seeing coming into the year, we expect those Q1 growth rates to be higher than the second quarter. So I think that was the level of commentary we were providing on that.
Chip Moore: Got it. That's helpful. York thanks. And good to hear you talking a lot more on this new connect strategy obviously it's a robust ecosystem a lot of things you could go after. Can you talk about your appetite for partnerships and the organic development versus the M&A which you can clearly use to accelerate it? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's a great question. I think that, again, I think about my time here at the company and just all the things that we've done over the years. And I don't think I'd be more excited about a potential area of growth in a way for us to really explore some of the great things that we've done here in terms of distribution I talked about that before, the build out of distribution, our brand, and the position we got in the marketplace. And take that in concert with our technical expertise around electrical systems and this unique opportunity we have -- every one of our machines, these backup generators is connected to a home or businesses electrical panel in their electrical system. There are very few companies that can probably claim that space other than the panel manufacturers themselves and certainly they do claim that space. But I think that the opportunity there to do something with that and our distribution and our brand and this connectivity layer is really exciting. So to your question about organic versus M&A. M&A certainly can help us do some of those things faster and there may be some technical skill sets and the people in particular that we might need to be successful in that could come to us through M&A. But make note -- make no mistake, we're putting a lot of effort organically with the current system that we've rolled out. The Fleet system, the Wi-Fi connectivity systems that act as this gateway that was all built internally. We didn't partner. We have a team of people here in Waukesha, Wisconsin. We're doubling the size of that team this year. And it's not a small team. It's a big team and we're going to double that because we believe in the future of this being a really critical part of the future and moving Generac into more of a -- I'll call it more of a solutions based provider as opposed to just a products based company, more around services. The subscription models like we're already selling through our mobile link subscription which is a monitoring subscription for generators. The amount of potential business models and things that we could do with this are just -- they're almost -- where we've got too many things, we have to prioritize what exactly we want to go after and how we want to do it. But we're going to be in the middle of that conversation and I think it's going to have a profound impact on this company over the next decade.
Chip Moore: That's great. Thanks a lot Aaron.
York Ragen: Thanks Chip.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Drab of William Blair. You may proceed with your question.
York Ragen: Nobody home?
Aaron Jagdfeld: We lost him.
York Ragen: Maybe on mute.
Brian Drab: That's my bad, my bad. Good morning.
York Ragen: He was on mute. Very good. Hey, Brian, how are you doing?
Brian Drab: I was wondering why you didn't say good morning back, usually they say good morning back. Sorry. So can we just zoom back out and can you talk about -- did something change in terms of how you were viewing the first half of '19, where we stand today versus where we were at the -- on the third quarter call? Do you feel a little -- if they've seen more demand then you would have expected in the first half slightly. And what are the -- can you kind of rank order the factors that drove that storm activity recently et cetera.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Brian. I think for sure that as we get to another 90 days plus away from that third quarter call and that has galvanized our view on the first half because we're closer to it and in fact we're almost two months into it here and we came into the year feeling good about 2019. It's playing out at this point as you indicate maybe even a little bit stronger. And I think our guidance reflects that. And over what we were kind of maybe talking about on the third quarter even though we weren't really giving full year guidance, I think we said the next -- we felt pretty good about the next three to six months for sure and that definitely is how we feel about this. And I think maybe more importantly what we really like is, what we're seeing in the C&I space. C&I markets for us have been -- have remained strong both stationary and mobile. Some of our large accounts in the rental markets, some of our large accounts in the telecom market, we've got some customer concentration, the buying signals there and the -- there are kind of plans as they roll them out for the full year. And some of these companies are public companies really kind of fit well with how we were thinking about the year playing out. And so we're pleased to see that CapEx spending for these customers is going to continue the hardening of their networks, if it's a telecom customer is going to continue. And the overall C&I business has just been -- it's felt very strong. And I think that our guidance reflects how we're feeling about that. And then, resi of course as we said activations were just at amazing levels in Q4. And what we look at in that particular business we look at the leading indicators, we call them IHCs, in-home consultations. In-home consultations have been up dramatically over the prior year's run rate in the first 45 days of the year here. So we're very excited about that because we think that that portends to a stronger, again, it's all reflected in the guidance, but it portends to a pretty good first half.
Brian Drab: Got it. You mentioned telecom in there too. Have you seen any signs of a pause there's some companies that supply into that market, have said they've seen a pause, someone obviously AT&T is having some issues and some other issues going on in the industry?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. It's certainly customer specific, I think, the ones that where you're hearing pauses and seeing pauses. And I think that -- in that, it is interesting how that tends to rotate from one customer to another for us. One year might be one customer is doing a lot of build out in a network and maybe another customer that was doing a lot of build out the year before has pulled back, for whatever reason. Sometimes it's M&A on their part. Sometimes there are other business factors or economic factors that drive that. But we have -- I think we feel pretty good about remaining at some of the same levels that we saw in 2018 as it relates to telecom. And it was strong in 2018. Nothing at this point gives us pause now that can change as we said before, but I think that the realization from all of these providers that the uptime of their networks is just absolutely critical right. I mean most people are paying now by the bit and the byte that goes across those networks. And so if the network is down, it's not just an inconvenience for customers. There's an economic impact to the carrier as well. And then, you couple that with just the critical nature of the communications and things that are going on across these networks, it has become a vital part of our infrastructure as a country. And we're also seeing that around the world. I mean we've got some great things from a telecom perspective going on in Brazil. We've got some great things going on in Mexico. We've got some really interesting possibilities going on in mainland Europe around telecom. And we see the opportunity to take our expertise here in the U.S. and telecom and extend that based on our expanded geographical footprint through all these acquisitions. That was always part of the original strategy and we're starting to see some of that come to fruition.
Brian Drab: Thanks. And the last one for me is, just -- how far away are we from seeing maybe a certain to see a material impact from the implementation of your strategy with Motortech and getting more into continuous power and some of these things that you laid out at the Analyst Day? And are you seeing that now or is that still coming?
Aaron Jagdfeld: We're actually starting to see some of that, Brian. We have, in fact, we have a dedicated commercial resources here now at the company that are focused on building that market out alongside Motortech and alongside some of our partners in the rest of the world markets where you will see more of those applications frankly. But it is really interesting because we're seeing some really neat opportunities even in places like Canada, time of use programs from utility providers are taking natural gas generators -- customers are taking natural gas generators and using them where they would have normally had a backup system anyway. They're using that generator to reduce their utility bills. And this is some of the things that we talked about at our Investor Day, 1.5 years ago and we see that market developing. But as we said at that Investor Day, that's a long play, right. We know that it's going to take time to build out an important part of our future success there is continue to roll our products and programs and the support structures needed to be successful in that market. We also have to grow our brand in other parts of the world where we're quite well known here in the U.S. market and maybe in Latin America as well. But maybe not so much in other places in China or India or the African continent or even the European continent. So, we've got some brand building to do, some awareness to do. But we like the prospects for that long-term and it will be long-term but we're seeing some really interesting things starting out some really good interest around that.
Brian Drab: So is it more an international opportunity than it is a U.S. opportunity?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think initially that's probably right. I think it's -- the U.S. power markets as they evolve those opportunities will become more evident here as well. But I think they will become more evident in other parts of the world quicker. There is a lot of factors that drive that some of it is stability of grid where you have, again, like in India where you have a lot of outrage events and a natural gas generator because when you have a lot of outage events and a generator is going to run a lot or if you're talking 8 to 10 hours a day, the input costs meaning the fuel matters and natural gas costs are roughly half the cost of diesel fuel. And so that really adds into the total return of the machine and the way that a customer would view that and that has a stronger payback our ROI outside the U.S. today than it does inside the U.S. That may change as the energy markets develop here. But, again, over the long haul, but as we go out the gas market even further, but that's kind of how we think it's going to play out.
Brian Drab: Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You bet. Thanks Brian.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would not like to turn the call back over to Aaron Jagdfeld for any further remarks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks operator. We want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to reporting on our first quarter 2019 earnings results, which we anticipate will be at some point in early May. With that, we'll leave you here today. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all just disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-11-01 09:00:00) =====
Executives: York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc. Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.
Analysts: Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 Generac Holdings, Incorporated Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at the time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin your conference.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer. We'll begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter results came in ahead of our expectations and represent the best quarter in our history. Continue broad-based strength in all of our end markets, coupled with additional residential product shipments due to Hurricane Florence, were important drivers for the quarter. Year-over-year, overall sales increased 23% with core organic growth of approximately 20% when excluding the impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. Gross margins improved by 110 basis points and EBITDA margins improved approximately 280 basis points, with the increase in sales allowing us to once again demonstrate the earnings power of Generac. Shipments of residential products were at record levels with demand reaching new highs as increased power outages across the country continue to demonstrate the importance of having a backup generator. Commercial and industrial or C&I product shipments were also higher in the current year quarter, with both stationary and mobile products experiencing strong growth. Additionally, order rates for stationary C&I products were significantly higher than prior year as businesses are also concluding that a backup power system is an important component of mitigating the risk of disruption to the operations that a power outage can cause. Those higher orders are expected to convert to shipments in the quarters ahead as we enter the fourth quarter with a record backlog for these products. Interest in home standby generators in particular remains strong, very strong during the quarter, with elevated levels of in-home consultations or IHCs. Activations during the third quarter were also at an all-time high as the more robust power outage environment in the last several quarters has led to a dramatic increase in awareness of the product category. Given these strong end market conditions and when combined with lower levels of home standby field inventories, we would expect year-over-year growth for residential products to continue in the quarters ahead. In addition, recall that in the second quarter, we launched our 2018 model year home standby product line, which included WiFi-enabled connectivity as a standard feature. Although it's early, we are very encouraged by how quickly the number of connected generators has ramped. This is an important part of our strategy as we look to expand this platform to enable new areas of engagement with our customers and with our dealers. Additionally, portable generator shipments in the quarter were also very strong once again due to storm-related outages. Over the last 12 months, we have had great success in winning incremental placement with our retail channel partners for this category. We believe this is the direct result of our ability to quickly react to surges and demand for residential products and services when a major event occurs. We have an incredible team here that executes with an enormous sense of urgency and purpose when events like Hurricanes Irma and Florence caused power outages. Internally, there's an all-hands-on-deck approach to manning phones, shipping critical parts, and even building product. It's something that is truly unique to Generac, and I'm incredibly proud of our efforts to help people when they are literally and figuratively at their darkest hour. C&I product demand also outpaced expectations in the third quarter with shipments of domestic mobile products stronger again this quarter as the rebound that began last year continued. National rental companies have largely driven the recovery to date as they have refreshed their fleets. But we are now starting to see signs of independent and specialty rental companies are beginning to do the same. As we exit 2018, we believe higher energy prices and increased focused on infrastructure related projects will further underpin the continued interest in mobile products. Quotation activity and new orders for stationary C&I products in North America were also very strong during the quarter. Given this increased demand, lead times for many of these products began to lengthen due to tight availability of components and labor. Backlog for C&I stationary gensets entering the fourth quarter is at record levels, which should translate into healthy growth in the quarters ahead. Demand for generators used in telecom applications was particularly strong as wireless carriers further invested in the stability of their networks. Heightened outage activity continues to demonstrate the need for backup power for this important part of our infrastructure. During major events, the ability to communicate via voice and data becomes even more critical as the traffic on these networks is often from first responders and those that are in need of help. Also, during the quarter, activity associated with the State of Florida's legislation requiring that nursing homes and assisted living facilities have sufficient backup power had a positive impact across our distribution channels. We believe the resulting demand from this mandate will likely roll over into 2019 due to the lengthy permitting process and challenging labor environment which are both contributing to extend the typical project cycle associated with these types of applications. Internationally, we continue to see growth despite the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In particular, we experienced growth in our existing Pramac locations in Europe, Brazil and China, as well as our newest location in Australia. Recall that only earlier this year, we opened a branch office in Australia, and we have been very pleased with the receptivity to the Pramac stationary and Generac mobile product lines that we are currently selling there. We also recently expanded the operations in Australia to include Generac branded residential products. And although early, we believe the opportunity exists to deploy our demand creation and sales tools for home standby generators in a market that has many of the same fundamentals and characteristics as those that exist in the U.S. We have worked very hard over the past few years to more fully integrate our international acquisitions, and we've been very pleased with the synergies we have been seeing. With the recent acquisition of Selmec in Mexico, we believe we can quickly integrate this business within our existing Latin American operations to create a clear leader for backup power and services in this important region. I now would like to turn the call back over to York to provide further details on our third quarter results. York?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Aaron. Before discussing third quarter results in more detail, recall that effective January 1, 2018, Generac adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition accounting standard. For comparability purposes, the full retrospective method was elected under the standard, which requires application to all periods presented. Although the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements, the prior year 2017 figures that we are discussing this morning have been adjusted accordingly. Now, looking at our third quarter results in more detail, net sales for the quarter increased 22.7% to $559.5 million as compared to $455.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, including $13.4 million of contribution from the June 1, 2018, Selmec acquisition. Core sales growth, which excludes the impact of both acquisitions and foreign currency, was approximately 20% over the prior year. Foreign currency had an approximate 1% unfavorable impact to net sales during the current year third quarter, mainly due to the weakening of the euro relative to prior year. Looking at consolidated net sales by product class, residential product sales during the third quarter increased 24% to $311.9 million as compared to $251.2 million in the prior year quarter. As Aaron mentioned, the current year quarter experienced incredibly strong growth in shipments of home standby generators as end market demand for these products continue to be robust. Given the elevated frequency and duration of power outages over the last couple of years, we are seeing very strong demand for our home standby generator products, helping to drive penetration of the product category as it becomes more mainstream in the marketplace. In addition, our efforts to drive awareness, availability, affordability, and connectivity for automatic home standby generators has helped to drive adoption of the category on an everyday basis. Recall that last year's third quarter included hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. The impact from those events was significant for our portable generator products as we shipped a large amount of product into the impacted regions to address the immediate need for backup power. As a result, shipments of portable generators, while still strong, were down modestly in the current year third quarter versus the prior year given this tough comparison. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales for the third quarter of 2018 increased 18.7% to $206.4 million as compared to $173.8 million in the prior year quarter with core sales growth being approximately 15%. Domestically, the telecom and healthcare verticals continued to show signs of strength during the quarter. In addition, demand for our mobile C&I products remained strong as our national rental account customers continued the replacement cycle for their fleets. Finally, order rate from our industrial distributors was very strong during the current year quarter, in particular for natural gas fueled generators as the strong economic environment is driving significant investment in non-residential construction. Internationally, our Pramac, Tower Light, and Motortech businesses grew modestly despite some foreign currency headwinds as we continue to drive market penetration across the globe. In Latin America, we continued to make progress on the Ottomotores and Selmec integration as we combine our product offerings and commercial organizations to execute on synergies between the two businesses. However, despite this progress, the tough prior year comparison with Hurricane Maria impacted year-over-year growth rates in Latin America. Net sales for the other products category, primarily comprised of service parts, increased 34% to $41.2 million as compared to $30.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, with core growth of approximately 21%. This strong core growth rate tracks with the rest of our business as the installed base of our products has expanded around the globe and replacement part demand increased due to the elevated power outage activity during the quarter. Gross profit margin expanded 110 basis points to 35.4% compared to 34.3% in the prior year third quarter. A significant favorable mix shift towards higher margin home standby generator sales primarily drove this increase. Price cost factors were largely neutral to gross margins during the quarter relative to the prior year as a more favorable pricing environment and improved manufacturing overhead absorption helped to offset general inflationary pressures. Operating expenses increased $7.7 million or 9.2% as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses, excluding intangible amortization, declined 150 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to improved operating leverage on the significantly higher organic sales volumes. The increase in operating expense dollars was primarily driven by higher employee and incentive compensation costs, incremental variable OpEx on the higher sales volumes, as well as additional recurring operating expenses from the Selmec acquisition. These items were partially offset by lower promotion and marketing costs given the more favorable demand environment, as well as lower intangible amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $123 million in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to $87.3 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin before deducting for non-controlling interest was 22.2% in the quarter as compared to 19.4% in the prior year. This 280-basis-point increase compared to the prior year was largely due to the previously mentioned favorable sales mix and improved operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA dollars on a last 12 months basis before deducting for non-controlling interests were $411 million or 21.2% of LTM net sales. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 25% to $453.3 million as compared to $362.9 million in the prior year quarter. As I previously discussed, this very strong organic growth was a result of higher power outage severity and a more favorable economic environment, which drove increased demand for home standby generators, C&I mobile and stationary products, as well as service parts compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $117.1 million or 25.8% of net sales as compared to $82.8 million in the prior year or 22.8% of net sales. International segment sales increased 14.3% to $106.3 million as compared to $92.9 million in the prior year quarter, including $13.4 million of contribution from the Selmec acquisition and an approximate 3% foreign currency headwind. Core sales growth was approximately 3% when you exclude both Selmec and currency impacts. As we continue to grow the international segment, adjusted EBITDA before deducting for non-controlling interest improved to $7.4 million or 6.9% of net sales as compared to $5.6 million or 6.1% of net sales in the prior year. Now switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2018 on a consolidated basis, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $75.8 million as compared to $39.4 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in operating earnings previously discussed together with the lower GAAP tax rate contributed to this increase in GAAP net income. GAAP income taxes during the third quarter of 2018 were $20.1 million or an effective tax rate of 20.8% as compared to $20.4 million or 33.9% for the prior year. The large year-over-year decline in the GAAP tax rate is primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, which became effective in December 2017. In addition, a favorable provision to return adjustment was recorded in the current year third quarter related to the finalization of our 2017 federal income tax return. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.11 in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.63 in the prior year. The specific calculations for these earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release. Note that current quarter GAAP earnings per share were impacted by a $6.9 million adjustment to increase the value of the redeemable non-controlling interest for the Pramac acquisition, resulting in $0.11 reduction in GAAP earnings per share. Under U.S. GAAP accounting rules, any adjustments to this redemption value are recorded directly to retain earnings. However, the redemption value adjustments are required to be reflected in the earnings per share calculation. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $89.1 million or $1.43 per share in the current year quarter versus $57.4 million or $0.92 per share in the prior year. The significant sales growth and resulting improved operating earnings previously discussed were the primary drivers of this increase. With regards to cash income taxes, the third quarter of 2018 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $15.2 million as compared to $10.9 million in the prior year quarter. The current year cash taxes reflect an anticipated cash income tax rate of approximately 15% for the full year 2018, while the prior year third quarter was based on a cash tax rate of 17% for the full year 2017. The current year cash tax rate benefits from the Tax Reform Act. However, this benefit is partially offset by a higher level of pre-tax earnings that are taxed at the GAAP income tax rate of approximately 23% to 25% for 2018. As a reminder, our favorable tax shield of approximately $30 million per year through annual intangible amortization on our tax return results in our cash income tax rate being notably lower than our GAAP income tax rate. Cash flow from operations was $59.3 million as compared to $66.3 million in the prior year third quarter, and free cash flow was $47 million as compared to $60.4 million in the same quarter last year. Higher operating earnings were more than offset by the timing of certain cash flows related to pensions, taxes, interest, capital expenditures, and sales of extended warranties. In particular, we made a $9 million pension prepayment during the current year third quarter to take advantage of certain tax savings and lower administrative costs. On a last 12 months basis, free cash flow remains strong at $238 million. As of September 30, 2018, we had a total of $947 million of outstanding debt and $174 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand. Our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.4 times on an as-reported basis, declining from 3.0 times at the end of last year. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, there was approximately $207 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. Both our term loan and ABL now mature in the year 2023. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our improved outlook for 2018.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, York. As our end markets continue to strengthen more than originally expected, we are once again raising our guidance for revenue growth for full year 2018. We now expect net sales to increase approximately 19% to 20% over the prior year, which is an improvement from the 13% to 14% growth previously forecast. Core sales growth is now expected to be approximately 16% to 17%, which is an increase from the previous guidance of approximately 10%. This improved net sales outlook is primarily due to stronger residential product sales given higher than expected power outage severity and favorable market conditions. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year 2018 before adjusting for non-controlling interests are now expected to be approximately 21%, which is an increase from the 20% previously forecasted. The improvement in margin guidance is a result of increased operating leverage on the higher core sales growth, as well as an improved sales mix. We continue to monitor the status of the current and proposed importation tariffs very closely. Given our inventory turns, we expect these tariffs to be largely a 2019 consideration. In order to mitigate the anticipated future impact, we are currently evaluating pricing, supply chain, engineering and operational strategies. We're also monitoring external factors such as commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Overall, we remain confident that we can fully offset any additional tariff-related costs through these activities, as well as other potential cost reduction initiatives. Given this increased net sales outlook for the remainder of 2018, we are currently ramping up our production efforts to execute on the robust demand that is in front of us. As we drive incremental organic growth, our operational and free cash flow generation is still expected to remain strong and follow the historical seasonality, with the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow now forecasted to be approximately 80% to 85% for the year. In closing today, we are very pleased with our record third quarter results, which demonstrates our ability to execute as demand remains strong across our business. The fundamentals of our residential products business have never been stronger, with IHCs, activations, dealer count and portable generator market share at all-time highs. C&I order rates and backlog, particularly for natural gas gensets, continue to grow as the current economic environment remains strong. Higher oil prices, growth in non-residential construction, and the prospects for additional large-scale infrastructure projects should benefit our C&I mobile products in the future. Internationally, we continue to expand our geographic penetration as we continue to build a Tier 1 global power generation solutions provider. With the momentum we are seeing across our business, I'm optimistic about our performance for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. First of all, congratulations to the whole team for, again, rising to this enormous challenge that you have to face there. And I just wanted to ask a high level question first. You talked at the Analyst Day, Aaron and York, a lot about the rollout of the prime power demand response opportunity, the potential to double the TAM. I'm asking this question first just because I think we're very quickly going to be answering questions for investors around difficult comparisons and where does the growth come from down the road. And this just sounds like a very, very important driver. So, if you can give an update there and when we start to see more of the impact from that initiative.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Brian. So we talked about a lot of things at the Investor Day, but we talked about one thing in particular there, was around our Lead Gas initiative part of our strategy, which today, – so, there's two components of that. The first component is the continued substitution in the market, the existing market of legacy diesel, a traditional genset being switched over to gas. And we're starting to see that and have been seeing that for a number of years, and as we've said many times before, we believe we're the leader in that industry. We also believe that there's a lot of legs to go yet, a lot of room to run with that substitution. And we estimate the U.S. market today is about 60% diesel gensets, 40% natural gas. And that's changed dramatically over the last 30 years. And we believe that it's going to continue to change in a very positive fashion, and we're going to be at the forefront of capturing that. To that end, we're introducing a lot of new products, larger nodes, additional product options and features, controls, things that will, in our minds, make us – make those gensets, even in the larger KW ranges, very attractive; natural gas versus diesel. Longer-term, we also talk about one of the growth areas with natural gas being the potential for demand response, time of use type programs, combined heat and power, other uses for that natural gas generator technology beyond the standby market. So we're referring to it as kind of beyond standby internally here. And so, today, we have non-standby ratings or limited prime and prime ratings for certain gensets, and basically de-rated machines with some existing – with some additional feature sets, and obviously, the appropriate certifications when it comes to emissions profiles for those products. Those are in the market today. And, in fact, we see, in particular, there's a couple of pockets of strength we're already seeing around certain regions. Canada being one of them where time of use type programs where the generator can be run at times of day were very similar to what you'd see in a classic demand response type program, just more on an individual site location as opposed to being aggregated. An individual owner operator can reduce their utility bill by running that generator during peak times. We believe in the future that this is an incredibly important potential growth avenue for power generation companies in particular, but given our position as the leader in natural gas, we definitely like how we're uniquely positioned there to take advantage of that and capitalize on that. But that's a long-term trend, and those are things that are going to take time to develop. There are macro trends of utility costs. There are macro trends of regulation. There are macro trends of natural gas pricing and the input costs, but that spark spread, as we've talked about, continues to be favorable for those programs. So, it's going to play out over time. We think that the conversion from diesel to natural gas on the standby market is a very real opportunity that's being executed on now. We have new products in the market and, we continue to see, as we said in our prepared remarks, very good results on natural gas product lines.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot. I guess one much more targeted question. You mentioned the assisted living dynamic that's playing out in Florida and that could roll into 2019. Is there any way to estimate what percentage of that work would be done in 2018, and what percentage rolls over into 2019?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I think, at this point, if you were to look, and there's a lot of public information available on this, but about two-thirds of the sites are being flagged as in compliance. But when you dig a little deeper on that, in compliance means they could also be receiving a waiver for a period of time to extend beyond the end of the year. So, in terms of the raw dollars that have probably been deployed, it's maybe 50% of the dollars to-date, and there'll be a little bit more obviously here in the remainder of the year. And then there's going to be a chunk of that that's going to roll forward into next year. So, we're trying to get our arms around that. For us, it's a little bit hard to pull together all of those numbers because we use an omni-channel approach for distribution. So, we have a lot of channels where the product goes through and we don't have great visibility in the end application in all cases. We do when it's in our industrial channels as we have much more limited distribution there, and we're generally involved in much more complex projects in terms of the engineering work that goes behind that. So those we have better visibility to. The smaller bed facilities where you're going to get a more standard machine implemented, we don't have great visibility. That could be going through our residential dealer channels, our wholesale channels, maybe even – some of our e-comm channels for all that we know.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll get back in line. Thanks.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Ben Burud on for Jerry.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Ben.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey. Morning, Ben.
Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Morning. Your guidance is for sales to be down sequentially in 4Q off really strong levels compared to normal seasonality of higher sales in 4Q. Have installed rates for residential standby slowed significantly or are there other drivers of this?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. The sales in Q4 are going to be roughly flat and in line with Q3.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean the implied guidance would have it pretty darn close, and the reality is you got Q3 coming there. We're selling a large amount of portables in Q3 as the immediate impact from Hurricane Florence, which – with Michael being – in terms of portable generator sales, we didn't see as much of an event in terms of impact on portable generator sales with Michael. There might be a sequential decline there, but we expect that to be made up with home standby. So, I'm not expecting a big decline sequentially.
Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. And for residential standby, did you reach a new shipment record this quarter? And what's the backlog in the business as we enter 4Q?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. We did reach a – all of our metrics for resi were highs for us. Portable shipments were – they comped a little bit below last year, but just an incredible quarter even for the quarter we had. But, across the board, when you look at all the resi products, they were in record territory. As far as backlog, we don't comment specifically on backlog, but I think, again, I'd point to my prepared remarks this morning, which when we look at our leading indicators of in-home consultations, those have been very strong all year. In fact, they're actually, on a year-to-date basis, comping positive to the prior year. And the prior year IHCs were amazing in terms of the volumes we saw. As we said, Ben – we said this on previous calls but the systems we have in place today to find and target and market directly to potential home standby buyers, in particular, those systems are all largely new in the last five years. So, we really hadn't had kind of an up-cycle in terms of outages in which to pressure test those systems. Last year was really the first opportunity to do that with Irma and Maria and some of the other events that happened. And we saw just some tremendous numbers in terms of the indicators there. And those are translating well into record activations. Our dealer count is at 6,000 dealers and growing. So, we see some great days ahead in terms of growth on a year-over-year basis for residential. So, a lot of really good leading indicators there for those products.
Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Jeff.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, can you just talk on – I don't know if you can rank it or rank order of magnitude, the growth rates in the mobile versus healthcare versus telecom just so we can get a sense of how strong each of those markets are.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I think oddly enough, Jeff, when you look at them from a growth percentage rate, mobile actually was the leader in that if I had to rank order it. When it comes to resi or – excuse me, to telecom and healthcare, telecom was up very nicely in the quarter, and then healthcare was also up nicely. But if I ranked order them, I'd go mobile, telecom and then healthcare.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: And I think they were all strong, though. I think...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Very strong. Yeah.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: So...
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then tariffs, you said mostly a 2019 impact. If you take the 232 and all the 301 lists, how big of a headwind does that look like? Is there a way to quantify it? You talked about kind of reengineering in supply chain. What are some of the things that you're contemplating to kind of move around some of those headwinds?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I think, again, Jeff, we'd point to the fact that rather than commenting like on specific dollars, we don't think – the headwinds themselves, we don't think will be headwinds because we think we're going to take and we are taking actions to mitigate those through pricing, supply chain moves and operational strategies, things of that nature. Specifically around supply chain, there are abilities for us to – there are certain things we can onshore here. Now, obviously, those could be at a premium to cost, but – to current low cost country outsourcing, but the premium would obviously be lower than the tariffs. So, I think there's still some things to be decided there on – the tariffs today are slated to go from 10% to 25% on this – the third list of the 301 items. And that's going to happen on January 1, unless something else happens before that. So we're approaching it as if it's going to happen. And there are some things to resource, but remember, resourcing takes time, there's qualification of new suppliers. When we can move it in our own factories, it's easier. When we have to move it to other countries, whether that'd be other countries in Asia or India, there's other low-cost countries around the world that have suddenly become popular outside of some of the targeted countries that are impacted by the tariffs, it will take time to resource supply chains to those countries because they just don't have the same level of development that exists today in China. So, we continue to work with supply chain partners. We'll continue to work very hard with our teams internally. We have a separate team that we've established internally here that's targeting – it's a cross functional team that's targeting all aspects of tariffs because obviously, the impact of that is – we actually believe it's something we can turn into a positive for ourselves. Portable generators are a good example. Every portable generator in North America is imported with the exception of the ones that we make in Jefferson, Wisconsin. So, nobody else makes portable generators in North America, we do. We import gens as well and we'll have tariff considerations there, but we have the ability to shift production to an existing facility here in the U.S. So, I think that's more difficult for other competitors and something that will give us, we believe, an advantage. And that's just one example.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And have you announced any price action specifically or do you do that through less discounting or...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, so we've begun to talk to our channel partners about pricing. We haven't announced any formal price increases at this stage of the game. Again, kind of waiting to see with certainty, what's going to happen with – will that 25% actually kick in on January 1. That's the big one for us. To be honest, the 232 tariffs had some impact, but it's minimal. Some of the previous 301 lists that are in place already also have an impact, but the larger impact is coming in the third list, which is this 10% to 25% step, which we want to see how that plays out.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And if I could sneak one more in, just what kind of feedback are you getting from Florence and Michael on home standby? Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So we've seen – again, when you get these types of – even though – let's just talk about those events for a second. They're not big events in the context of an Irma or something like that, right? I mean, they're horrible, tragic, property damage causing, life losing types of events, not to minimize the impact, but in terms of power outages, they don't have the same type of impact that previous events have had. So, in our vernacular, we wouldn't classify them as major outage events. That being said, they have all happened in a similar area in the country. And with that type of serial nature of events like that, when people experience outages, even if the duration is not long, it's only a couple of days instead of a couple of weeks, things like that, the impact of and the prospect for more outages like that is really what can be what tips people into buying the product, right? We've always said that duration is an important element of what gets people to buy the category, but so is frequency; the combination of frequency and duration. So, these storms, with the nature of the frequency over the last two years, has got people definitely shopping the category a lot more. As I said before, in-home consultations, which is our leading indicator for sales leads for residential standby, they're actually comping positive this year, which, after last year's numbers that we saw, we didn't know that, that could even be possible. But I think what we're deciding is that, and York kind of alluded to this on the call, the category is becoming a lot more mainstream. Awareness is much greater for the category. We've got tremendous coverage in terms of distribution with over 6,000 dealers. The category's available ubiquitously in many, many places, and it's become a lot more mainstream. People – 10 years ago, you would have said home standby generator and they wouldn't have known what you're talking about. Today, you mentioned that, and in particular regions, it's something that is part of the everyday vernacular. So, I think this is an important turning point, we believe, in the category. And I think it was demonstrated last year. Everybody talked about tough comps in the second half of this year. Here we are, we're going to comp positive back half of the year, no problem. Obviously, we've got some weather, although not major, that has winded our back for that, but we like the setup here going forward with all the indicators.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, thanks, Aaron. Good color, as always.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is open.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Mike.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Mike.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So, just kind of want to piggyback on the last question. Obviously, the dynamics around the multi-year, the last couple years of outage activity are different than the dynamics seen historically when you've had significant periods in a row of outage activity. Maybe if you could just talk about some of the puts and takes here, particularly how that backlog that you see today, which is at record levels, how that should bleed relative to history, what your expectation is for carry-through relative to history, and maybe try to put some framework around the concept you just mentioned about how the awareness has up-ticked and what you think that can mean for what the ultimate new normal can look like here.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: No, it's a great question, Mike. I think, just to clarify on backlog, our comments about record backlog were really about C&I products. So, resi products are not – we had frankly larger backlog dollars coming into 2013 after the successive years of Sandy and some of the other events in the Northeast. So, that aside, we'll have a decent backlog coming into 2019 with resi, but nowhere near record levels. Our capabilities to ramp production today are in a much different place. But the numbers we're talking about, just the daily rates and things, which we don't quote because it's competitively sensitive, are really very encouraging for the category and what's transpired over the last five years. So, let's talk about that. After that period of elevated outages and those kind of serial patterns we went through kind of in 2010, 2011 and 2012, we saw 2013 and 2014 were nice years for the category, but we went almost five years without any types of events after that. So, it was a very low period in terms of outage activity. Our own tracking mechanisms showed that, a lot of other data corroborated that. And yet, the category, still, when you looked at it from this concept of a new higher baseline that we talk about, the baseline category, even after the initial demand surge settled down from those events back then, settled into a pattern that was materially higher than where it was previous to that. So, fast forward to today, we've gone now a couple years with some of these events kind of back to back to back, and in some of the same regions of the country. And I think what's different this time and what gives me pause to say, well, it's going to settle back down into a new norm, which it will, but how high is that new norm, right? We have to look at that and we have to kind of – we have to pick a number internally here so that we can calibrate our own business and how we're going to run the business from a capacity standpoint, manning everything else we need. And we look at that and we say, okay, how is this time different than the last time? Well, I alluded to this in one of the previous questions, which is we put a ton of effort around driving awareness for home standby. So infomercials, the selling systems, PowerPlay, the iPad-based selling systems, all the statistics, the data, the findability, the things that we're doing to create sales leads, to nurture those sales leads, to convert those sales leads, I mean, those didn't exist five, six years ago. So, I take that – and you put that in context of kind of a higher level of awareness, context of the serial level of outages, and I'm very encouraged based on what we're seeing, the leading indicators about – we talk about this internally here. Have we reached the tipping point with home standby? Is this going to go mainstream? Penetration rates are around 4% of U.S. households today. Is this where things start to accelerate? When you look at other installed home product categories, all of them get an inflection point at some point. And I think we're reaching what feels to me like an inflection point with residential standby. Time will tell and we'll play that out as we go forward, but we're very encouraged by what we're seeing today in all those metrics.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then, speaking of tipping points, your prepared remarks certainly seem more constructive on the commercial side. And after – I honestly think – I think since I picked up coverage of this back when you originally turned public, we've at least had conversations about when your small business owners to medium-sized business owners are going to start thinking more about the value proposition of having backup power. It sounds like from your prepared remarks, you're starting to see more progress there. Why now? Is it the health of the economy? Is it the outage activity that people are seeing broadly? I mean, why do you think it's happening now and how sustainable? And maybe just some thoughts around that.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So I think there's a couple of larger factors at play there, Mike. The first is just the macro trend of outages, right? I mean, even though we went through a period of low outages, outages, when you look over a 30-year period, have been increasing. And so, if you're a business owner, the prospect of losing power and the disruption that that causes to your operations, and in particular today, the digitization of business, the economy, the impact on productivity when you lose a continuous supply of power is unbelievable. I mean, things stop and get very primitive very quickly. It's one thing for a homeowner, right? There's the inconvenience factor in most cases or property damage, other things that are severe. But, for a business person, you're talking about a disruption in livelihood. And especially if you're in a significantly prone area to outages, it's almost untenable to think you wouldn't have – we all have disaster recovery plans and other risk mitigation plans in our businesses today. This just becomes an element of that in my mind. So it's become a part of managing that what is, for most people, a real risk of losing power. So, I think there's that piece of it. I think the other piece of it, though, is that the product offering, again, when you look at natural gas, becoming more available, becoming more ubiquitous, it's affordable. So when you look at smaller businesses, this is not something that you have to think of in terms of a 10-year payback. A reciprocating engine driven genset powered on natural gas can pay back in one outage for a small business. We've said this before. Eight hours of outage for a grocery store or a small gas station can be paid for. The entire genset's paid for in that single outage. So, I think the ROI is very strong for the category. A lot of that is because that cost position on the product has come down very nicely over the last couple decades.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: I think with the favorable economic environment backdrop that's helping, too, with the strong residential construction, you see buildings being built everywhere. Everywhere you travel, that's helping obviously, and you alluded to that, Mike, but I think the regulatory impacts, too. When you have outages, then, you tend to get more discussion around the regulatory impacts, and we see that in the Florida healthcare opportunity. And then, you start getting more dialogue about telecom and having mandates around backup power on cell towers. And so, I think you put all of those factors together and all that's driving our C&I business at least domestically. And then you have all the other factors internationally as we continue to grow out our international business.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Appreciate the answers as always. Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Jadgfeld.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Well, I thank everyone for joining us this morning, and we look forward to reporting our fourth quarter 2018 results, which we anticipate will be at some point in mid-February. So, with that, we'll leave you to your morning. Thank you very much.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-08-01 09:00:00) =====
Executives: York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc. Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.
Analysts: Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2018 Generac Holdings, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2018 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Overall, our results this quarter were the best second quarter numbers that Generac has experienced, with robust year-over-year organic sales growth leading to strong improvements in margins as we leveraged our operating costs and demonstrated the earnings power of the company. Specifically, overall net sales increased 25.3% compared to the prior year, with core sales growth of approximately 23%, when excluding the favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This sales growth drove an overall 190 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 300 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins. Demand for residential home standby and portable generators was strong again this quarter, given the afterglow from power outages in previous quarters. In-home consultations and end user activations remain elevated as we head into the second half of the year with continued momentum. Shipments of domestic commercial and industrial, or C&I products, also experienced significant growth during the quarter, driven mainly by the ongoing replacement cycle for mobile products, as well as solid growth in orders and shipments for stationary products. Sales within our International segment continue to grow as well, as global demand for our backup power generation equipment remains strong, helping to drive double-digit EBITDA margins in the segment. Our second quarter results highlight the benefit from the increased awareness of the home standby product category, primarily from the afterglow demand generated by the active 2017 hurricane season and the storms in the Northeastern U.S. in the first quarter. As a result, shipments of home standby generators in the quarter increased significantly again compared to the prior year. The recent higher outage environment has allowed us to make further progress with optimizing our targeted marketing and PowerPlay in-home selling solution to generate more sales leads and improve close rates. In-home consultations, or IHCs, also increased significantly during the quarter, a good leading indicator of future home standby demand. And end user activations remain very strong, with activity in the Southeast and Northeast regions growing dramatically compared to prior year levels. In addition, we continue to expand and develop our distribution, ending the quarter with approximately 5,900 residential dealers who sell, install, and service our products. Toward the end of the quarter, we also began to ship the latest version of our flagship home standby product line, which includes WiFi connectability as a standard feature. The ability for these products to be remotely monitored will allow homeowners to gain further peace of mind that their generator stands ready to protect their home and their family. Additionally, our dealers will now have access to important information about their generator fleet to improve their efficiency and effectiveness regarding service intervals and critical repairs, including the ability to view activity logs and error messages, and perform selective maintenance functions remotely. The new WiFi-enabled generators are also capable of receiving important firmware updates automatically, such as product improvements as well as new features for our customers that may be developed in the future. The launch of WiFi-connected products marks an important milestone for the home standby generator category, which we believe will only further improve our customers' experience and dealer engagement, and also provides us with a tremendous amount of knowledge about the use of these products, while creating additional revenue streams and future opportunities to further monetize a home standby generator. Shipments of portable generators also grew substantially compared to the prior year, and were higher than expected due to retail channel replenishment resulting from the elevated outage environment experienced in recent quarters. Additionally, we are launching a number of new portable generators in the second half of the year, including a new inverter product offering, a new PRO generator line, and a series of products that include our new CO-SENSE technology, that shuts down a portable generator automatically and alerts the user when high levels of carbon monoxide are detected. This innovative new safety feature is the result of years of research and development around improving the safe operation of these products, and has been very well received by our retail channel partners and end users. The combination of these new product launches, coupled with our team's execution during last year's active hurricane season, allowed us to win additional retail shelf space for our portable generators for the coming season, which should benefit the second half of the year. Demand for domestic mobile products, primarily serving the rental markets, also remained strong during the quarter, adding to the recovery that began early last year. Similar to the last several quarters, the majority of the improvement came from our national account customer base as they continue to refresh their fleets. Additionally during the quarter, we saw increased demand for our oil and gas-related mobile equipment, as higher energy prices are helping to improve fleet utilization rates for the specialty equipment rental companies that serve this market. We remain optimistic about the further growth for mobile products, with the ongoing fleet refresh cycle, rebounding oil and gas markets, and impacts from recent tax reform all underpinning higher future demand for the product category. Shipments of stationary C&I products in North America during the quarter were up substantially compared to the prior year, as we began to see the positive effects of higher baseline outage activity impacting demand. In particular, interest in backup generators for the telecom market improved, as certain national account customers allocated capital to new projects focused on protecting the uptime of their wireless networks. In addition, we are seeing positive trends with our industrial distributors, as improvements in quotation and order rates are beginning to translate into higher shipments. In particular, interest in our natural gas products continues to grow, as we have recently introduced a number of higher output models, thereby further extending the use of natural gas generators in larger projects. Also during the quarter, activity associated with the state of Florida's legislation requiring that nursing homes and assisted living facilities have sufficient backup power began to have an impact across our distribution channels. In addition to engaging directly with several national account customers on a number of projects, we are also working with our distributors, dealers and wholesale channel partners on several opportunities with other long-term care providers in the state. Although we are optimistic about the potential for incremental business in the coming quarters as a result of the new regulations, it is also clear that the resulting demand will likely roll over into 2019, due to the lengthy permitting process and challenging labor environment, which are both contributing to extend the typical project cycle associated with these types of products. In addition to a strong domestic market, our International segment continued to add to its recent track record, with sales growth of approximately 27% and margin expansion of 350 basis points as compared to the prior year second quarter. Importantly, the International segment has also expanded margins on a year-over-year basis in each of the past three quarters, due to a number of factors, most notably from synergy execution, improved sales mix, and leverage of fixed manufacturing and operating expenses on the higher sales volumes. We believe these favorable trends and financial performance will continue throughout 2018 as we work to gain market share in the regions around the world that we serve, and as we further focus on optimizing the margin profile of these businesses. More specifically, we continue to build on the strength of our International business, by further expanding our presence in the important Latin American markets, as we closed on the acquisition of Selmec late in the second quarter. Headquartered in Mexico City and with a history spanning more than 75 years, Selmec is a leading designer and manufacturer of diesel and gaseous fueled industrial generators, ranging from 10-kilowatts to 2.75 megawatts. With particular experience in telecom, data centers, and other mission critical applications, Selmec is an excellent complementary fit with our current footprint in Latin America and should allow us to dynamically scale and leverage our existing operations and distribution in this region to offer the Latin American market a broader portfolio of products and solutions. With approximately one-quarter of our business now being transacted outside the U.S. and Canada, we believe Generac is quickly developing into a global power equipment leader with one of the broadest product lines and distribution networks in the industry. I now want to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our second quarter results. York?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Aaron. Before discussing second quarter results in more detail, recall that effective January 1, 2018, Generac adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition accounting standard. For comparability purposes, the full retrospective method was elected under the standard, which requires application to all periods presented. Although the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements, the prior year 2017 figures that we are discussing this morning have been adjusted accordingly. Now, looking at our second quarter results in more detail, net sales for the quarter increased 25.3% to $494.9 million, as compared to $394.9 million in the second quarter of 2017, including $4 million of contribution from the June 1, 2018 Selmec acquisition. Core sales growth, which excludes the favorable impact of both acquisitions and foreign currency, was approximately 23% over the prior year. Looking at consolidated net sales by product class, residential product sales during the second quarter increased 24.1% to $246.4 million, as compared to $198.5 million in the prior year quarter. As Aaron mentioned, the current year quarter experienced strong growth in shipments of both home standby and portable generators, as end market demand for these products continued to be robust, given the afterglow from last year's hurricane season, together with higher baseline outages. Our intense focus and operating model has allowed us to successfully execute on this recent outage-driven demand. In addition, we continue to accelerate baseline demand on an everyday basis through our initiatives to drive awareness, availability, affordability and connectivity for automatic home standby generators. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales for the second quarter of 2018 increased 26.9%, to $215.6 million, as compared to $169.9 million in the prior quarter, with core sales growth being approximately 21%. This core growth was broad-based globally, as C&I shipments accelerated during the current year quarter. Domestically, we experienced strong growth from our industrial distributors, as both quoting and ordering rates improved. In addition, the telecom market began to recover and health care opportunities related to new regulations in Florida materialized during the quarter. The replacement cycle for our mobile C&I products remains strong, with our national rental account customers continuing to invest in their fleets. Internationally, our Latin American shipments grew organically at a solid pace, while we also closed on the Selmec acquisition on June 1 of this quarter. Our Pramac business also experienced very strong growth, driven by large product volume, market growth in Mainland Europe and the continued expansion of our business in the Asia Pacific region. Net sales for the other products category, primarily comprised of service parts, increased 24.2% to $32.9 million, as compared to $26.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. This strong growth was largely due to increased demand for replacement parts resulting from the elevated power outage activity experienced during recent quarters, as well as the growing install base of our products on a global basis. Gross profit margin expanded 190 basis points to 35.6%, compared to 33.7% in the prior year second quarter. The expansion in margins was driven by improved leverage of fixed manufacturing costs on the significant increase in sales, a more favorable pricing environment, and focused cost reduction initiatives to lower product costs and improve margins. These improvements were partially offset by a slightly unfavorable sales mix and general inflationary pressures from higher commodities, currencies, wages and logistics costs. Operating expenses increased $9.7 million, or 11.9%, as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses, excluding intangible amortization, declined 150 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to improved operating leverage on the higher organic sales volumes. The increase in operating expense dollars over the prior year was driven by: higher variable expenses on the higher sales volumes; an increase in employee costs, including additional incentive compensation; and increased international operating expenses due to the stronger euro. These increases were partially offset by lower promotional costs benefiting from improved end market demand and lower intangible amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $99.6 million in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to $68.3 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin, before deducting for noncontrolling interests, was 20.7% in the quarter, as compared to 17.7% in the prior year. This 300 basis point increase compared to the prior year was largely due to the previously mentioned price cost dynamics that improved gross profit margins and the favorable operating leverage on the strong organic increase in sales. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 24.8% to $381 million, as compared to $305.4 million in the prior year quarter. As I previously discussed, this impressive organic growth was broad-based, driven by strong shipments of home standby generators, portables, C&I mobile products, C&I stationary generators, and service parts. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $90.6 million, or 23.8% of net sales, as compared to $63.7 million in the prior year, or 20.9% of net sales. International segment sales increased 27.3% to $113.9 million, as compared to $89.5 million in the prior year quarter, including $4 million of contribution from the Selmec acquisition. Core sales growth was approximately 16% for the segment, primarily due to robust shipments of C&I products across our Pramac, Ottomotores and Motortech subsidiaries. As we continue to grow the International segment, adjusted EBITDA, before deducting for noncontrolling interests, improved to (15:26) $11.6 million, or 10.2% of net sales, as compared to $6 million4 or 6.7% of net sales, in the prior year. Now, switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2018 on a consolidated basis, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $53.3 million, as compared to $25.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in operating earnings previously discussed, together with the lower GAAP tax rate, contributed to this increase in GAAP net income. GAAP income taxes during the second quarter of 2018 were $18.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 25.3%, as compared to $13.9 million, or 35.4% for the prior year. The large decline in GAAP tax rate is primarily due the enactment of the tax reform act, which became effective in December of 2017. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.82 in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $0.41 in the prior year. The specific calculations of these earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release. Note that current quarter earnings per share were impacted by a $2.3 million adjustment to increase the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest for the Pramac acquisition, resulting in a $0.04 reduction in GAAP earnings per share. Under U.S. GAAP accounting rules, any adjustments to this redemption value are recorded directly to retained earnings, however, the redemption value adjustments are required to be reflected in the earnings per share calculation. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $68.9 million in the current year quarter versus $42.7 million in the prior year. The significant sales growth and improved operating earnings just discussed were the primary drivers of this increase. With regards to cash income taxes, the second quarter of 2018 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $11.1 million, as compared to 5.6 million in the prior year quarter. The current year cash taxes now reflect an anticipated cash income tax rate of approximately 14% to 15% for the full year 2018, while the prior year second quarter was based on a cash tax rate of 14% for the full year 2017. The current year cash tax rate benefits from the tax reform act, however, this is fully offset by a higher level of pre-tax earnings, anticipated for the full year 2018, as every incremental dollar of profit over and beyond our tax shield is taxed at the GAAP income tax rate of approximately 26% for 2018. As a reminder, our favorable tax shield of approximately $30 million through our annual intangible amortization deduction on our tax return, results in our cash income tax rate being notably lower than our GAAP income tax rate. Adjusted diluted net income per share for the company, as reconciled in our earnings release, was $1.11 per share for the current year quarter compared to $0.68 in the prior year. Cash flow from operations was $50.7 million, as compared to $59.5 million in the prior year second quarter. And free cash flow was $45.9 million, as compared to $53.7 million in the same quarter last year. This year-over-year decline in cash flow reflected incremental working capital investment related to our strong organic sales growth and the replenishment of inventory levels in anticipation of the summer storm season. On a last 12 months basis, free cash flow was $251 million. As of June 30, 2018, we had a total of $933 million of outstanding debt and $112 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $821 million. Our net debt leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.2 times on an as-reported basis, declining from the 3.5 times at the same time last year. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, there was approximately $192 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. Given the recent amendments of our term loan and revolving ABL credit facilities, both our term loan and ABL now mature in the year 2023. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our improved outlook for 2018.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, York. As our end markets continue to improve more than originally expected, and given the June 1 closing of the Selmec acquisition, we are raising our guidance for revenue growth for full year 2018. We now expect net sales to improve between 13% to 14% over the prior year, which is an increase from the 6% to 8% growth previously forecast. Recall that the second half of 2017 included elevated portable generator shipments from the active hurricane season. And with no major power outages assumed in our current guidance, we estimate there is an approximately 4% growth headwind related to this strong prior year comparison. Importantly, core sales growth is now expected to be approximately 10%, which is an increase from the previous guidance of 5% to 6%. This change is primarily due to improving end market conditions for both domestic residential and C&I products, as order rates remain strong heading into the second half of the year. In fact, we now expect second half home standby generator shipments to increase year-over-year, as many of the initiatives we have worked on over the last several years are helping to extend the afterglow period and contribute to the new and higher baseline of demand for these products that is developing. Our top-line guidance assumes no major power outage events in 2018 and also assumes a baseline power outage severity level for the remainder of the year similar to that of the longer-term average. Should the baseline power outage environment be higher or if there's major outage activity in the second half of the year, it is likely we could exceed these expectations. For historical perspective, an average major power outage event could result in $50 million or more of additional sales, depending on a number of variables. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year 2018, before adjusting for noncontrolling interests, are now expected to be approximately 20%, which is an increase from the 19% to 19.5% previously expected. The improvement in margins is a result of increased operating leverage on the higher core sales growth, as well as a favorable sales mix. We continue to very closely monitor the status of the recently announced importation tariffs and are estimating the impact on our business of the various proposals. Given the likely timing around their implementation and considering our pricing lags from supply chain and our inventory turns, we would expect these tariffs, if they are enacted, to be largely a 2019 consideration. In order to mitigate the anticipated future impact, we are currently evaluating pricing strategies, as well as supply chain, engineering, and operational changes in response to these tariffs. Overall, we are confident that we can fully offset these additional costs through these mitigation activities, as well as other potential cost reduction initiatives. For full year 2018, operating and free cash flow generation is expected to remain strong and follow historical seasonality, benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow, which is still forecasted to be over 90% for the year. In addition, we are providing an update on certain other guidance details to help model the company's earnings per share and cash flows for the full year. Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $42 million, as a result of the lower LIBOR margin spreads from the term loan and ABL refinancing transactions that closed during the second quarter. Additionally, as a result of the expected improved earnings outlook, cash taxes are now anticipated to be approximately $39 million to $40 million, which translates into a full year 2018 cash income tax rate of between 14% to 15%. GAAP and tangible amortization expense for the year is now expected to be approximately $22 million, given the additional amortization from the Selmec acquisition. And, as a result of our higher net sales outlook, capital expenditures are now forecasted to be approximately 2% of net sales for the full year. In closing today, we are very pleased with our results for the first half of the year, which we believe demonstrates the tremendous earnings power of the company. I'm incredibly proud of our team's ability to execute, as demand for our products has accelerated and continues to be very strong. With the momentum we are seeing across the entire business, I'm optimistic about our performance for the remainder of 2018 and beyond as we establish a new and higher baseline of demand and we further execute on our Powering Ahead strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning., and pretty impressive quarter.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: I had a question about the adjusted EBITDA margin and the strong incrementals at International. Do you kind of view the 10% and runway from there as kind of sustainable, at this point?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I think on the International side, we're very proud of the 10%. We've been talking about growing the International margins as we execute on the synergies and drive the top-line growth. And so, International had a great quarter. And you can really see the leverage of that fixed operating cost layer that they have to support that global business come through with the 10%. Expect to see continued year-over-year growth, expect to see continued strong EBITDA margins, depending on how that comes through from quarter-to-quarter, but for the full second half, we expect those strong margins to continue.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, and, Chris, this is Aaron. I think it's important to note that it really does fit our thesis all along here with International. We see tremendous opportunity for Generac's products, which have generally historically only been available here in the U.S. and Canada. By putting those products into the distribution that we've acquired internationally, we see – and have said this many times, we see a lot of upside potential. That's gas products. It's residential, standby products, as well as all the wonderful synergies that we think have been available to us around sourcing and operations. And we think we're executing on that. And that really is underpinning, I think, that growth in margins that you're seeing, that expansion of margins, along with, as York pointed out, the top-side growth is also giving us good leverage on that kind of larger fixed operating cost of an international business.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: How would you quantify or qualify the pull of the legacy Generac products for gas and resi standby?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: It's early. I mean, the world market has traditionally been a diesel market. And so, getting those types of products in the hands of distributors and our distribution and channel partners and getting them to understand the differences, and, frankly, obviously, the benefits of gas that we experience here in the U.S. I mean, the U.S. market is pretty well developed that way. And the growth rates for gas in the U.S. market over the last 20 years, have been about double that of the traditional diesel market. We think that that same type of growth rate'll play out globally, but it's going to take time. We've always said it's a long-term story, and we're in this for the long term. But we had to have the distribution and we had to have the local footprints, really, to enable that. And so, we're in the very early innings of enablement there, and what we've been working on, really, to this point, is squeezing out all the synergies around the existing product lines that these subsidiaries have. And I think we've been reasonably successful in that regard. And then, I have think having them be part of a larger organization and focused kind of on a global execution has helped them to grow their top lines as well, which again is helping leverage the operating cost structure.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: While creating a market on the nat gas side.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Right.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Okay, and then, lastly, just wondering if the levels of business you're seeing with the rental companies and their fleet refresh cycle, if there's any sense that that activity is kind of pulling forward and front-loading a little bit?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Everything we see there when we talk to our customers – and we are a supplier to all of the major national account customers, as well as all of our smaller independent channel partners, is that the market, the end market, is strong. So their utilization rates are up, which is helping prop up rental rates, which obviously gives them a lot of confidence in continuing to invest in their fleets. And I would say that I think in a typical refresh cycle, maybe we'd be later innings, but I think in this particular refresh cycle, the uniqueness of that almost two-year period of deferral of CapEx spending by many of these customers has created a situation where the refresh cycle just has to go longer. So I think for us, we see it as being very solidly kind of middle innings. And then, we've got, obviously, on the backside of that, the opportunity with oil and gas. And as higher energy prices continue to be supportive of those activities, in particular, we're seeing marked interest from the specialty rental companies that serve those markets. And that's been a welcome addition to the recovery there.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Thank you.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just a couple questions on the residential business, one, just kind of how would you characterize channel inventories for portables heading into the selling (29:58) season? It seems like those have been kind of struggling to catch up and low. And just maybe how would you characterize those? And then second, we picked up in the channel that you brought your 10-year warranty back. And I'm just wondering, one, what feedback are you getting? And two, just a little surprised, given how strong the underlying demand is that you'd need the higher rebate offer. Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. So on the channel inventories discussion, I think you hit it squarely on the head. We've said we've struggled to catch up all year, and with portable generators in particular, that's been the case. It's been a very strong year for portable gens, especially coming off of the nor'easters late in Q1, which really we were still struggling at that point to replenish off of last fall's active hurricane season. So the channel inventories for portable generators still, in our view, are below where they need to be. Now, we're catching up. We expect that the third quarter, and our guidance reflects this, that the channel inventories will return to a more appropriate level for a season. So you'll see some more of that channel refill in Q3. And I also mentioned we've got some unique things going on as well in the second half around new product rollouts and some additional shelf space wins, some placement that we got that we need to put stock in for. So we're going to continue to have, I think, a pretty decent year around port gens, and our guidance reflects that. On home standby, those channel inventories, it's interesting. They're lower in kind of aggregate. And in terms of the number of days of inventory, they're quite a bit lower and, in particular, when you look at certain regions. We mentioned significant strength in activations and interest in the product in the Southeast and the Northeast regions. Those regions are particularly low in inventory. So, we are working hard with our partners to get product in those markets. And I think that even in the other regions, I would say, that they're maybe adequate going into season, but I wouldn't say that they're, by any means, over-filled. On your second part of your question on the promotion, the 10-year warranty promotion, that we've running or that (32:21) we're currently running, that's a national promo. We plan our promo schedule far in advance, but that's a national promo. And while there are certain regions that are very strong, as we just talked about, that, being on a national basis, continuing to raise awareness for the category, is a really important element of growing the home standby baseline level of demand that we've talked about. And so, we feel that the 10-year extended warranty promo is a very cost effective way to continue to do that. And I think that that's something that our channel partners, in particular, it helps them get excited about the category. It helps them maybe tip potential future owners of the product category who might be on the fence. It helps them tip them over into the buying category. So we think it's an important thing to continue to promote. We have to be smart, obviously. And as we've mentioned in some of our other remarks, we've been able to improve our pricing power this year on the back of a stronger market, but you still need to promote the category. And, in particular, a category like this, where perpetration rates are low, we've got to get that baseline demand to continue to grow in the absence of events. And so we think that promoting is still an important part of that.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, as you kind of look at the tariff pressures, any way to kind of quantify what the impact would be on 2019, from the stuff you buy that might be on the list?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's like a moving target. I mean, I woke up this morning and, all of a sudden, the $200 billion list is being contemplated going from 10% to 25%. So I hesitate to give a number. I think the important element of this is that the impact, we believe there's enough mitigation strategies around combinations of pricing, resourcing, substitution of materials, potential operational changes and things of that nature, that we're going to fully offset this. And, obviously, it's an exercise that all companies that have any kind of importation have to go through, but it is what it is. We have to go through it and we have to figure out how to offset it. And we're working very hard. We're pushing our team very hard to do that. And that's obviously at the same time here, we're faced with rising demand across all of our end markets, so we're also working with supply chain to make sure we can satisfy that additional demand. So there's a lot of things going on, a lot of moving pieces, but I just hesitate to throw a number out. And I know others have, but I don't know the timing of when they're going to go in, and I don't even know what the number's going to be anymore, because it keeps changing. So until things get settled on that front, I think when we get better views on what the actual numbers are, we'll share that when we feel confident we think we know it. But I think important thing is whatever it is, we're going to fully offset it.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's fair. Thanks, Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Charley.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, Aaron, the commentary around the fact you're getting pricing and just you commented a moment ago about offsetting, mitigating the tariffs, but it sounds like you're being pretty successful at putting through price. I'm just wondering maybe a little more granularity on that. Is that across the board? Are you seeing it stronger or maybe more importantly perhaps, are there areas where you're struggling a little bit more to get price? I would have thought maybe you would have had a little bit more of a headwind on that, but sounds like it's not the case.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: No, I think what we're seeing here in the second quarter and actually even the first quarter, that the environment, we do have pricing power given the increased demands for our products, but we had laid this out. We saw our views on commodities and so you look at the residential side of the business, the C&I side of the business, and we rolled out our price increases in the beginning of the year. We also, as we rolled out our new flagship residential home standby product with WiFi connectivity, we also factored pricing into that product launch here in the second quarter. And then, you couple that with the incremental pricing power that we get, and the less discounting that we're doing, all of that equates to better price cost dynamics for the first half of the year and we feel confident that that can continue.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: And I mean, obviously, Charley, there are some areas where pricing can be harder to get, like we've got national account customers that you've got some, I won't call it contractual, but obviously, there are fees that were pinned around pricing, whether it be national rental accounts or whether it be some of our telecom customers. And so we have to work a little bit harder on those types of product lines to get cost out, as opposed to putting price in. But for the most part, most of our channel partners, they're either experiencing it themselves in terms of the inflationary pressures around everything from commodities to wages, to all the other inputs. But, as York said, I think one of the successful strategies that we've employed historically here is with new product launches. Innovation, I think the vitality of our new products is an incredibly important part of how we continue to give our customers additional value, but also in the same manner, we're able to get some pricing out of that. So I think that's been an historical hallmark of our company. And we're not going to slow down on that because we think it's an important part of the value of Generac.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, got it. And just on the commentary of outage activity being above average right now, can you give any sense as to, I guess, in the first half, how much above that long-term average is it and defined by how you folks track it, and kind of where you see the second half going on that? I mean, I know it's hard to predict. I'm just trying to get a sense of when things were going tough and we were well below average, it was obviously a focal point. Now we're above average. I'm just trying to gauge how much above that average we're at right now.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, fair comment. So, in Q1, I think we commented, especially with those nor'easters that hit in the month of March, Q1 came in above that long-term average. Q2, actually, was more in line with the long-term average. And so, therefore, for the first half collectively, it would be deemed above. Again, this is our outage severity metric that we've created. So it's our statistic that we track. But when you track it back to 2010, first half has been above that average, long-term average.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. And, Aaron, I just wonder, on a bigger picture, longer-term basis on home standby, the install base continues to grow. At some point, these reach end of useful life, and you start entering more of a replacement cycle for that install base. Any sense as to kind of where we are in that and does it help you any with the underlying growth right now or is still just too early in the install base of those cutting over still too small? (39:38-39:44)
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Charley, we've often said the useful life of the products are between 15 and 20 years, if they're well maintained. And they're like a furnace or other connected home appliance or system. The category is about 20 years old now. We're coming up on what would be, roughly, the 20-year anniversary of really kind of launching it more mainstream. And we're starting to see, very small numbers, but we are seeing replacement numbers. We do track it. And every quarter that we go out and we track it, it ticks up a little bit. And at some point, it'll be something maybe more meaningful, but today, it's still very early. I do think that per my comments before, as we continue to innovate, the WiFi connectability feature that we added. We've heard from some certain customers, that they really desire that feature. And if they have an older product, even if it's not at end of life, they may be considering an upgrade because that's an important feature for them. And some of the older products just don't have that capability, not at least cost-effectively. So I think that things like that, as we innovate around the category, introduce new features like WiFi connectability, that also should maybe speed up some of that replacement cycle that I think that is out there in the future for us.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yes.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Charley.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Morning, Brian.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: And, obviously, great work managing through this step-up in demand. First question, just on the Florida and Puerto Rico impact from last year, and I'm just thinking about how you talk about impact from major events and trying to gauge, now that you're looking back on the demand, the incremental demand, that you saw from these events, how big has it been? I'm trying to gauge it relative to that $50 million that you talk about for a major event.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Well, it's hard to correlate exactly a sale in 2018 back to an event in 2017, but...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: You could take Florida as an example. And, Brian, I think it's really hard. We've tried to do this internally, because obviously we want to be able to more accurately project the impact of different events. But the attribution analysis, if I can use the terminology, of trying to attribute a sale back to a particular single event is really difficult, right? So take Florida. We had Matthew come through and kind of skirt the coast the year before. So maybe some people lost power for a brief period of time, but that second event, which may have been Irene or some of the other storms that came through, was that the tipping point for somebody? I don't know. Do you attribute that back to a storm in 2017 or do you attribute it back to something before that? Same thing is true in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico had some power quality issues well before the hurricane activity last year. They had a bankrupt utility company serving the island, and so a lot of power quality issues that have plagued the island. And so was the active hurricane season with just the massive tragedy there of having power be out for so long, is that the attribution or is it all the other things added up? So I think it's really, really hard for us to say with any degree of certainty. So we really don't do that because we can look at what activations do year-over-year and we can see regionally that the Southeast is up very nicely over last year. We can see the Northeast is up as well. We know that those increases are due to an acceleration of penetration in those markets because of the specific major events or specific events that have occurred, but it's really hard to kind of attribute that at any local level.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, and I think to clarify, like when we say in our prepared comments, we say an "average" event could impact our sales positively by $50 million, that is meant for that year. So for that year, it could impact the forecast for that year's guidance by $50 million for an average event. What you do have, though, is that you have infinitely higher sales of home standby, because you have a new and higher baseline that's established in the following years. Just to compare, so Irma, there was roughly 7 million to 8 million people without power for a week, call it, down in Florida and Georgia. So that was probably an above average major event. I think we even called out in our prepared comments, that if we don't get a major event this year, that we would have a 4% headwind in growth, strictly just from portable sales that we sold in the second half of 2017. So that's roughly $60 million to $70 million right there. So just in portables alone in 2017, was $65 million. And then you get the home standby on top of that and you get the new and higher baseline. So again, it's a tough question to answer, Brian, but hopefully, we're giving you some color there.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, no, that's all helpful in thinking about it. And I guess following on to that question, if you look at the second half of the year, you made the comment that you – I believe that you said you expect home standby sales in the second half of 2018 to be up year-over-year. Can you make a broader comment on the residential segment for the second half year-over-year? Can you grow for the whole segment?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Well, you've got the portable headwind, which is going to be, in the absence of another event, I think we're really pleased with, obviously, the strength that portables have displayed so far this year. And as our prepared remarks around home standby, as you noted, we said it was going to actually be up in the back half of the year, which was not the original guide. I mean, there's still a fair amount of port gens that we have to comp against in --
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, and having said that, I mean, our new products that we're launching...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Definitely help.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: The shelf space that we won is helping to offset some of that.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: To neutralize that, yeah, for sure.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: But resi's going to be good for the second half.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, a lot better than we thought.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then I don't know if you guys can make any comment, if there's any update on what you're seeing in the regulatory environment or any changes potentially coming for assisted living facilities more broadly outside of Florida. Is there any momentum in that area?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: There's a couple of states that are reviewing it, Brian, and I think on the back of what Florida did. We still believe that there's probably an opportunity at a national level to improve the regulations. The HVAC loads, the air conditioning and heating loads, really are the issue that are central to the changes Florida made by adding a livable temperature range around their regulations. And so by doing that, in effect, they've made the HVAC loads deemed critical in that regulation. And so we have seen a couple of other states, Oklahoma has a proposal out there. There's a couple others where there's some talk, but beyond that, we think maybe others are probably going to wait for the next national code cycle, which is a three-year cycle. So it'd be coming up in the next couple of years. And I think it's something that all states should consider, and certainly at a national level should be considered, given the risks associated with not having temperature control available when power is out.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Brian.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning, guys.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Ross.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, your full-year guidance implies, I think, like $380 million in EBITDA, and you just did $170 million or so in the first half, and you did $100 million or so in Q2. So I mean, you're basically just a little over $100 million a quarter for the next two quarters, and I just went back and looked. I mean, other than, what was it, 2013 or 2014, I mean, your EBITDA goes up every single year in Q2 to Q3. I mean, Q2 is not typically a seasonal high point. I mean, I get the whole portable issue, but it just doesn't seem like, given the strength of the environment right now, I mean, you guys aren't baking in any second half improvement from where you are in Q2. So could you talk to that a little bit?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, it's a fair comment, Ross, because we looked at it as well. So second quarter, we had a very strong second quarter, and a lot of demand, and we're executing on that demand. So Q2, from a normal seasonality perspective, Q2 was just higher than it normally is. Again, you'd expect that after a major event in the previous year. And so we expect that strength to continue into the second half. But you're right. It's going to be, because of such a strong second quarter, our guidance anticipates that the second half quarterly run rate would be more level-loaded off that second quarter run rate. We don't have a major event in the second half that we're assuming. We also are just assuming just normalized long-term average baseline outages. So I think we say that there's always could be some upside there. But basically, the assumption is that the strength from Q2 will carry into the third and fourth quarter. But could we get some extra weather that we could exceed that? Yes. Extra, more outage environment, yes, we could exceed that.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Even if you don't get extra weather, I mean, isn't this just a natural progression? Like I said, I mean, I think 2015, in the middle of an industrial recession, your EBITDA went up pretty substantially from Q2 to Q3. I don't remember exactly what was going on that year, if there was an outage or not. But it would seem like you don't even necessarily need a major power outage for the third quarter to be higher. It just seems like that's what it usually does.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, again, on the back of a major event, second quarter is always very strong. You'd have to look back to, what, 2013. You'd have to look back and --
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, usually you don't have that same ramp that you have.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: That you're referring to some of those other periods, Ross. But it's just a little bit different pacing this year as a result of that. And I think we're reflecting that in our guidance.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Can you talk about the telecom improvement? I mean, I think that's a pretty consolidated customer base, and I think you're talking about a handful of customers. Is it really just one customer that's been out of the market for a long time that's driving that improvement? And remind us or give us some sense as to how far below prior peak that business is now? And what portion of C&I, just very, very roughly, does it account for?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Ross, we don't comment specifically on our individual customers' plans, but there are a number of customers. I would say you're right. The market, there's a fair amount of consolidation, but there are still a number of major players there. And I would say some of those major players have been advancing the hardening of their networks, as we refer to it, relative to protecting them from outages. And it's an investment cycle. It does cycle. We've seen it as high – as we said before, it was a meaningful part of our C&I business back in the 2013 and 2014 time period. And it has done that before, even prior to us being a public company. We have been serving this market for nearly 30 years now. So we see cycles. And it feels to us like we're in the early stages of another investment cycle here. Some of that is being spurred by 5G investment. Some of it is simply the need to continue to protect these networks. As more and more critical communications go across wireless networks, making sure those networks are backed up and making sure they're protected is beyond just the simple annoyance of not being able to make a phone call. I mean, there's a lot of critical data and voice that's going across these networks and I think the network operators themselves would tell you that aside from that, it's the lost revenue opportunity of being down with an outage. Outages are a fact of life. I was amazed. I was watching a baseball game the other night and there was a half hour power outage at Dodger Stadium. And just clear blue sky and power goes out. And these things happen. They take down the networks, the telecom networks, around them the same way they do the lights in a stadium. So, that provides for a very serious problem, obviously, for first responders and other people who really depend on those networks for just the critical nature of them.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: What are your electrical contractor customers asking you to do in terms of product development? I mean, you guys have got this like massive market share of home standby generators. And you've been adding new features for years to make the product more value added and so forth, but there's got to be a lot of other things that you can sell through that channel. I mean, your acquisition strategy has been mostly focused on diversifying C&I, and it's paying off nicely, at least it looks like. But is there an opportunity for you guys to make acquisitions in residential and ancillary products where you can leverage that very unique distribution channel you have with all these small contractors?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great question and one that we've debated internally here. I think, obviously, one of the strengths of our residential business is that network. And we've invested heavily in that network, in terms of training them on the home standby category, how to sell it, how to install it, how to service it, how to monetize it in preventative maintenance contracts and things down the line. And we've talked a lot about are there other product categories that we could put into that channel that could become an acquisition target. And frankly, what we struggled with in that kind of thought process is diluting their focus on the opportunity that is residential standby. It's such a small penetration rate today, and there's so much opportunity we believe to continue to grow that. It's almost like we don't want to introduce something that could dilute their focus. A lot of our dealers, a lot of our contractors are small, one and two-man teams. And so their bandwidth, their capacity to add other things is somewhat limited, actually. I mean, right now, in particular, they're very busy with new housing construction being on the rebound. There's a lot of remodeling going on. There's no shortage of potential projects for them to work on. And, in fact, it's the inverse. There's actually a labor shortage. There's less people going into the contractor trades today. So I think we're being very sensitive and very careful about not diluting their focus by introducing a number of other products. Now, if we came across something that had margin profiles similar to where we're at today with home standby and something that we felt just was a can't miss kind of thing, obviously, we'd look at it, but nothing to this point has crossed our radar that would shake us from the path that we're on there.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: You bet, Ross.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Aaron Jagdfeld for closing remarks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to reporting our third quarter 2018 earnings results, which we anticipate will be sometime in early November. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-05-02 09:00:00) =====

Analysts: Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2018 Generac Holdings Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mike Harris, Vice President of Finance. Sir, please go ahead.
Michael W. Harris - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2018 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Overall, first quarter results provided a great start to 2018, with robust year-over-year organic sales growth leading to strong improvements in margins and cash flow. Specifically, overall net sales increased 20% compared to the prior year, with core sales growth of approximately 17% when excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency. This sales growth drove an overall 230 basis point improvement in gross profit margin, 400 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin, and a significant improvement in operating and free cash flow as compared to the prior year. The fundamental demand environment for residential home standby and portable generators continued to expand, benefiting from another quarter of elevated power outages, which contributed to strong growth in both in-home consultations and end-user activations. Shipments of domestic (00:02:15) commercial and industrial products also experienced significant growth during the quarter driven mainly by the ongoing replacement cycle for mobile products. Sales once again grew organically within the International segment, which resulted in a year-over-year improvement in margins as well. Additionally, with the improving demand trends in several of our end markets, we were opportunistic buyers of Generac shares during the quarter investing $26 million under our current buyback program. First quarter results continue to benefit from the increased awareness of the home standby product category, primarily from the afterglow demand generated by the active 2017 hurricane season and elevated baseline outage activity experienced during the prior year. Accordingly, shipments of home standby generators during the first quarter increased significantly compared to the prior year. In addition, baseline power outage activity remained strong during the first quarter of 2018 from a series of storms that impacted the northeast region and led to a peak of nearly 5 million utility customers without power. Importantly, the higher outage environment in recent quarters is allowing us to make further progress with optimizing our targeted marketing and PowerPlay in-home selling solution to generate more sales leads, improve close rates and engaging new dealers. Increased awareness drove significant increases of in-home consultations or IHCs, as we call them, during the quarter, a good leading indicator of future home standby demand. And we also saw an all-time high in the overall count of residential dealers at the end of the quarter. In addition, end user activations for home standby generators remained very strong during the quarter with activity in the southeast and northeast regions growing substantially compared to the prior year levels. Shipments of portable generators also grew substantially compared to prior year and were higher than expected due to the northeast storm activity, and benefited additionally from retail channel replenishment resulting from the elevated outage environment experienced in recent quarters. Demand for domestic (00:04:05) mobile products, primarily serving the rental markets, continued to experience a strong recovery. Recall that we started to see the beginning of a strong cyclical rebound in this market last year after the severe downturn experienced during 2015 and 2016 and this continued during the first quarter of 2018, with significant year-over-year growth in shipments. Additionally, new orders for these products further accelerated during the quarter with optimism around a continued fleet refresh cycle, the prospects of an oil and gas market rebound and tax reform impacts, all contributing to the increased demand. We continue to believe the current fleet replacement cycle is primarily being driven by the overall age of existing rental equipment with oil and gas related capital spending still in the early stages of recovery. However, with oil prices further rising in recent months, we believe a meaningful recovery in the purchase of mobile equipment for use in the domestic (00:04:52) energy sector could begin to gain traction. Also, utilization rates for several of the product categories hit hardest during the oil and gas downturn continue to trend favorably, which gives us confidence that the mobile products category may have further room to grow in the future. Shipments of stationary C&I products in North America during the first quarter were up slightly as compared to the prior year. However, we expect improving year-over-year growth trends in the near-term given strong project quotation levels and order trends experienced so far in 2018. Historically, major outage events and periods of elevated baseline activity have been a catalyst for our domestic (00:05:26) C&I products by increasing the awareness of having backup power for businesses, institutions and other critical infrastructure. In the past several months, we have begun to see early signs of interest resuming in the telecom market as certain national account customers are placing more importance on protecting the uptime of their wireless networks. Also, during the first quarter, the state of Florida passed legislation requiring the nursing homes and assisted living facilities have sufficient backup power to maintain safe environmental temperatures for a minimum number of days following a utility outage. We are currently engaged directly with several national account customers on a number of projects as well as working with our distributors, dealers and wholesale channel partners on developing a pipeline of opportunities with other long-term care providers in the state. While still in the early stages, we are optimistic about the potential for incremental business in the coming quarters as a result of this new regulation. In addition to a strong domestic (00:06:16) market, our International segment once again experienced solid organic sales growth of approximately 5% and margin expansion of 70 basis points as compared to the prior year first quarter. We remain encouraged by the ongoing improvement in the financial performance of our international (00:06:29) businesses, which have demonstrated attractive broad-based core sales growth over the past several quarters. Importantly, the International segment has also expanded margins on a year-over-year basis in each of the past three quarters due to a variety of factors, most notably from the improved sales mix and leverage of fixed manufacturing and operating expenses on the higher sales volumes. We believe these favorable trends in financial performance will continue throughout 2018 as we focus on gaining market share in the regions around the world where we operate as well as further optimizing the margin profile of these businesses. Recall that in February we announced the signing of a purchase agreement to acquire Selmec. Founded 1941 and headquartered in Mexico City, Selmec is a leading designer and manufacturer of diesel and gaseous fuel industrial generators ranging from 10 kilowatts to 2.75 megawatts. We believe Selmec's experience in standby energy solutions, specifically for telecom, data center and other mission critical applications, is an excellent complementary fit within Generac's Latin American strategy. In addition, Selmec offers a market leading service platform and specialized engineering capabilities together with well-developed integration, project management and remote monitoring services that provide for higher margins. Acquiring Selmec should allow us to dynamically scale our existing Ottomotores business, leveraging both the distribution and operational footprints of the combined businesses to offer the Latin American market a broader portfolio of products and solutions. The specific date for closing this transaction is still undetermined pending regulatory approval, but is likely to occur during the second quarter of 2018. Importantly, once closed, we will include Selmec in our guidance, which is expected to be accretive to the International segment's margins and only slightly dilutive on a consolidated basis. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to York to provide further details on our first quarter results. York?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Aaron. Before discussing first quarter results in more detail, I'd like to point out that effective January 1, 2018, Generac adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard that all companies are required to follow. For comparability purposes, the full retrospective method was elected under this standard, which requires application to all periods presented, and the prior-year first quarter of 2017 results that we are discussing this morning have been restated accordingly. However, the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Now looking at our first quarter results in more detail, net sales for the quarter increased organically 20.3% to $397.6 million, as compared to $330.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Core sales growth, which also excludes the impact of foreign currency, was approximately 17% over the prior year. Looking at our consolidated net sales by product class, residential product sales during the first quarter increased 23.5% to $190.5 million as compared to $154.2 million in the prior year quarter. As Aaron mentioned, the quarter saw strong growth in shipments of both home standby and portable generators as end market demand for these products continues to be robust as a result of the elevated power outage environment. Looking at our commercial industrial (sic) [commercial and industrial] (00:09:35) products, net sales for the first quarter of 2018 increased 16.2% to $175.1 million as compared to $150.8 million in the prior quarter, with core sales growth being approximately 11%. This core growth was primarily generated by very strong shipments of [ph] domestic (00:09:54) mobile products driven by the continued fleet replacement cycle from our rental account customers. In addition, our International segment, which is predominantly C&I related, benefited from nice organic growth from our Pramac, Ottomotores and Motortech businesses. Net sales for the other products (00:10:11) category, primarily made up of service parts, increased 25.5% to $32 million as compared to $25.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. This strong growth was primarily due to increased demand for replacement parts, as a result of the elevated level of power outage activity experienced during recent quarters as the installed base of our products continues to grow. Gross profit margin expanded 230 basis points to 35.2% compared to 32.9% in the prior year first quarter. This attractive margin growth was driven by a more favorable pricing environment and a more favorable sales mix relative to prior year. The improved leverage of fixed manufacturing costs and the significantly higher organic sales volumes were mostly offset by higher commodity levels, resulting in costs being largely neutral to gross margins versus prior year. Operating expenses increased $5.7 million, or 7.4%, as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of net sales operating expenses excluding intangible amortization declined 180 basis points versus the prior year due to improved operating leverage on the higher organic sales volumes. The increase in operating expense dollars over the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in employee costs including higher incentive compensation recorded during the quarter and the impact from a stronger euro as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by lower promotional costs benefiting from the higher power outage environment, as well as lower intangible amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $70.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $45.7 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin, before deducting for non-controlling interests, was 18.1% in the quarter as compared to 14.1% in the prior year. This 400 basis point increase compared to the prior year was largely due to the previously mentioned improvement in gross profit margin and improved leverage of fixed operating expenses on the strong organic increase in sales. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 21.5% to $300.2 million as compared to $247.2 million in the prior year quarter. The current year first quarter results reflected strong growth in shipments of residential products as we executed on the demand that was generated by increased outage activity. In addition, C&I mobile products grew significantly as rental customers continued their fleet replacement cycle. Also contributing to the year-over-year sales growth were increases in service parts sales. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $65.5 million, or 21.8% of net sales, as compared to $41.9 million in the prior year, or 16.9% of net sales. International segment sales increased 16.9% to $97.4 million as compared to $83.3 million in the prior-year quarter, with core sales growth of approximately 5%. The overall growth compared to the prior year was primarily due to the favorable impact of the stronger euro along with broad-based organic growth from the Pramac, Ottomotores and Motortech businesses. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment, before deducting for non-controlling interests, improved to $6.3 million, or 6.5% of net sales, as compared to $4.8 million, or 5.8% of net sales in the prior year. Now, switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2018 on a consolidated basis, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $33.6 million as compared to $12.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in operating income just discussed together with a lower GAAP tax rate contributed to this increase. GAAP income taxes during the first quarter of 2018 were $11.4 million or a 25.3% effective tax rate as compared to $7.8 million or a 39.1% tax rate for the prior year. The large decline in the GAAP tax rate is primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, which became effective starting with the first quarter of 2018. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.42 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.20 in the prior year. The specific calculations of these earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release. Note that current year earnings per share were impacted by a $7.7 million adjustment to increase the value of the redeemable non-controlling interest for the Pramac acquisition, resulting in a $0.12 reduction in GAAP earnings per share. Under U.S. GAAP accounting rules any adjustments to the redemption value are recorded directly to retained earnings. However, the redemption value adjustments are required to be reflected in the earnings per share calculation. Adjusted net income for the company as defined in the earnings release was $46.1 million in the current year quarter versus $24.7 million in the prior year. The significant sales growth and improved operating margins just discussed were the primary drivers of this increase. With regards to cash income taxes, the first quarter of 2018 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $5.4 million as compared to $3.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The current year cash taxes reflect an anticipated cash income tax rate of approximately 13% for the full year 2018 while the prior year first quarter was based on a cash tax rate of 15% for the full year 2017. The current year cash tax rate benefits from a lower effective tax rate as a result of the Tax Reform Act, partially offset by a higher level of pre-tax earnings anticipated for the full year 2018. As a reminder, our favorable tax shield (00:16:16) of approximately $30 million through annual intangible amortization in our tax return results in our cash tax rate being notably lower than our GAAP income tax rate of between 25% to 26% for 2018. Adjusted diluted net income per share for the company, as reconciled in our earnings release, was $0.74 per share for the current year quarter compared to $0.39 for the prior year. Cash flow from operations was $29 million as compared to a negative $5.2 million in the prior year first quarter and free cash flow was $23.3 million as compared to negative $8.1 million in the same quarter last year. The improvements in cash flow were driven by a variety of factors including the increase in operating earnings as compared to the prior year and lower working capital usage during the current year quarter, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. As of March 31, 2018, we had a total of approximately $940 million of outstanding debt and $146 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $794 million. Out net debt leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2.4 times on an as-reported basis, a healthy decline from 3.7 times as compared to the same period last year and compared to 2.5 times at the end of 2017. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, there was approximately $234 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. Finally, we repurchased 560,000 shares of our common stock during the first quarter for $25.7 million under our current share repurchase program. Under the program, a total of $250 (00:17:55) million of common stock was authorized for repurchase over a 24-month period. And to-date, a total of 2.7 million shares of common stock have been repurchased for approximately $106 million. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our improved outlook for 2018.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, York. We are raising our guidance for revenue growth for full year 2018, as we now expect net sales to improve between 6% to 8% over the prior year, which is an increase from the 3% to 5% growth previously forecasted. Recall that the second half of 2017 included elevated portable generator shipments from the active hurricane season. With no major outages assumed in our current 2018 guidance, we estimate there is an approximately 4% growth headwind relative to this strong prior year comparison. Core organic sales growth is now expected to be between 5% to 6%, which is an increase from the previous guidance of 2% to 3%. This increase is primarily due to improving end-market conditions for both domestic (00:18:53) residential and C&I products. Importantly, as previously mentioned, this guidance does not include the Selmec acquisition and does not include any impacts from major power outage activity for the remainder of the year. Our top-line guidance also assumes no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment and a baseline power outage severity level for the remainder of the year, similar to that of the longer term average. Should the baseline power outage environment in 2018 continue to be higher or if there is a major outage event during the year, it is likely that we could exceed these expectations. For historical perspective, an average major power outage event could result in $50 million or more of additional sales depending on a number of variables. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year 2018, before adjusting for non-controlling interests, are still expected to be between 19% to 19.5%. This guidance assumes a benefit from improved operating leverage on higher core sales growth and cost savings from our profitability enhancement program, both which are largely expected to be offset by additional inflationary pressures and to a lesser extent unfavorable sales mix. Consistent with historical seasonality, we expect sales and EBITDA margins in the second half of the year to be higher relative to the first half. However, given the improved overall demand environment entering 2018, the increase in second half sales and margins are not expected to be as pronounced when compared to the first half. Specifically, regarding the pacing of net sales, the remaining quarters of the year are expected to be more level-loaded relative to normal seasonality, with the quarterly run rate in the second half of the year only modestly higher relative to the second quarter. For full year 2018, operating and free cash flow generation is still expected to be strong and follow historical seasonality, benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow, which is expected to be over 90% for the full year. In addition, we are providing an update on certain other guidance details to help model the company's earnings per share and cash flows for full year 2018. Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $44 million, given the current rising interest rate environment. Stock compensation expense is now expected to increase to approximately $13 (00:20:59) million for the year. Additionally, as a result of the expected improved earnings outlook, cash taxes are now anticipated to be approximately $29.5 million to $31.5 million, which translates into a full year 2018 cash income tax rate of approximately 13%. The remaining guidance items we discussed during the last call are not expected to change. Lastly, it's worth noting that we achieved organic sales growth of 11% during 2017 as several areas of our business began to recover throughout the year. As discussed this morning, certain key end markets have further strengthened relative to our initial guidance. We believe these favorable tailwinds and the positive top-line momentum in our business positions us to achieve continued attractive sales growth and overall financial performance for 2018. While it's clear that we'll have to navigate through an inflationary environment as the year progresses, we believe the robust demand environment for our products will continue to provide for improved operating leverage in the business and also gives us increasing confidence in our outlook for the year. This concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Charlie Brady with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: All right, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, good morning.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, with regard to the portable products in the rental channel, can you just talk a little bit more about kind of where you see it as far as the aging (00:22:36) equipment and how long you think that replacement cycle has to go? It's been going on for a while now, sounds like it's continuing to be pretty strong and it sounds like you're not seeing really expansion yet. It's really all driven by replacement. Can you please speak to that a little bit?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think, obviously, Charlie, it's a great question and we ask that of ourselves and our teams here on our mobile products business a lot, because trying to gauge just – we know it's a cyclical business. We know there's a lot of variables that go into what drives the cycle, everything from fleet replacement to strengthen (00:23:08) construction, both road and commercial to – as we've called out the domestic (00:23:12) energy production sector where – I get to answer your question directly that fleet replacement cycle we keep referring to, I would say last year we were obviously early in that cycle. The equipment age (00:23:23) there'd been a period of a couple of years there in 2015 and 2016, where in particular our national account customers have kind of hit the pause button on capital spending. And so, what that did is it deferred kind of the normal – we generally would see with a lighting tower or a generator, about a fifth of the fleet turnover every year. But the average lifecycle on (00:23:45) those products, four to five years, something like that. Little bit longer for certain customers, little shorter for others, but call it roughly 20% of the fleet would turnover every year. So if you go two years with low capital purchases, clearly there were some pent up demand there. We saw that snap back pretty hard last year. That was kind of the early innings of the recovery. What we've been very pleased though is throughout the beginning of this year and really even as we enter the second quarter here, we've been very surprised with just how strong it's remained. And so, then you asked a question what drives that, is it still the refresh cycle or is it something more? And we keep thinking that oil and gas is going to start playing a role in the equipment purchases there, but frankly we look at the utilization rates kind of in the specialty rental channels where a lot of that equipment goes. And the utilization rates are starting to recover. They're not fully where they are in the general rental business though. So we still think that there's legs with the rebound, in particular as it relates to oil and gas. And I would say we're probably middle innings on the fleet refresh cycle. So I think we're pretty bullish on that business overall. And in fact a part of our lift on the guidance this morning is related to mobile products.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. That's helpful. And just with regard to the Florida legislation, just to be clear, is your guidance factoring in any strength or sales coming out of that legislation yet?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, so we actually – we had kind of a line of sight on this from late last year after the storm. So actually our February guidance, our full year guidance that we gave initially did include some lift. And again, as we said in the prepared remarks, historically whenever you get an active hurricane season like we had last year, typically that bodes well for our C&I business. It's a longer sales cycle. There's planning, there's permitting, there's budgeting, and so you don't see the visceral reaction you get in the residential market. The C&I market generally will be several quarters afterwards before it kind of lights up and we're starting to see that now. But we did have to be clear. We did have some of that Florida legislation pending. It was pending legislation at that point. We had it in our guidance in February, but we took it up for the remainder of the year. Once it became clear that that was going to become law, which it did, and now as we've started to really have some serious conversations with both partners at the national level, people who own and operate those facilities on a national level, but also, I mean, frankly, it's a very fragmented market. There are a lot of facilities, a lot of small facilities across the state and so it's a lot of conversations. There's a lot of engineering work to be done. We found that we can be very useful and helpful in providing a lot of that engineering work and connecting those firms to resources whether they be our industrial distributors. But I think the other advantage we may have there is that because of our broad approach to the market from a distribution standpoint with electrical contractors as well as wholesalers and other channel partners, I think in particular the small bed facilities may not buy from an industrial distributor. They may end up buying from a smaller – their needs are smaller. They're looking for a smaller product. They can just as easily get that product direct from an electrical contractor who could be a dealer of ours. So we've opened up the product offering to those channel partners in a way that I think puts us in a position to see some nice lift from that and that's what we included in our upward (00:27:13) guidance this morning.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, and just one more from me. On just the inventory level (00:27:18) the replacement of the portables obviously from the sell out in Q1 storms, where is that level today? It's back to normal or it's still being replaced?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: We've been constantly trying to catch up really since the hurricane season and the amount of portable generators that we put in the market over the last several quarters, it's amazing. I mean, we're running flat out in our facility here in Jefferson, Wisconsin. We've got our supply chain ramped up very hard. But every time we think we're getting ahead of it, then we get one successive storm after another in the northeast in the month of March. So really where I would say if we were to kind of quantify where inventories are at today, at least from a qualitative standpoint, they're low in channel and they're low in our own warehouses. Now, we're replenishing and we're coming into a very critical part of the season here in Q2 where what we've historically seen happen is that people, they'll get a lot of confidence in ordering for the upcoming season if they've had a good season last year. And so, we would expect some pretty strong order patterns here in Q2 and our guidance reflects that around portable gens and really probably even into Q3. But we're scrambling (00:28:35) to get stock and we're building as much as we can and it's good to see that market come back and we went through a period of protracted low outages and seeing it come back to this level. We've also been successful in getting a little more market share this year. Line reviews (00:28:52) are coming out right now and we're starting to kind of calibrate ourselves around some of the wins that we got. On a net basis, we're up year-over-year. We're going to be up. It's really a question of timing around when those products get placed, are they placed ahead of season, in season or after season? So we're working with the major retail partners now, but we're – on a net plus there, we're pretty bullish on (00:29:12). Our performance last year really led us to the point of winning some additional business this year. So that's a net positive.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, so just on – I guess, as you assess Irma and some of the hurricanes last year, what are you seeing relative to expectations on home standby follow through in your carry over? And then, just any early feedback that you're getting also on home standby, visibility activity from some of these East Coast storms? Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, so obviously the active season last year, Jeff, as we had said in particular, I think we made the comment, I believe is on our fourth quarter call, that we had never seen in-home consultation levels that we saw after those storms and that's a big leading indicator for us and what we weren't sure of is just how that would translate in follow through here in the first half of certainly the first quarter of 2018. We've been really happy with that. And I will say this when you look at it regionally, obviously, we said in the prepared remarks that activations in the southeast and northeast are up dramatically year-over-year. There's a couple of regions like the Midwest where because of the really poor weather conditions really through – I'll be honest. I think the snow just melted here a couple of days ago in Wisconsin, but the really tough weather conditions in particular in the upper Midwest, have made it difficult to put products on ground. And so, activations were a little bit more muted in the Midwest region in the first quarter. But even in the last few weeks we're starting to see that come back pretty aggressively. So we are really bullish that the spillover effect of a very active hurricane season in 2017 is going to continue to drive the regions that were directly impacted by that. But then also we also see this kind of afterglow effect around the rest of the regions. And then, more specifically your question about the northeast, again I see the in-home consultations are elevated and they've remained so. It's been a great test of our PowerPlay selling systems. I mean, the amount of dollars we're putting through that system, the amount of quotations, the visibility that we're getting to not only individual dealer performance, but regional performance around win rates and around just raw activity going into the areas really gives us a lot of confidence, and again is a big part of the overall story in raising our guidance, and dealer count also being up all-time high here at the end of the quarter. Those are all good things for us and I think they're directly related to the higher outage environment. So we're very bullish on it, Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. And just one more. Margins seem – certainly were better than my model and maybe that speaks to home standby mix, but I noticed with the revenue change you're not changing your EBITDA margin. Just talk about puts and takes there and (00:32:25) any contingency or conservatism in the guide around that? Thanks.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Jeff this is York. So on the margin guide, we did hold our margins to that 19% to 19.5% EBITDA range for the full year. And as you can imagine with where steel is going and in all those discussion about the uncertainty with tariffs and the weaker U.S. dollar that we're experiencing in (00:32:54) wage pressures and whatever it – there's lot of inflationary pressures that a lot of companies are experiencing. So we've evaluated that we've included some incremental inflationary pressures relative to the previous guide, but the operating leverage we're getting by adding roughly $50 million in sales to our guidance, which is that extra 3%, is really helping it to offset that. So I think we're pleased that we're able to hold that margin guidance despite some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning, guys. I apologize if you've addressed this (00:33:41). I just jumped on from another call. But your ability to raise prices in home standby, Aaron, in this environment and in C&I, can you – due to – (00:33:53) to compensate for higher input cost, can you address that a little bit?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. It's obviously a question on, I think, the minds of anybody who's running company today (00:34:03) with the inflationary pressures we're seeing. We went to the market with some price earlier this year. There's kind of an annual cadence around C&I, so I'll start with that market. C&I is – the lot of the major players in that industry will come out at the beginning of the year or at the end of the previous year with couple percentage points of price. What we've seen on top of that kind of normal cadence and we followed suit with that kind of in December-January. We've seen now some of the major players in that industry, in the C&I space come back and they're taking a second bite at the apple here. And we're evaluating how we want to do that. Obviously, we know that these input costs are going to continue to rise, but at the same time we like our position as one of the value providers in the marketplace. I think we're going to end up having to do something there and are evaluating kind of what that would look like on the C&I side. Residential is interesting. One of the things we talk about residential is the importance of affordability. Affordability is kind of an important leg of the stool when it comes to growing the penetration rate for home standby. That being said, straight price increases, typically you (00:35:20) don't take the same model and just layer on the price increase. We generally take a different tact when it comes to residential products and in particular home standby. This year, as an example, the way we approached price, we have a new model that's just now coming off the production line and starting to get into the marketplace. It's a model that has Wi-Fi connectivity as standard in every product, and there's obviously there's a bit of a cost for that and, obviously, we've worked hard to offset some of that cost, but there's still net cost. But that coupled with the inflationary pressures of materials, wage inflation and other things, we went and recalibrated our entire product line based on some of these new features in the new product line with a different price. So that has a different price point going into the market. We still think that there's a lot of value for homeowners, and we think that in particular some of the additional features we've given people like the connectivity are quite valuable. So, in that case, that was a way to get price in the market, was to introduce new products and new innovative features. What we have to evaluate, which I think is your question is, do we go back again. Now that (00:36:23) the inflation, we can get a better line of sight on what's going on, in particular with some of the tariff discussion and other things. We just are kind of waiting to see what's going to happen there. We may need to go again. But I guess, on the one hand, everybody in our industry has the same kind of concerns, right? Everybody uses a lot of steel, aluminum and copper when you build a generator. And many of us have similar supply chains in terms of where the sourcing comes from. So I look at that, and I say, boy that – if inflationary pressures rise that fast then we'll have to address what price we may have to go after again a second time. I don't think there's any question that we'd be able to get that. I think we've got a lot of cover for that, talking to our customers, our distribution partners. They understand that they're seeing their own businesses in a lot of different ways. So I think unfortunately where all this is going to manifest is probably higher prices at the street level at the end of the day.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks, Aaron. And then, in holding your EBITDA margin guide, you were saying that operating leverage can offset raw materials, I think, amongst (00:37:31) some other comments, but are you making any assumptions on weather patterns in the second half of the year when you say that or do you – is the operating leverage you're counting on basically in your order book right now?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think – so the operating leverage as we remarked in our comments, has really calibrated around the upward guide that we did this morning. So kind of on that level. I will say this on your comment about weather and how much of that do (00:38:03) we have baked into our guide. So this is the thing with this business that I've always said is pretty – it's kind of an interesting element of our business and that we don't include any major events in our guidance. So there could be additional leverage. There could be additional top-line. As we said, a major event can add upwards of $50 million or more into the top-line. I'll also say this, the baseline power outage environment, which is an important kind of item that we use to calibrate the remainder of the year kind of view on residential, we're picking a level that's closer to the long-term average, quite a bit below where it's been, specifically well below where it was in Q1. So we were actually saying in our guidance this morning that we're looking for a lower power outage environment for the balance of the year and that yet still translated to a higher guide, an increase in our guidance. So is that upside? I don't know. We're trying to take a conservative approach to how we forecast outages. We've been down this road before. We just don't know when they're going to happen or where they're going to happen. We do know over the long-term, they do happen and they do impact that business. So we leave it to you guys and to others who watch the company to kind of pick a point on a curve and say where you're going to be. But that would only be an additional tailwind in terms of additional leverage from a margin standpoint.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you, Aaron.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. This is (00:39:41) for Jerry.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Unknown Speaker: Good morning. Can you please frame where the mobile genset business is relative to the 2014 oil and gas peak? And what's the lead time on orders today and how much you expect production to ramp in the second half of the year?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, so they're good questions. 2014 was a very unique year with not only the fleet refresh cycle kind of in the late innings, but also oil and gas. So we're still off of that peak. And in particular, as I mentioned before, we really haven't seen utilization rates in those specialty rental markets that serve oil and gas. We haven't seen them kind of hit their stride yet. So we believe there's room to run yet as it relates specifically to oil and gas. So the product lines that we serve that market with, both the specialty lighting towers, the specialty gas and diesel generators for that market and heaters, really have not come back to the levels, nowhere near what they were in 2014 for those specific product categories. As far as lead times for products, they are starting to stretch. We've always said that that's a business – the mobile products business, you want to have some inventory on the ground, because projects come up time and again you want to be able to capitalize when a project does happen, a new project hits the street. Unfortunately, what we're seeing is lead times are going out because there isn't – we're running three shifts in our factory there. I wouldn't say we're approaching full utilization, but we're pretty close in terms of capacity at our facility there. But actually our biggest constraint is engine availability. So the world market for the diesel engines that go into products like that, smaller displacement diesel engines also go into the same type of small construction equipment. And so, skid-steers and backhoes and things like that, which also obviously is a very robust demand environment right now. And so, that's putting pressure on the major engine manufacturers and they're obviously recalibrating their own factory scheduling to fix that. But fortunately we got in early. We could see this happening and we've been down this road before in terms of cycles and I think we're in pretty decent shape with engine supply. We've taken some additional steps there, but we're flat out trying to make as much product as we can, but lead times are going out.
Unknown Speaker: Great (00:42:02). Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning. And congrats on a great start to the year.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Brian.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Brian.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey. Is there any way that you could size that Florida opportunity with the assisted living facilities? Is it closer to $20 million or is this like a $50 million plus opportunity and does it carry into 2019? What's the timing do you think in the end around these guys becoming compliant with the regulation?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great question, Brian. I mean, we've done a lot of math on this, to try and quantify the size of the market opportunity there and there is a lot of factors that go into that. The existing facilities that are there, what do they already have? In some cases they already have some type of backup strategy and there's not a lot of great information when a facility has backup power versus not. Is that backup power adequate to carry (00:43:05) which is really the critical change to the legislation here that happened? But if we just kind of step back and we look at it, we would estimate the overall kind of size of the prize there including installation, and this is at a retail price point. It's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of a couple of hundred million dollars. Now, when you strip away the generator and transfer switch components of that at kind of wholesale levels, is that at $100 million to $125 million opportunity? That's probably a reasonable estimate. And then, you put a market share on that. We believe we should get our rightful share at a minimum and then maybe there's a little bit more because of the breadth of our distribution, because we have a better position with natural gas, which is also allowed under the regulation, which was a change from previous regulations. So I would say that if you were to size that, is it somewhere between – I think you hit the numbers, somewhere between $20 million and $50 million. In terms of timing, I think, it's interesting. There may be a problem with trying to get all that equipment built and installed by the state's deadline. Certainly, it's not going to happen by July 1. And then, there's extensions that the state has agreed to grant as long as facilities can show a credible plan to the state regulators, to AKA (00:44:24), as it's referred to in Florida, if they can show state regulators a credible plan, they'll give them a potential extension till the end of the year. We think that this is something that could kind of eclipse the full year and get into 2019 just simply because of the amount of the equipment. You've got to get permitting. Florida is a notoriously long cycle market when it comes to everything from a home standby to a C&I product. It just takes a long time to get permitting done, to get the contractors lined up and to get the work performed. And so, we believe that that could push this opportunity around the horn. We think our guidance appropriately reflects that and, again, some of our guidance had that, kind of this piece already in the initial full year for us in February, but we've raised that since because it's now become – obviously, it's very clear that this is a new law and it's going to have a positive impact, at least in our industry.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. That's obviously really helpful. I'm wondering just as you're going through the variables (00:45:28) calculation and you mentioned share, right. As I was looking at this, I'm trying to figure out do I use your C&I share or do I use your resi's share, and it seemed like you used a hybrid of those. If you get to something in between, around $35 million would be the midpoint of what you talked about and that would be something like 25%, 30% share. It sounds like I guess, we're leaning more towards the C&I share obviously, but will you use resi generators in some of these applications?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: So we can. The small bed facility (00:46:05) can certainly use a residential style generator. Because of that, Brian, we use a hybrid share number that we believe is reflective of where the larger facilities are going to use, very clearly a commercial industrial generator. Our shares is more akin to that. But then there are a lot of small bed facilities where we think a light commercial or a residential product could be used. And therefore, that's transacted through a much broader channel and we have a much greater share there. So you're right, we hybridized the share for the purposes of estimating the impact.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That's really helpful. And then, I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get you to quantify this, but if there's any way that you could help me think about this would be great, the baseline outage activity, and get (00:46:56) a sense for how you're constructing that guidance? How far above the long-term average has outage activity been, whatever period you choose, over the last 12 months would be helpful? I'm trying to get a sense for obviously how far it's dropping in your guidance (00:47:17).
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's a good question, Brian. I mean, we haven't quoted like specific numbers around that, but Q1 was meaningfully higher than the long-term average, really kind of think of it as double kind of the long-term average. And so, we're dropping it (00:47:32) based on the way we're guiding for the balance of the year, we're reverting more to that long-term average. Now obviously, we had a strong year last year, strong couple of quarters here. We strip out major events when we look at this, and we didn't qualify any of the events that occurred in Q1 as major, but it does bring the average up slightly when you look at the long-term, right. But it's still meaningfully below what happened in Q1 and meaningfully below what happened last year. So we think that maybe that indicates there's a sufficient conservatism in our guidance, but again because we don't know, you can't predict outages. We feel it's the proper way to do that.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Absolutely. Okay. And then one more, if I could. The Motortech, Pramac kind of update, if you give (00:48:19) a little more detail on how that's going in Europe, and I saw the 5% core number international, is that kind of going as expected so far?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: It is. Yeah, we've actually really, really pleased with our international businesses. The core growth rate in really all those acquisitions has done very well for us. Some of that is the strength of Europe overall. Some of it is some of the markets specifically like Motortech that are – they're focused on combined heat and power, OEMs and demand response OEMs and other gas power generation OEMs and that market is growing faster than traditional markets. Pramac has been just a tremendous grower for us, tremendous acquisition. And as we've said in these comments, our biggest area of focus with international businesses (00:49:16) is to improve the margins. But we knew we're buying eyes wide open. We went after this with a lot of vigor to give ourselves a much larger global footprint both from a distribution and manufacturing standpoint. And we knew that doing that was going to be dilutive on margins and we knew that in particular in (00:49:35) like a case like a Pramac or an Ottomotores, these companies are generally packagers of products. They're not true manufacturers I would say. They're really packagers. And what we are here in the U.S., the Generac, in particular our C&I business, which is what is most akin to these businesses, we're really a vertically integrated manufacturer. And so, there's a lot of value added work streams that we put into the product. Everything from manufacturing our own gas engines to winding our own alternators to engineering and designing our own controls, transfer switches, all of the components that are critical of the systems we think are really important. The key in these acquisitions has been in part of the thesis is to take and do that in these other businesses and then to leverage by growth to leverage there what is a relatively high fixed operating structure, because of the coverage that they have. So Pramac has 16 sales branches. These are offices with people staffed across the globe to get access to the 180 plus countries that they sell into. There's a high cost of that and the better that we can leverage that, and so we can improve – make improvements at the gross margin line by making them a better vertically integrated manufacturer. And then, we can improve at the bottom line by leveraging operating expense structure of these businesses by growing. And so, those have been the two things we've been very focused on and it's working. I mean, the last several quarters show it's working. We're seeing some nice improvements. And we have a long way to go. We said we want to double the EBITDA margins of these businesses. And we've got a line of sight to that. We think we have a solid plan to get there and we're working that plan and we've been on our trajectory.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: And gas work (00:51:23).
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: And focused on gas as well. It's been another area of positivity there.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions, and I'd like to turn the conference back over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Aaron Jagdfeld for closing remarks.

I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Overall, fourth quarter results provided a great end to 2017 as we experience record quarterly sales through strong core organic growth of approximately 13%. Overall, net sales increased 17% compared to the prior year when including the contribution from the Motortech acquisition and favorable foreign currency impacts. This sales growth translated into an overall 80 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin and 19% increase in EBITDA dollars, along with record quarterly levels of operating and free cash flow of $138 million and $122 million respectively. Home standby shipments during the fourth quarter grew strongly following the significant outage activity experienced during the second half of the year as the overall demand environment continue to be favorable. Shipments of C&I products were also significantly higher during the fourth quarter, driven by the continued recovery in domestic mobile products. In addition, very strong year-over-year organic sales growth was experienced within the international segment, which was leveraged into a substantial improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins. Given our strong earnings and cash flow for the year, we reduced our net leverage ratio to 2.5 times as compared to 3.6 times at the end of 2016, improving further on our financial position as we enter 2018. Awareness for home standby generators benefited from base line power outage activity that remained elevated during the fourth quarter, as well as the after goal demand from the significant hurricane activity during the third quarter. End user activations for home standby generators remained strong and broad based with activations in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico particularly elevated. Also the Northeast region continued to rebound and experienced double-digit growth for the first time in several years, benefiting from the increased outage activity during the quarter. With a favorable demand backdrop, our residential dealer base expanded to an all time high of approximately 5,700 dealers at the end of the year, and we expect this number to continue to grow over the next year. We were able to ramp production for home standby quickly, following the active storm season, allowing us to achieve near record levels of shipments for the category in the quarter. Shipments of portable generators were higher than expected due to strong replenishment activity following the hurricane activity during the third quarter, additional demand from Puerto Rico and the favorable base line outage environment experienced during the quarter. An area of our business that continues to experience a strong recovery is our domestic mobile products, primarily serving in our markets. After a fairly severe downturn in 2015 and 2016, demand continues to rebound quickly as we saw significant year-over-year growth in shipments during the fourth quarter. Additionally, new orders for domestic mobile products were robust one again during the quarter, resulting in significant backlog and improved visibility as we start 2018. Overall, stronger end market fundamentals due to optimism around the continued refresh cycle and oil and gas market rebound and tax reform impacts, all appear to be contributing to the increased demand. We continue to believe the current fleet replacement cycle is primarily being driven by the overall age of existing rental equipment with oil and gas related capital spending just now beginning to accelerate as we enter 2018. With oil prices improving significantly in recent month and trending in the low to mid $60 range, we believe a meaningful recovery in the purchase of mobile equipment for use in oil and gas related applications is starting to gain traction. Also, utilization rates for several of the product categories hit hardest during the oil and gas downturn continue to improve, which gives us confidence that further growth is ahead in mobile products category. We are currently in a process of further ramping up our supply chain and manufacturing capacity for the anticipated further increase in demand as we are bullish on this area of our business returning to sustainable long-term growth. Now let me provide some brief comments regarding the trends for our international segment, which had a fantastic fourth quarter with very strong organic sales growth. We were encouraged by the near doubling of margins during the quarter relative to prior year for this segment, which benefited from a variety of factors, most notably the improved leverage of fixed manufacturing and operating expenses on the considerably higher sales volumes. Within the international segment, Pramac continues to perform very well with strong sales growth during the fourth quarter and a solid expansion in margins as compared to the prior year. In addition to strength in shipments for both residential and C&I products across several European countries, the quarter also saw the benefit of favorable sales mix, including some large project activity with attractive margins. Our Ottomotores business, which serves the Latin American market, also experienced solid margin expansion during the fourth quarter through a variety of factors, including favorable sales mix and cost reduction initiatives. I would now like to share with you a few of our accomplishments from 2017. For the full year, net sales increased 16% to approximately $1.7 billion as compared to $1.4 billion in 2016, which included $70 million of sales from the Premac and Motortech acquisitions. Organic sales growth during 2017 was strong at 11%, which benefited from improving end market fundamentals in several areas of our business. Most notably, the growth in domestic residential products from the heightened power outage activity, the significant recovery and demand for our domestic mobile products and the strong organic sales growth experienced in the international segment. This organic sales growth was leveraged into strong year-over-year increases in adjusted EBITDA dollars and adjusted EPS, and we once again generated a robust level of free cash flow of $228 million. The growth in profitability and free cash flow during 2017 allowed us to again deploy cash in a variety of beneficial ways for our shareholders. And our net leverage ratio declined by a full turn and now stands at the midpoint of our targeted long-term range of 2 to 3 times. In addition to our team’s incredible efforts in responding to one of the most active storm seasons in recent history, we have several other notable accomplishments during the year that were important to executing on our powering ahead strategy. We once again grew the residential standby markets, new products and programs along with expanding our dealer base and retail shelf placement, all with a longer term goal in mind of increasing the awareness, availability and affordability of home stand by generators. We made further headway on gaining market share within domestic C&I products by focusing on our lead gas initiatives and expanding our natural gas product offering to take advantage of the accelerating shift from diesel to natural gas generators. We also successfully ramped production of our domestic mobile products in response to a dramatic market rebound with the further ramp expected during the first half of 2018. And lastly, we consolidated the country home products assembly and distribution operations in Winooski, Vermont into our Jefferson, Wisconsin facility. Allowing CHP to further focus on its core D2C marketing and sales capabilities at it’s headquarters in Vermont while providing better leverage of our existing manufacturing footprint. We made important progress during 2017 with the businesses that make up our international segment as our global expansion continued during the year with a record percentage of our sales coming from outside of the North American markets. We made encouraging progress in achieving strong synergies with the integration of Pramac, our largest acquisition to-date which closed in early 2016. Pramac had an excellent 2017 with very strong sales growth and margin expansion as they made important headway on strategic integration activities, including combining commercial activities with Tower Light and the consolidation of the Generac and Pramac locations in both the United Kingdom and Brazil. In addition, they achieved an important milestone of establishing and ramping up activities related to our newest sales branch in Australia with the goal of developing a home standby and introducing natural gas generators into the region. In our nearly two years of ownership, Pramac has performed beyond our expectations and continues to demonstrate the quality of the team and the business that we acquired. We are looking forward to further growing this business both in terms of sales as well as margins. Another important component of our lead gas strategic initiatives was our acquisition of the German company, Motortech, early in 2017. We believe the significant technical and market knowledge around gaseous engine controls possesed by this company will play an important role in our future success with gas power generation. In Latin America, Ottomotores had a very solid year with attractive sales growth alongside improving margins. In particular, we see this region as an important area of future growth for Generac and in support of further expanding our addressable market in Latin America, this morning we issued a separate press release announcing the signing of a purchase agreement to acquire Selmec. Founded in 1941 and headquartered in Mexico City, Selmec is a designer and manufacturer of diesel and gaseous field industrial generators ranging from 10 kilowatts to 2.75 megawatts. The company, which employs approximately 300 people and has over 100,000 square feet of production capacity, offers a market leading service platform and specialized engineering capabilities together with well developed integration, project management and remote monitoring services that provide for higher margins. Selmec’s deep expertise in standby energy solutions, specifically for telecom, data center, another mission critical applications, makes for a great with Generac Latin American strategy. Acquiring Selmec will also allow us to dynamically scale our existing Ottomotores business in Mexico, leveraging both the distribution and operational footprint for the combined businesses to offer the Latin American market a broader portfolio of product and solutions. As the transaction is expected to close sometime in the next three to six months pending regulatory approval, we have not yet included the impact of the acquisition within our 2018 guidance. And now I’d like to turn the call over York to provide further details on the fourth quarter results. York.
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.9% to $488 million as compared to $417.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, including $9.6 million of contributions from the Motortech acquisition, which closed on January 1, 2017. This resulted in very attractive core growth rate of approximately 13%. Looking at our consolidated net sales by product class, residential product sales during the fourth quarter increased 11.2% to $265.5 million as compared to $238.9 million in the prior year quarter with all this growth being organic. As Aaron mentioned, the quarter saw near record shipments of home standby generators driven by the high power outage environment experienced in the second half of 2017. Shipments of portable generators were better than expected and down only slightly versus prior year despite a tough comparison with Hurricane Matthew, which occurred in October of 2016. During the current year fourth quarter, we continue to see strong portable replenishment demand from our retail partners on the back of the active hurricane season and higher base line activity. In addition, we also saw broad base growth of portable generators internationally at Pramac due to market share gains, new product introductions and overall market growth. Looking at our commercial industrial products, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 27.1% to $188.3 million as compared to $148.1 million in the prior-year quarter with core organic growth being approximately 17%. Excluding the Motortech acquisition and favorable foreign currency impacts from a stronger euro versus dollar, the robust core organic increase was primarily due to the very strong growth in domestic mobile products, driven by the continuation of a fleet replacement cycle with our rental customers. In addition, our international segment benefited from larger project activity across the number of Pramac’s global sales branches. Net sales for the other products category, primarily made up of service parts, increased 12.3% to $34.2 million as compared to $30.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The strong growth was primarily due to increased demand for replacement parts as a result of the elevated level of power outage activity experience in the second half of 2017. Gross profit margin was largely flat at 36.8% compared to 36.9% in the prior year fourth quarter. A more favorable pricing environment and improved level of fixed manufacturing cost on the higher organic sales volumes compared to prior year were offset by unfavorable sales mix and higher commodities relative to prior year levels. Operating expenses increased $8.7 million or 11.4% as compared to the prior year but declined 60 basis points as a percentage of sales when excluding intangible amortization. The increase in operating expense dollars over the prior year was primarily driven by the addition of Motortech, increased variable cost on the stronger sales volumes and an increase in emplotment cost including higher incentive compensation recorded during the current year quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower promotional cost benefiting from the higher power outage activity. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company as defined in our earnings release was $108.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to $91 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin before deducting for non-controlling interest was 22.8% in the quarter as compared to 22 % in the prior year. The 80 basis point increase compared to prior year was mostly due to the previously mentioned improved leverage of fixed operating expenses on the stronger organic increase in sales. For the full year 2017, adjusted EBITDA came in at $311.7 million, resulting in 11% margin before deducting for non-controlling interest and 13.5% increase over prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 11.2% to $377.9 million as compared to $339.7 million in the prior-year quarter, the current year fourth quarter experienced strong growth in shipments of home stand by generators driven by increased outage activity along with the continuation of significant growth for mobile products. Also contributing to the year-over-year sales growth for increases in service part shipments. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $100.6 million or 26.6% of net sales as compared to $87.9 million in the prior year or 25.9% of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the current year benefited from afavorable pricing environment, including lower discounting and promotional cost and improved overall operating leverage on the higher organic sales volumes. These impacts were partially offset by higher commodity levels and an increase in employment cost, including higher incentive compensation recorded during the current year quarter. International segment sales increased 41.8% to $110.2 million as compared to $77.7 million in the prior year quarter, including $9.6 million of contribution from the Motortech acquisition. Core organic growth when backing out Motortech and the favorable impact from foreign currency was approximately 20%. This significant core organic growth was driven by increased shipments of both C&I and residential products, primarily within Pramac, which includes the benefit of large project activity across certain of their global sales grade offices. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interest improved to $10.5 million or 9.6% of net sales as compared to $3.9 million or 5% of net sales in the prior year. The earnings part of our international segment was on display during the quarter as we were able to generate attractive incremental margins for improved operating leverage on the significant organic sales growth. In addition, the improvement in margin was also due to favorable sales mix from the benefit of higher margin larger project activity. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher commodity prices seen in recent quarters and increased operating expenses associated with the expansion of certain branch operations in particularly in Australia. Now, switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter 2017 on a consolidated basis. GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $81.2 million as compared to $41.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The current year net income includes the impact of $28.4 million non-cash gain largely from the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the tax reform act. As a result, GAAP income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2017 rolling to $607,000. Wen excluding the aforementioned $28.4 million gains from the tax reform act, GAAP income taxes would have been $29 million or an effective tax rate 34.9% on an adjusted basis. This compares to $24.4 million or 37% effective tax rate for the prior year. Adjusted net income for the company as the defined in our earnings release was $85.9 million in the current year quarter versus $71.4 million in the prior year. The significant sales growth and improved operating margins drove this increase and were partially offset by higher cash income taxes during the quarter. With regards to cash income taxes, the fourth quarter of 2017 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $6 million as compared to $3.7 million in the prior year quarter. The current year cash taxes reflect the cash income tax rate of 12.5% for the full year 2017, while the prior year fourth quarter was based on a cash tax rate of 5.9% for the full year 2016. The current year cash taxes benefited from certain incremental tax deductions that were accelerated in response to the tax reform act. In addition, the fourth quarter cash taxes also benefited from higher than expected share based compensation deductions. The combination of these incremental tax deductions resulted in cash tax savings of approximately $10 million in the current year fourth quarter. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $1.30 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.64 in the prior year, with the current year earnings impacted by the aforementioned $28.4 million non-cash gain related to the tax reform act or $0.45 per share. Adjusted diluted net income per share for the company, as reconciled in our earnings, release was $1.37 per share for the current year quarter compared to $1.12 in the prior year. As just mentioned, the current year benefited from $0.15 of incremental accelerated tax deductions which lowered cash income tax expense for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was a quarterly record of $138.4 million as compared to $122.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter. Free cash flow, as defined in our earnings release, was also a quarterly record of $121.8 million as compared to $114.3 million in the same quarter last year. The year-over-year improvements in cash flow were driven by a variety of factors, including the increase in operating earnings and a larger benefit from working capital reduction during the current year, partially offset by higher cash income taxes and capital expenditures. The fourth quarter is typically the strongest cash flow quarter of the year from a seasonality standpoint. Free cash flow for the full year 2017 was $228 million as compared to $223 million for 2016. This resulted in 105% conversion of adjusted net income into free cash flow and once again demonstrates the strong cash flow capabilities of the company. During the fourth quarter, we amended our term loan credit facility, which among other items, favorably modified the pricing by reducing the applicable margin rate to a fixed rate of 2%, resulting in 25 basis points reduction in overall interest rate from the level previously in effect or approximately $2.3 million of annualize interest savings. In addition, certain terms were amended to eliminate the annual access cash flow payment requirement if our consolidated net leverage ratios maintain below 3.75 times. Also during the quarter, we made a total of approximately $110 million of debt repayments, including $100 million payment on our ABL revolving credit facility, paying off the entire outstanding balance as of December 31, 2017 with cash on hand. As of December 31, 2107, we had a total of $928.7 million of outstanding debt net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing cost and $138.5 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $790.3 million. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.5 times on an as reported basis, a healthy decline from 3.6 time at the end of 2016. Given our strong earnings and cash flow generation, we've demonstrated the rapid leveraging capabilities of the company. Additionally, at the end of the year, there was approximately $250 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. Thi availability on our ABL and the elimination of the term loan annual excess cash flow suite gives us tremendous flexibility when evaluating our prior uses of cash. Uses of cash during 2017 included $33 million for capital expenditures, $127 million for the repayment of debt and approximately $30 million for stock repurchases. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our outlook for 2018.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Today, we are initiating guidance for full year 2018 as we expect net sales to increase between 3% to 5% when compared to the prior year, which includes the favorable currency impact of between 1% to 2%. This guidance excludes major outage events for the year. When excluding the benefit of elevated portable generated shipments during 2017 related to the active hurricane season, net sales in 2018 are expected to increase between 7% and 9% as compared to the prior year, which we believe to be a relevant comparison when evaluating year-over-year growth rates. In addition, our top line outlook assumes no material changes in the current macro economic environment and also assumes a base line power outage severity level similar to the longer term average, which excludes major events. As a reminder, should the power outage environment in 2018 be higher or if there is a major outage event during the year, it is likely we could exceed these expectations. For historical perspective, an average major outage event could result in $50 million or more of additional sales depending on a number of variables. Lastly, as previously mentioned, this guidance does not include any impact from the Selmec acquisition announced today. As a timing of closing is undetermined pending required regulatory approvals. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year before adjusting for non-controlling interest are expected to be between 19% to 19.5% as compared to 19% for 2017, which includes favorable impact from pricing and anticipated cost savings from our company wide profitability enhancement program or PEP initiatives. Consistent with historical seasonality, we expect sales and EBITDA margins in the second half for the year to be higher relative to the first half with the first quarter representing the low point as net sales for the quarter as a percentage of full year 2018 sales are expected to be approximate the long-term first quarter average. With some access residential backlog entering the first quarter of 2018 and no major outage events assumed in our outlook, the improvement in second half sales and margins are not expected to be as pronounced when compared to the first half as has been the case in recent years. Lastly, I want to briefly comment on the tax reform act. We believe the recent passages of this legislation could have a favorable impact on future demand within many of the end markets we serve. The stimulus provided by lower cash tax obligations could further improve business sentiment and may lead to incremental investments in equipment, facilities and infrastructure in the U.S.. In addition to the potential benefit to our topline, which we are still evaluating, we expect corporate tax reform will also have a favorable impact to our net earnings and cash flows. I’ll now turn the call back over to York to talk more about the estimated impact of tax reform and also walk through some other guidance details to help model out the company’s cash flows and earnings per share for 2018. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. While we continue to assess the full impact of the tax reform act, our preliminary announces suggests a meaningful benefit from the legislation. Specifically for 2018, our GAAP effective tax rate is expected to decline between 25% to 26% as compared to the 35% adjusted full year rate for 2017 when excluding the $28.4 million non-cash gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Based on our guidance provided for 2018, our cash income tax expense for the year is expected to be approximately $28 million to $30 million, which translates into an anticipated full year 2018 cash income tax rate of between 12% to 13%. Before considering the impacts of the tax reform act, the anticipated cash tax rate for 2018 would have been approximately 17%. The reduction in the cash tax rate for 2018 as a result of tax reform is expected to result in a benefit to free cash flow of between $10 million to $12 million based on the outlook being provided. As a reminder, we still have a favorable tax shield as a result of the significant intangible amortization reduction in our corporate tax returns that results in our cash income tax rate being lower than our GAAP income tax rate. With the passage of the tax reform act, the tax affected annual value of this tax shield is now expected to be approximately $30 million per year due to decline in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. Lastly, I’ll provide some brief comments to help model cash flows and earnings per share for 2018. In 2018, we expect interest expense to be approximately $43 million, assuming the pricing in our newly amended term loan credit facility, our interest rate swap agreements that we currently have in place and a rising interest rate environment in 2018. Depreciation expenses forecast to be approximately $26 million, GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2018 is expected to be approximately $21 million, which is a reduction from $28.9 million in 2017. The year-over-year decline in expense is primarily a result of certain definite lives intangibles becoming fully amortized during 2017. Stock compensation expense is expected to increase to to approximately $12 million to $12.5 million. Our capital expenditures for 2018 are forecasted to be between 2% and 2.5% of our forecasted net sales for the year. For full year 2018, operating and free cash flow generation is once again expected to be strong and follow historical seasonality, benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow expected to be over 90% in 2018. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, I'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] filling in for Jeff. So if you could just size up the storm contribution impact in 2017? It looks like the guidance implies, call it $65 million, in incremental portable demand. But could you break out the residential standby piece of that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think we've always said the residential product class that we have the vast majority of our sales are home standby generators. I think what we did quantify because as you know portables when you have a major event that’s much more reactionary product category that volume spikes and then comes back down to previous levels, which is why we thought it relevant to at least try to quantify what the strong impact on portable was. On standby its much different. It elevates and then hold the new in our base line. So we don’t think it make sense the back that out. But from a portable stand point, we quantify what we believe to be the 2017 impact from major events as roughly that $65 million to 70 million.
Unidentified Analyst: Just trying to get a better feel for where in the post storm cycle we are. Could you provide any color on demand trends and backlog? Heading into 2018 just point towards where we are in that cycle compared to what we saw with Sandy a few years ago.
Aaron Jagdfeld: So we did have some backlog coming into the year from Q4’s order rates. And again, we called this out in our third quarter call. It’s not nearly to the level that we experienced with Sandy for a number of reasons. The biggest of which of course just the fact that these storms happened a lot earlier than the season than Sandy. So a lot of the benefit of that event is really captured in Q4. So with Sandy, it was a late event and it took us a little bit longer to ramp. We didn’t have quiet expertise we have today and our ability to ramp up. And as a result, a lot of that benefit float into the first and second quarter really of 2013. So a different situation, really primarily related to timing. There is a couple of other reasons too. I mean, obviously, these events weren’t the size of Sandy either, which I think is another important factor in that. But in terms of where we're at today in the cycle, we still see some very good demand. Usually what we say is, you’ll see two to four quarters of elevated demand following an event like this and really pronounced that the one year anniversary of that event. So we would expect the same thing to happen. What we see as we saw in Q4, continuing to see activations pacing ahead of prior year here as we go into Q1. We’re continuing to work down that backlog. Our order rates -- our lead times for orders have come in nicely from where they were in Q4, but strong demand there. And then our C&I business as we called out in particular our mobile business, we continue to see that market rebound sharply here as we thought beginning of last year it’s continued again here beginning of 2018.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Ross Gilardi: I just want to ask you on the guide for 2018. I mean looks like you’re implying to be about $35 million of EBITDA at the midpoint versus $31.2 million in 2017, so an increase of $23 million, $24 million. I mean you’ve got a very easy comp in the first quarter presumably that I would think gets somewhere close to that that up positive $25 million, I am not asking for guidance on Q1. But it feels like you’re assuming basically very, very limited year-on-year growth after the first quarter. And I would think your Q2 comp is also relatively speaking compared to last two years also on the easier side given the strength you’ve been seeing in both resi and semi -- resi and C&I. So am I thinking about that correctly, is that fair?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, I think that’s probably a fair assessment, Ross. I mean I think the big challenger of course is the second half of the year which because we don’t include any major events in our guide, it’s going to be a challenge at least on guidance -- as we issue guidance this morning, it’s difficult to comp that back half of the year. So that’s really I think where you probably are -- when you’re looking at it right I think in terms of first half, second half. But York, I don’t know…
York Ragen: I mean if you look, we’ve talked about that $65 million to $70 million portable impact from the storms, a lot of that happened in Q3. Based on the fact that we’re not assuming any major outages in 2018, that won’t repeat and that’s why we called that out. And then Q4 with our ability to ramp up here, we’re at near record levels on home standby in Q4. And again, without major events, you won’t be at that level but you will be at a new and higher base line, which I think is the key for home standby showing growth year-over-year there for the full year at least.
Ross Gilardi: And then could you just talk about the Florida market -- have you seen things calm down since the summer, and field inventory levels and the storm impacted areas what are those looking like?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So Florida specifically, Ross, obviously, it’s not as a fever pitch it was during the events and near-term right after. But it remains very robust. We saw great activations in Q4 in Florida and Texas and Puerto Rico for that matter, other impacted regions. But Florida specifically, what’s interesting about Florida and this is maybe another comparison to if you want to look back to Sandy, we don’t have the concentration of dealers in that market that we had in Northeast, so that’s another headwind to really trying to do that comp directly apples-to-apples with Sandy. So right now, we’re focused on expanding distribution. It has been almost 11 years since there was a major event down there. So you get a normal amount of attrition. Contractor just frankly turnover and that’s our dealer base. So it’s an effort to increase distribution, which we’ve done in Q4 and we’re continuing to do here in Q1. IHC the home consultations remain very strong down in Florida and activations as well. I mean it is a market where you can install products here around. I think that’s one difference from when you get events in some other regions of the country. But by enlarge in relation to field inventories, field inventories feel very -- especially in the storm affected areas, tight. So I think it’s a different pricing environment right now. And so you won't see the normal promotional cadence you may have seen from us over the last several years. We’ll run our national promotions and thing like that. But some of the one off promotions that we’ve run in the past are going to be more limited, just as a result of the formal pricing environment. And so that clearly I think put a lead on where field inventories go. So we feel very good coming into this year, especially when you look where we were versus a year ago regarding field inventories.
Ross Gilardi: So just one quick follow up to that point, so just getting your thoughts on price cost and what you’re baking in to the 2018 margin outlook; obviously, here in steel and copper up quite a bit. And didn’t get any sense from your comments here, you're overly concerned about that. Have you done anything to remove any of the metal content or anything like that from at a limited metal content from your generators.
York Ragen: I mean the metal content and generator to generator from that perspective. But I think from a price cut, the way we think about price cost is price on the price side, it will be -- I think Aaron just alluded to should be a relative prior year of more favorable pricing environment. So you’ll definitely see some positive impacts on the price side. On the cross side, we are seeing headwinds with commodities and currencies. But as -- we've talked about publically when we had our investor day and internally here we focus very hard on what we’re calling our profitability enhancement program and there is a lot of initiatives here that we're working on to help offset what may be headwinds relative to commodities and currencies. So from a overall net price cross standpoint, we think that should be a net favorable. And then given where we're seeing growth from '17 to '18, there is probably relative to mobile and international what not, probably a little bit of mix headwind but net-net, we do expect to grow margins up to 2017, EBITDA margins.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Drab of William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian Drab: On Selmec Mike, is there anything that you could tell us regarding purchase price roughly or revenue margins to help us model that one.
Aaron Jagdfeld: No, we’re not disclosing the details, other than what we’ve said these are bolt-on type acquisitions Brian. We've done a bunch of these in the past. And so it’s similar in size to many of those acquisitions, about 300 employees. But we’re not giving the specifics on the transaction at this point.
Brian Drab: And then just clarifying the guidance and better understand what you’re modeling in terms of weather activity. It includes the assumption longer term level of weather activity. Where we’ve been relative to that longer term average over the last say 12 months, just want to gauge whether the guide incorporates the step up step down or flat assumption through you got to that base level?
York Ragen: Actually, if you look at the last few quarters, up just strip up even the major landed hurricanes. Base line outage activity actually has been elevated, actually above the longer-term average the last few quarters or months. So this guide actually assumes a version down back to the longer-term average of baseline outages excluding majors. So not necessarily trying to run rate the higher levels that we saw here in 2017.
Brian Drab: And then just two more C&I in Europe, it sounds like you’re gaining traction there. Is there any more specifics you could provide regarding some of those new products that we saw that were in the works, we saw at the Analyst Day and how much traction they are gaining?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Brian, you hit the nail on the head, I mean that our European operations have done well. Obviously, the European economy is expanding, but we’re gaining traction with many of those new products. In particular, when you look on the mobile product side, the Lighting Towers that are more focused on LED lighting, fuel savings being the primary driver of that purchase in Europe with fuel cost being higher than you would find here in the U.S., driving the product line more that direction, hybridization of some of the products as well, again fuel savings being a key driver. But I think in general the other things that we’re very pleased with there is Pramac in particular has been focusing on some larger projects. We saw some projects in Russia and some other parts of the globe in China that we’re larger in scale from what they’ve historically done. So we believe that there is some great upside there of their ability to participate in those projects as a result of being part of a stronger company in terms of just the financial position of the company versus being a smaller independent company as they were before. So there is trust factor with the client base, the customers that are buying those extra types of products, and want to make sure that they’re back stopped by a strong company. And in particular our company with global operations many other companies we’re selling to have operations around the world and they want to have a consistent supplier around the world. So we’re starting to see that take hold as part of our thesis in building this out to become a Tier 1 C&I player. And we’re really seeing that grow. And I think what we’re going do in Latin America and what we’ve done already with Ottomotores and now with Selmec, you’re going to see us continue on this path.
Brian Drab: And then the last one, just trying to gauge how much visibility you feel you have to the follow on impact of Irma and the recent hurricanes. I’m getting the sense that you’re communicating that the path has and demand that’s happened and you’ll see some -- we’re going to see some after effect continuing in home standby. But do you feel like you really have that pin down in terms of what the following demand is going to be as we move through 2018. Or is there a lot of variability around your estimate of that impact?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Well, again and maybe it’s a good opportunity to talk through this. It’s a step function type business. So we saw the pop last year to grow to a new level and now we’re holding that level. And in the absence -- as we do with guidance, this is the problem with guiding for this company, right. Because the episodic nature of our residential business when we guide without events, it’s maybe underwhelming when you hear it. But the reality of it is it provides a tremendous amount of upside potential with the company should those events happen. We’ve gotten use to not providing our guidance inclusive of the events, because we think it’s the more conservative position to take. I don’t know if that hurts the stock in the short run or helps us is long run. I don’t know that at all. But the fact of the matter is that we think that we continue to see as my comments said, we continue to see really good activity down in those markets that were impacted by the storm, that’s what helps us whole value in higher base line. We're looking at expanding distribution in those markets and we think that that normal two to four quarter pacing with home standby is going to continue this time around as we’ve seen in the past.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Stanley Elliott: Couple of quick questions. Do you guys have any delays in terms of the install on the whole standby because of weather either in Q4 or even in the January?
Aaron Jagdfeld: No, not really, Stanley. Again, I think this time around because we're in much of the storm activity was in normal weather climate, really provided an opportunity to install products on a pre consistent basis, so already installed and are notoriously long, because the permitting process can be longer. Generally there is an LP tank involved if you don’t have an natural gas line available, so there is a little bit more in terms of logistics, which can stretch out install. But we're not seeing anything that would be dramatic, not like if you had in event in the northeast or mid west where you’d have the frozen ground. We see seasonality with installs there, normal seasonality there.
Stanley Elliott: And as far as the margin improvement that you guys had on the international business, which was great. Is there a way to parse out what you’ve done structurally in terms of the cost out there or versus how much of that is mix from some of the larger projects you guys ship?
Aaron Jagdfeld: It’s more the mix and the leverage than anything, Stanley, that’s really how I would characterize that. We've done some cost out as well, so that -- especially when you look at in Latin America in particular.
Stanley Elliott: And then lastly from me with getting rid of the cash sweep and the improved free cash flow. Does it change your appetite in terms of M&A from bolt-on the deals to larger size deals, especially with your leverage be in right in the middle of your targeted range?
Aaron Jagdfeld: We’ve talked about this in the past. Our acquisition strategy today has been anything that helps us advance our powering ahead strategy faster. So I think bolt-ons has been a great way for us to do that. It’s not that we don’t look at larger deals, it’s just -- and I think even with our financial position a year ago, we would have able to do a larger deal if we wanted to, just being in better financial position today, give us an even better position to do that, it could. I mean, I won’t say that our funnel doesn’t include larger things, it does but I would say our primary focus is on bolt-ons.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chip Moore with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
Chip Moore: I guess with dealers at 5,700 and growing this year. Most of those new dealer additions on power play and may be you can talk about close rates for those guys whether you’re churning out some not using the sales tools.
Aaron Jagdfeld: What I can say about that, Chip, is that we endeavored to put all dealers on power play. We have a lot of them on power play. In fact, if you want to strip apart the distribution, the better dealers are on power play and you see that not only in their size but also their close rates, so dealer that use power play have higher close rates. Again, we don’t get into quoting specifics on what they are, but they are materially higher than you would see in dealers that don’t use the tool. And again, for us the biggest thing that it gives us is great visibility for those deals that don’t close. And that’s been I think an area of intense focus here on how we work that file as we refer to it internally, call it a file. And that file of unclosed IHCs and proposals that that is there is a really rich marketing opportunity for us. And as that file grows and as outages happen, we track outages as we said before as we look to do promotions whether they be nationally or regionally, we can tap that file in ways that just wasn’t available to us five years ago prior to having it. So it’s a really important tool for us. It also give us great visibility on how install costs are trending, how they trend from one dealer to the next, one region to the next. It’s just an incredible amount of data for us, and it’s been something that’s been huge part of how we’ve focused on growing that market in spite of not having any major events. And I think it really paid out for us as we said during the third quarter call, we saw IHC rates that were we’ve never seen before, because we haven’t pressure tested the tool. So it’s been great to watch to that, the upside of that is on the data that we get.
Chip Moore: And maybe follow on rolling out remote monitoring capabilities initial reception how that’s trending?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So the product line is going to launch here in April-May timeframe with standard remote connectivity. We think that this is a again another major initiative, major differentiator between ourselves and competitors, but probably even more than that, because I think what’s really important is this connectivity layer that we’re putting in and we’re developing in all in-house we’re working on it for last couple of years and it will be across the product line, there will be different levels of service. Of course, there is a pay level of service to the premium level service. But I think what’s really important is longer term when you think about that, it’s not only that we can give the home owner and the dealer better information about their product, and it’s all about the uptime of our emergency product, but we see on market in the future that could develop where these assets, these generators, as opposed to being singularly used as an emergency back up only could be deployed in a different fashion. They could be deployed in as part of our businesses, energy strategy or homeowners’ energy strategy to help reduce their energy cost. And connectivity layer makes that all possible. And so we think that this is -- we haven’t talked a lot of about this is part of our lead gas initiatives and strategy. And you’re going to hear more about that going forward. But the term distributed generation demand response, these are terms that in particular have always centered on the commercial and industrial part of the market and come in, in and out of favor based on where gas prices are and utility prices are. But we see this as a major market opportunity for us in the future across our entire business line. And we think residential is going to play a role on that. It’s going to be pretty cool of what’s just developed over the next few years, but that connectivity layer is central to it.
Chip Moore: And maybe if could just…
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Charlie Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.
Charlie Brady: Just on the mobile product side, that’s an area that’s been pretty strong for almost a year as we go through Q1 of last year towards relate to your tail end. Do you have a sense -- and it sounds like it’s still going pretty strong in the 2018 here. Do you have a sense as to how length of time until, I don’t want to say the restock saturation, but you’ve soaked up this demand because of a lack buying during the energy patch downturn when they’re rotating products outside of energy and other areas, just to trying to get an idea of the length of how long we might see this rapid growth in mobile it sounds pretty good.
Aaron Jagdfeld: The information we get from our customers and we’re talking all and the major and independent rental companies out there. There is a couple of factors. First of all, actually the oil and gas piece of that is only in nearly innings with oil prices only really recently getting into a range where oil and gas exploration and production have begun to ramp. The products that serve those markets, the lighting towers the gen, the heaters, pumps and things that we manufacture, are really starting to only now improve in terms of our order rates. I think up until this point, it’s really been about general rates weighting, the fleets went through an extra year or two of the rental company holding on to those assets before the secondary markets were depressed. So in terms of getting the returns that they are looking for and utilization rates were depressed, they held on to the equipment as opposed to turning it. And so that refresh cycle has been ongoing. And actually that’s still -- we’re probably more middle innings on that. When we talk to our customer base there, it feels like the majority of 2018 could be a pretty solid year that we're planning for to such in terms of our production capacities and our supply chain readiness, we’re attacking that pretty vigorously. We think that there is going to be window here to raise for share that market and make sure that we not only maintain our share but maybe even grow our share opportunistically by taking some bigger bets on whether its inventory safety stock or some other could be finished good safety stock there as the rental companies deploy CapEx throughout the year. Just looking the public comments that many of the rental companies have made clearly CapEx spending is going to be up this year versus prior years. And then I think lot of those comments were made really prior to the tax reform act, which could have an added bonus there in both literally and vigorously in bonus depreciation. So the ability to accelerate depreciation on purchases of capital equipment here over the next several years could lead to may be an exacerbated fleet refresh cycle as a result of that. So we have to wait to see we're still evaluating that, but that’s how we view it.
Charlie Brady: Just as a follow up, I just want to go back to your comment and I guess in prepared remarks you talked about the seasonality this year and you talked about first quarter representing the low point for net sales for the quarter and you got percentage of total year. I'm just trying to square that up, because you’ve got obviously a second half pretty tough comp you mentioned in resi, and you still got some flow through at least a little bit of backlog coming out of Q4 from the hurricanes. Is it a function of the mix between the resi and the C&I that drives that, so you’ve got some offsetting there I am just trying to…
York Ragen: I think the way we’ve laid it out, Charlie, I mean that just -- given the seasonality of the residential business even with some backlog coming into '18, that Q1 is always the low point of the year. And I think and looking at how we're laying things out, we think it’s going to be more indicative of the longer term average. So if you look at first quarter as a percentage of the total year. The last couple of years, it’s just been low relative to longer term average we think Q1 would be benefit us from that excess resi backlog coming here it will be more normalized. And then it will be build from there it’s just the way the resi side of the business works. And then on the C&I side, I guess, we just expect some building throughout the year as well.
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think the important thing there is without the assumption of any major events, resi is more level loaded for the year. And Q1 still be more so than normal, much more so than normal. And again I think we said in the prepared remarks. But it’s really the assumption of not having outages the major outages in the guidance.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn: On the overall pricing and cost inflation curve, just wondering if you’re in a steady stated balance there or if there is some call it on the gross margin impact in the first half versus the second half. Just the mix of lead times to price realization for a lot companies is all over the map. So just trying to figure out where you guys sit there?
York Ragen: We look at both commodities and currencies and look at our lags and many. I think to your point it varies depending on the supplier. But on average, it may -- there maybe three to four months of passing on particular commodity movement or currency movement with the supply chain. And then it might be another two to three months to get through inventory. So I mean there could be some pretty long lags relative to when we see a commodity move or a currency move to when it shows up in our financial statements. And that really gives us time actually in terms of executing cost reductions as well. So I think we’ve seen with the weakening of the dollar, there are some things that we’re looking at there and we’re watching it closely. But the commodities have moderated a bit here but we’re watching it close and have forecasted them quarterly with the corporate lags.
Christopher Glynn: So it sounds like you’re pretty well balance currently with the good price inputs?
York Ragen: I mean that’s the key, as we believe that the pricing environmentally be more favorable to help offset that.
Christopher Glynn: And then in the outlook for 2% to 3% organic for the year, if I missed it, but could you give some qualitative comments on resi versus C&I in that?
York Ragen: I think as far as resi goes, I think we quantify that I guess call it the headwind from portables that if you don’t assume a major. So I think the portables year-over-year will be down but we believe home standby will see some nice growth. Obviously, heavier in the first half versus the second half from a growth perspective, but we think that home standby growth will help to offset that portable headwind. And on C&I, there is a number of pieces there but that mobile business Aaron just alluded we believe we’re going to see some very strong continued growth in the mobile side. And that international segment we’re going to continue to see some very nice growth there as well. So again expect some strong growth out of the C&I side.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich: I’m wondering if you could just expand on the comments around the operational plans to ramp up production for the mobile business. Can you just may be share lead times with us, where they stand today, how you assess the bottlenecks for particularly that part of that business. And on the flip side Aaron you spoke about ramping up faster on the standby gen-set side. And in this post storm period, can you talk about where lead times stand today compared to three months ago and what's your operational plan to scale that down from an employee standpoint et cetera.
Aaron Jagdfeld: So on the mobile product side it’s really about adding shifts, manpower to achieve some of those higher level. In terms of lead times on those products today, it depends on the product. But if you look at a typical lighting tower I mean the lead times are getting extended there, depending on the configuration. I mean in fact for us we’ve seen most of our production get booked up here in Q1, and we’re kind booking slots now into Q2. Now that can change if we can continue to ramp, we’re starting to see some potential constraints there even some of the supply chain, some of the major engine suppliers in those product ranges are beginning to also feel tightness and are pushing out lead times. So that’s actually impacting us more. Frankly, if we could get some of these engines, we could build more product here but starting to tighten up. Now, we have other engine partners and so we're bringing those online as well. But it’s been normal stuff you run through when you grow as quickly as that business is rebounded. On the standby side, my comments were about the residential stand, we're really able to grab a lot quicker in response to the active storm season this past fall in that business and may be the last comparable in 2012 with Sandy, for a couple of reasons; one, we had more safety stock components; two, we had gotten our supply chain into a position this time around, to be able to supply more product more quickly; and three, through continued investments in automation and other improvements in our efficiencies on the actual assembly of the products, we’re just able to get there quicker. And as far as the ramp down on the other side of that, there is a normal attrition rate that takes place in any manufacturing environment that we would see. I think we’ll be able to achieve. We do want to make sure we’ve got appropriate levels of inventory both in our stock as well as in the field going into next season. So that ramp down won’t be a cliff, it will be -- gradually decline down, you let attrition take over there, and then you get into a position where you’re ready for the next storm season. So we feel really good about where we're at in that cycle today. And I think the benefit of having pressure tested that whole ramp up ramp down I think only goes to benefit the company in the long run when we see these episodic events happen.
Jerry Revich: And Aaron on the lead times for the standby product, can you just give us an update or maybe comment on different way where you’re coming order rates versus production for this quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So what I can say about that, Jerry, is that our lead times for product really in the Q3 to Q4 range we're out, two to three weeks depending on the products on average. And today they’re much near inside of a week. So we’ve been able to -- as we’ve said we in our prepared remarks, there is a little bit of backlog coming into the beginning of the year and nice flow of backlog there, excess backlog as we would say that we work down here into January and February. And today we feel -- it’s a pretty good balance of what we’re seeing.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Aaron Jagdfeld, President and CEO for any further remarks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Okay, thanks. We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to reporting our first quarter 2018 earnings results, which we anticipate will be at some point in early May. With that, have a good day. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

We experienced record quarterly sales and robust organic sales growth of approximately 20%, with overall net sales increasing 23% compared to the prior year, including the contribution from the Motortech acquisition. This sales growth translated into an overall 21% increase in adjusted EBITDA along with a strong increase in operating and free cash flow compared to the prior year. With significant power outage severity resulting from three landed hurricanes, shipments of portable generators increased dramatically during the quarter, as our team worked diligently with our channel partners to quickly get these products to customers in the storm affected regions. End-user activations of home standby generators were also strong with broad-based growth across all regions with particular strength in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. Demand for domestic mobile products also continue to be much stronger as compared to the prior year levels, as our rental equipment customers further replaced and upgraded their fleets during the quarter. We also saw healthy end market growth within the international segment, as shipments increased 7% organically on a constant currency basis from strength in both C&I and residential products, primarily within the European and Latin American regions. The active hurricane season during the third quarter resulted in a surge in demand for portable generators, and significant improvements in several home standby demand metrics, including in-home consultations. Despite the billions of dollars spent by utilities over the past decade on their electrical grids within the impacted areas of the hurricanes, there were millions of utility customers without power that resulted in hundreds of millions of outage hours. Hurricane Harvey caused tremendous flood-related damage in Texas, but overall was a relatively minor power outage event. However, Hurricane Irma resulted in significant power outages across the entire state of Florida, and was the second largest outage event, since we began measuring this activity in 2010. While Hurricane Maria did not make landfall in the Mainland U.S., this storm did have a devastating impact on the island of Puerto Rico, including widespread destruction of the island's power grid. These events adversely impacted millions of people with cleanup and rebuilding efforts still continuing. As a company, whose core products are focused very heavily on backup power generation, our business model is built around providing a very high level of service and support during these types of outage events. I'm extremely proud of our teams at Generac, as they stepped up their efforts by shipping products around the clock to the affected regions, addressing the large increase in call volume from customers, providing technical support to our distribution partners, as well as supporting field-based products repairs from our many teams that travelled directly to the storm areas. The customer support tools, sales processes, and distribution that we've put in place since the last major event approximately five years ago, allowed our teams to execute at a very high level. Importantly, Hurricane Irma essentially represents the first real opportunity to test our targeted marketing processes in PowerPlay in-home selling solution in a major outage scenario. We are leveraging these systems and processes to manage a significant increase in in-home consultations or IHCs as we refer to them for home standby generators. The IHCs have been trending at levels never previously seen before, and our distribution partners are incredibly busy trying to address these leads. I would also like to briefly comment on the difficult situation in Puerto Rico, with nearly 70% of the island still without power, six weeks after Hurricane Maria's landfall. Much of our efforts to date to help the people in Puerto Rico with temporary power has been centered around the logistics of getting products, service parts, and personnel to the island. The unprecedented level of power outage is still being experienced, follows a significant outage event that occurred on the island in September of last year, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in demand for our products. Puerto Rico remains a relatively small, but growing portion of our business with shipments to this U.S. territory primarily classified in our domestic segment results. As the leader in residential backup power, we believe no other company in this industry offers the high level of support we've been providing to satisfy the needs of customers. Looking forward, we have ramped production for home standby generators to meet the current and anticipated increased demand for these products, and we're also early in the process of replenishing our portable generator inventories back to more normalized levels. An area of our business that continues to experience a cyclical recovery is our domestic mobile products offering, primarily serving in rental markets. After significant declines experienced during 2015 and 2016, demand for these products continues to rebound quickly, as we experienced significant year-over-year growth in shipments during the third quarter, with this momentum continuing so far into the fourth quarter. We still believe this fleet replacement cycle is primarily being driven by the overall age of current equipment with oil and gas-related capital spending still fairly muted in terms of impact. With oil prices averaging around the $50 level so far in 2017, we believe a meaningful recovery in the purchase of mobile equipment for use in this market has not yet gained traction. However, utilization rates for several of the product categories hit hardest during the oil and gas downturn are improving, which could potentially lead to some oil and gas-related opportunities in the near-term. We are optimistic toward returning to sustainable long-term growth going forward for mobile products given the current rental replacement upcycle, combined with the potential for a future recovery in the energy sector, and the macro opportunity with increased infrastructure spending. Shipments of stationary C&I products in North America through our distributors improved modestly as compared to the prior year with more recent project quotation levels trending higher. Demand trends from our national telecom customers continue to be soft during the third quarter, resulting from their ongoing reprioritization of capital, in part, due to the previously lower power outage environment. Historically, major outage events have been a catalyst for our domestic C&I products business by highlighting the awareness of the importance of having backup power for businesses, institutions and other critical infrastructure during large scale power outages. For example, the state of Florida recently announced new rules in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, requiring nursing homes and assisted living facilities to have sufficient backup power to sustain critical care operations and maintain comfortable temperatures for a minimum number of days following a utility outage. Also, there was a notable reduction in wireless communications in Florida, and particularly in Puerto Rico, as these networks lost power. As a result of these awareness events, we believe there will likely be an increase in demand for backup power by our telecom customers, as a further work to protect the uptime of their wireless networks going forward. In general, following a major outage event, demand for C&I products builds at a much slower rate relative to our residential products, and our visibility with respect to quotation and order levels for these products should become clear, as we get closer towards the end of the year and into early 2018. Rounding off the discussion of our domestic segment, the Country Home Products acquisition continues to perform very well, with shipments and margins further improving at a strong rate during the third quarter as compared to the prior year, as this business benefited from the extended summer growing season. We are also making good progress in consolidating CHP's Vermont based assembly and distribution operations into our Jefferson, Wisconsin facility, with the transition remaining on track to be completed by the end of the year. Now, let me provide some brief comments regarding the trends for our international segment, which have had solid core organic sales growth and margin expansion during the third quarter as compared to the prior year. Pramac continues to perform very well with strong sales growth during the third quarter, as well as year-over-year margin expansion. Pramac has been making good progress on important integration activities including the combination of Tower Light commercial activities within its business, the consolidation of the Generac and Pramac locations in both the UK and Brazil, and the startup and first shipments from their newest sales branch in Australia. Our Ottomotores business, which serves the Latin American market, once again experienced strong growth for both C&I and residential products during the quarter, and has leveraged this growth into improved margins on a year-over-year basis. This business also has a solid backlog entering the fourth quarter, and the project pipeline is encouraging as we look towards 2018. Lastly, our recent Motortech acquisition, which closed on January 1, has performed well during our limited time of ownership, with sales and margins exceeding our expectations on a year-to-date basis. We remain excited about the opportunity to leverage Motortech's deep technical capabilities related to gaseous-fuel and ignition systems, in order to better capitalize on this faster-growing segment of the generator market and to explore new market opportunities. And now, I'm going to turn the call over to York to discuss third quarter results in more detail. York?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks Aaron. Net sales for the quarter increased 22.5% to $457.3 million as compared to $373.1 million in the third quarter of 2016, including $10.1 million of contribution from the Motortech acquisition, which closed on January 1, 2017. Looking at our consolidated net sales by product class, residential product sales during the third quarter increased 30.6% to $251.9 million as compared to $192.9 million in the prior-year quarter, with all this growth being organic. As Aaron mentioned, portable generators made up the majority of this increase driven by the increased outage activity from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria during the quarter. As the leader in residential backup power, we hold a strategic investment in portable generator inventory coming into any given season. With the large spike in outage severity in the third quarter, we were able to monetize this working capital investment as we satisfied the needs of our customers in the impacted regions. To a lesser extent, the increase in residential product sales was also due to higher shipments of home standby generators and DR branded outdoor power equipment from Country Home Products. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales for the third quarter of 2017 increased 16.6% to $174.5 million as compared to $149.7 million in the prior-year quarter, with core organic growth being 8%. The core increase was primarily due to very strong growth in domestic mobile products, driven by the continuation of a fleet replacement cycle with our rental customers. The year-over-year core growth also benefited from increased organic shipments of C&I products within the European and Latin American regions. Net sales for the other products category, primarily made up of service parts sales, was up slightly to $30.8 million as compared to $30.6 million in the third quarter of 2016. Gross profit margin was 34.4% compared to 36.9% in the prior-year third quarter. This 250-basis point decline in gross margin as compared to the prior year was mainly the result of an unfavorable sales mix. The shift in mix was driven by the significant growth in shipments of portable generators and mobile products during the quarter, which carry lower gross margins relative to the consolidated corporate average. The higher commodity prices seen in prior quarters and recent strengthening of certain foreign currencies also negatively impacted margins. However, these impacts were largely offset by favorable overall pricing and improved leverage of fixed manufacturing costs on the higher organic sales. Operating expenses increased $3.2 million or 3.9%, as compared to the third quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with the Motortech acquisition and additional incentive compensation accrued during the current-year quarter. In addition, intangible amortization expense declined $2.3 million over the prior year with the prior year third quarter including a $1 million write-off related to a trade name, as a result of a new product transition. As a result of the organic net sales growth during the third quarter of 2017, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding intangible amortization declined 240 basis points as compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company as defined in our earnings release was $87.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $72.1 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin before deducting for non-controlling interest was 19.4% in the quarter as compared to 19.5% in the prior year. The approximately flat adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the prior year was due to the previously mentioned unfavorable gross margin impacts being largely offset by the improved overall leverage of fixed operating expenses on the organic increase in sales. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 21.8% to $364.3 million as compared to $299.1 million in the prior-year quarter, which were all organic sales. The increase was primarily due to the substantial growth in shipments of portable generators driven by the increased outage activity from the active hurricane season, along with the continuation of very strong growth for mobile products. Also contributing to the year-over-year sales growth were increases in home standby generators and specialty outdoor power equipment. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $83.1 million or 22.8% of net sales, as compared to $69.3 million in the prior year, or 23.2% of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the current year was impacted by unfavorable sales mix due to the significantly higher sales of portable generators and mobile products. This unfavorable mix impact was partially offset by improved overall leverage of fixed manufacturing and operating expenses on the organic increase in sales. Overall, positive pricing effects were offset by higher commodities and strengthening currencies versus the U.S. dollar. International segment sales increased 25.5% to $92.9 million as compared to $74 million in the prior-year quarter. When excluding the impact from the Motortech acquisition, sales for the segment increased 11.8%, and when excluding the impacts of foreign currency, increased approximately 7% on a constant currency basis. This core organic growth was due to increased shipments of both C&I and residential products within the European and Latin American regions. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interest was $5.6 million or 6.1% of net sales as compared to $3.5 million or 4.8% of net sales in the prior year. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin as compared to the prior year was primarily due to improved leverage of fixed manufacturing and operating expenses on the organic increase in sales, and to a lesser extent the addition of the Motortech acquisition. These impacts were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher commodity prices. Now, switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2017 on a consolidated basis, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $39.7 million as compared to $26.2 million in the third quarter of 2016. The prior year net income included a $3 million loss on change in contractual interest rate relating to our Term Loan Credit Agreement. GAAP income taxes during the third quarter of 2017 were $20.6 million or 33.9% tax rate as compared to $15.5 million or 37.4% tax rate for the prior year. The decline in the GAAP tax rate is primarily due to non-recurring discrete tax items that modestly increased our tax rate in the prior year and decreased our tax rate in the current year. Adjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release was $57.8 million in the current year quarter versus $53.2 million in the prior year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.64 in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $0.40 in the prior year with the prior year earnings impacted by the aforementioned $1 million intangible trade name write-off and $3 million loss on change in contractual interest rate. Adjusted diluted net income per share for the company as reconciled in our earnings release was $0.93 per share for the current year quarter compared to $0.82 in the prior year. Weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 62.3 million in the current year third quarter versus 65.1 million in the prior quarter, a 4.3% decline reflecting the impact of our share repurchase activity over the last year. With regards to cash income taxes, the third quarter of 2017 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $10.9 million as compared to $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. The current year cash taxes reflect an expected cash tax rate of approximately 17% for the full-year 2017, while the prior year third quarter was based on an expected cash tax rate of approximately 6% for the full-year 2016. As a reminder, our favorable tax shield of approximately $50 million through annual intangible amortization on our tax return, results in our cash income tax rate being significantly lower than our GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% for 2017. Cash flow from operations was $67 million as compared to $48.3 million in the prior year. Free cash flow, as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules was $60.4 million as compared to $41.4 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year increases in cash flow were primarily driven by higher operating earnings in the current year quarter, along with a stronger reduction in working capital investment during the current year quarters compared to the prior year. Free cash flow on a trailing four quarter basis was $220 million as compared to $210 million in the previous comparable trailing four quarter period, demonstrating the strong cash flow capabilities of the company. As of September 30, 2017, we had a total of $1.039 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs and $128.8 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $910.2 million. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 3.1 times on an as-reported basis, a decline from 3.9 times as compared to the same period last year, and 3.6 times at the end of 2016. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, there was approximately $142 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the third quarter. However, since the inception of the initial share repurchase program in August 2015, a total of 8.1 million shares have been repurchased for approximately $280 million. This resulted in an average cost basis of approximately $34.50 per share representing an attractive use of capital when considering the shares current trading levels. Lastly, we entered into an additional $250 million in interest rate swaps during the quarter, which brings our total notional principal balance hedged to $500 million fixed, beginning in July 2018 through May 2023 at a blended cost of approximately 2%. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our updated outlook for 2017.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, York. We were revising upward our prior guidance for revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margins for the full-year 2017, which is primarily due to an increased outlook for portable and home standby generators, as a result of the higher power outage activity experienced during the third quarter. The higher outlook for portable generator sales for the full year is due to the spike in demand from the significant hurricane activity during the third quarter, along with a certain amount of replenishment by our channel partners expected during the fourth quarter. Home standby shipments are expected to be at or near record levels during the fourth quarter, resulting from the anticipated higher demand following the recent outage events coupled with our ability to ramp up production of these products quickly. Full year net sales are now expected to increase between 14% to 15% over the prior year, which is an increase from the 6% to 8% growth previously expected. Total core organic sales growth is now anticipated to increase 9% to 10%, which is an improvement from the previous assumption of 2% to 3%, and is expected to be balanced between the residential and C&I product classes. Adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interest is now expected to be approximately 19% for the full year, an improvement from the prior guidance of approximately 18.5%. The improvement in margin guidance is primarily due to the improved leverage of fixed manufacturing and operating expenses on the higher expected sales volumes, partially offset by an unfavorable shift in sales mix, the impact from certain foreign currency exchange rate changes, and higher incentive compensation costs. Operating and free cash flow generation is forecasted to further improve sequentially during the fourth quarter, benefiting from the strong conversion of adjusted net income, which is expected to be over 90% for the full year. With our increased sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full-year 2017, we anticipate our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to be well below 3 times by the end of the year, which is within our long-term targeted range of 2 times to 3 times. In addition, we are providing an update on certain other guidance details to help model the company's earnings per share and cash flows for full-year 2017. As a result of the expected improved earnings outlook, cash taxes are now expected to be approximately $34 million to $35 million, which translates into an anticipated full-year 2017 cash income tax rate of approximately 17%. Capital expenditures are now forecasted to be below 2% of full-year 2017 net sales, as a result of the improved top line outlook for the year. This concludes our prepared remarks, and at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital. Sir, your line is now open.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff. How are you doing?
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hey. So, Aaron, I really wanted to just get a little more color, I mean, you've added all these selling tools which you talked about, and just as you've kind of experienced kind of early follow through from the storm, just talk about how do you think this plays out differently or where you think which tools or where you think you're going to do a lot better relative to perhaps Sandy in terms of close rates et cetera?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's obviously an area, Jeff, of intense debate internally here, because we didn't have these tools in place previously. They all kind of came on board around 2013 after Sandy. So, we've never had a chance to pressure testament, as a result, we don't – the data that we're seeing out of some of these tools is very different from the data that we've experienced over the last four years, since we put them in place. So, IHCs, in our prepared remarks we said they were – I think we said dramatically higher. I mean, they're like well above the rates we are seeing. And so the traditional kind of math that we were doing on conversion with close rate and what percentage of our home standby flowed that IHCs represented, and we have to kind of recalibrate all that. So, I think the one thing that I do know is that, first of all, we'll have better visibility. So, I think that without a doubt is, just given these tools, we see not only the kind of leading indicators like IHCs, we see the pipeline of business, because PowerPlay gives us at least for those sales leads that go through the PowerPlay tool, we get to see just how are the – how many proposals are being issued? What is the close rate on those proposals? How does that differ from what we've historically seen? We know that at least with the PowerPlay tool in place that close rates for dealers using PowerPlay are better than close rates for dealers that don't use PowerPlay. So, that in and of itself having the tool here in place today versus where we were at with Sandy should lead to better close rates for at least those leads that go through the tool. I think the other comment that I'll make aside from the sales tools and the targeted marketing, we also put a lot of time and effort after Sandy into our production capabilities, our ability to expand capacity, and – both at the supply chain level, as well as in the factories here in Wisconsin. And so what we're seeing, it's interesting, the dynamic of this event, and we'll just focus on Irma for a second, even though there were three events. Irma occurred from a calendar standpoint, purely from a calendar standpoint, six weeks earlier than Sandy did. Sandy was at the end of October, Irma was really mid-September. So that six-week window coupled with our ability to ramp quicker, because we're just – we are more – we're sized more appropriately for this size of event. We believe, it's going to be reflected in the fourth quarter. We said that the home standby shipments are going to be at or near record levels in the fourth quarter, and we've had some big quarters. If you remember, the first quarter of 2013, we came into the year with a tremendous amount of backlog coming out of 2012 of a Sandy. And so 2013 first quarter was a huge quarter for us for standby. We think that the fourth quarter of this year is going to rival that quarter, and potentially exceed it. So, I think, better visibility, the ability to better ramp, and I think, better conversion on those sales, although I can't quite quote a statistic yet, because we just – we'll have to see how it plays out.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Very helpful. And then, you mentioned Puerto Rico, which sounds terrible and devastating and long outages, but we thought it would be relatively small opportunity. So, can you just kind of size that opportunity, is it more industrial, is it more portable? And then also on the Florida nursing home opportunities, (27:18) the market opportunity there? Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Right. Yeah, I think – let me tackle Florida first, because it's a little bit more of a – it's probably an easier answer there. In terms of the number of facilities, there's a little bit of more of a known kind of set of opportunity there. It's been estimated that that could be upwards of $240 million opportunity, just market wise. And so just very recently the governor's emergency order there was effectively stayed in terms of the timeline. There's legislation being crafted in Florida that will tackle this for certain going forward and it needs to be tackled, because it's a very important element of the strategy around critical care facilities that the temperature control be also included in the backup strategy. And that really wasn't a requirement previously, and we're going to start to see that, I think, beyond Florida as well. I think it will potentially spread into other areas where temperature control is not necessarily been dictated to be part of critical care facilities emergency backup. So, that's the Florida opportunity, that should really come to bear fruit, and we're already engaging with a couple of large partners there, and we've got some very nice – one very nice project that we already are working on directly for Florida that will probably – it's not going to ship this year, but it should ship in 2018. And we think there's going to be a lot more of that, there's a lot of smaller critical care facilities in Florida that are also going to have to comply with this order or law – rule of law whatever ends up taking. With Puerto Rico, just a step back from Puerto Rico, I mean, obviously the devastation there is unlike anything we've ever experienced before. We deliver a lot of products into areas of the country and areas of the world for that matter where you come in after a disaster. But, I mean, Puerto Rico, the isolated nature of it as an island has really hampered the – not only the recovery effort with 70% of the island still in the dark, but it's really hampered the logistics around being able to get products and people and support where it's needed. And so, it's just a huge effort there that I think there's a lot of really good work being done now, but it's hard, I mean it's an island, you've got about 3.5 million, 3.4 million inhabitants there. It's about like the size of Iowa. So, in terms of the opportunity for us, you're right. We probably wouldn't have ascribed a ton of opportunity, and traditionally it's been a decent market, but it's really – it's small, it's like the entire Caribbean is not a huge market for us, but there's a need for backup power. The gas infrastructure on the islands is not great either, so it doesn't really fit well with a lot of our kind of gas solutions. But – so what we're seeing is more to your point, we're actually seeing a lot of portable generators, because you can get gasoline in portable generators or diesel fuel. And then we're also seeing large diesel generators, the requests for large diesel generators is incredible right now and people want anything they can get. There is a lot of factories, a lot of pharmaceutical manufacturing, and other factories that have moved into Puerto Rico over the years, and for whatever reason didn't have adequate backup strategies. A little bit amazing to me, an island that, I mean, you can see a map in terms of storm activity, I mean, the island gets crisscrossed by a lot of storm activity over the last several decades. So, it's clearly a risk for anybody doing anything there manufacturing or otherwise. So, we think that this will lead to opportunities in the industrial market. Telecommunications, the entire telecom network was brought down, and that is something that's being kind of rebuilt on a temporary basis right now. It'll remain to be seen just exactly how permanent everything is rebuilt with the grid and everything else. But in terms of trying to frame the opportunity, it's really difficult, I mean the numbers we're seeing out of Puerto Rico right now are well, well above historical averages. And the question really is, is that sustainable? And so as the grid is rebuilt, we're going to have to look towards – I think the industrial – the commercial and industrial opportunities are real. There is some residential opportunity there, but certainly the demographics there are different than we would see in places like Florida or Texas, where some of these other events happened. So, that will likely temper also some of the potential upside as it relates to certain products like home standby. But nonetheless – and they also had a major outage there last year, the utility company there being in receivership when they basically had a major outage last September. So, we were already seeing very good demand there. So, this has just taken it to a completely – frankly a ridiculous place in terms of the amount of product that is being requested there and being shipped there. But it's right around – now it's all about logistics, it's just difficult, and we don't have a tremendous amount of distribution on the island either, that's another, I think, an important point in terms of what our potential upside is there, that'll build out over the next several years, but it will take time.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks a lot, Aaron.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Ross.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Ross.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, I just want to make sure I understood the guide in the implied fourth quarter. I mean, I think basically you're implying flattish revenue Q3 to Q4, but you got EBITDA up like $20 million. I mean, is that really just the mix impact from the standby business?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, there'll be a – this is York, there will be a large mix shift. So, Q3, we mentioned the majority of the year-over-year increase on resi was portable driven. That'll shift the other way in Q4 as we are in the process of replenishing our portables. We're ramping up home standby and shipping, we expect to – demand is high for home standby here with the afterglow of the events, and expect to ship a lot of home standby in Q4. So, big mix shift drives a big sequential improvement in gross margins, which drives the improvement in EBITDA margins.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. In terms of like the production ramp for home standby, I mean, do you think you'll get where you need to be in the fourth quarter, because I think it's been highlighted in the local press, and so forth you've got some local labor constraints and so forth. And it's been a while since you've had to really ramp up production, just trying to get at whether or not this – where the ramp up, whether it stretches into 2018 or do you kind of get where you need to be by the end of the year?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great question, Ross. I mean, we were able to ramp actually very quickly with – we do have access to some labor, you're right. The constraints that I think a lot of companies are facing not only in this part of the country, but really with 3% unemployment, people have been some of the larger constraints. Historically, looking back like with Sandy, the constraint was clearly supply chain. So we hadn't oriented our supply chain. We didn't have a safety stocking strategy around component strategies and things that allowed us to rapidly kind of expand production. We changed all that post-Sandy and now obviously we've been waiting to test that. It's been four years – five years since we've been able to really put that into test. But we actually were able to ramp very quickly here in October, and we're going to sustain an elevated level through the end of the year and really into the early part of next year, we kind of watch – obviously we're watching all these leading indicators. We'll see how they flow through to – as I mentioned before, to close rates, to understand just how to translate into demand. But, we would expect if you look at the normal cadence off of events like this, the year following a major event is going to have elevated demand for these types of products. They typically come in a couple of different forms. Portable generators, which are primarily the domain in terms of distribution of the retail partners tend to get replenished very aggressively kind of in that Q2 range post a year with heavy activity, because stocks have been depleted. And generally you won't see retailers, although we mentioned some replenishment in Q4 with portable generators, they won't replenish at the same level, pre-storm, because there is no reason to do that. You might get some winter events, but it's not going to – there really isn't a reason to buy ahead that much. So, they'll replen in Q2 to fairly decent levels, we would expect that. And then, we would expect elevated home standby activity, and really culminating in the anniversary of these events next fall. And so, we expect as we said Q4 is going to be very busy for us this year, we'll keep the elevated production levels as long as it makes sense. And even though we have some labor constraints, we're able to make up for some of those constraints with overtime and working weekends, and we're pushing the team pretty hard right now, but they're responding very well, and actually really happy with how quickly they were able to ramp up and maintain the kind of expectations we have – the high expectations we have of an operating environment with high quality and high productivity. So, we're very pleased with that at this point.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks, Aaron. And could you give me just some better sense as to what type of demand response you saw from standby outside of the storm affected regions. Just more from a brand awareness standpoint in the rest of the country, did you see a pickup in demand in the Northeast, for example, just because people kind of were reliving the experience they went through in Sandy five years ago by watching the TV, what was going on in the Southeast?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's interesting, the spillover effect you get. We saw improved activations in every region. And so, it was really interesting. The Northeast has been, as we called out, up until I think maybe the second quarter of this year, I think the Northeast we found a bottom there, finally in terms of year-over-year comps – quarter-over-quarter comps, even the Northeast. And we saw the stabilization of that in Q2, and then we saw it grow again in Q3. So, that was nice really across all markets. And so, the impact that we've gotten, the category awareness is one that I'll just kind of focus on here for a second, the home standby product category. When we wind the clock back and this is something that we metric every couple of years we go out and we do a bunch of marketing research around the category, just to make sure that we're understanding kind of how it's trading, where it's going. Category awareness is a big one that we look at, and you can go back 10 years ago and category awareness for home standbys was 30% of people that were aware that the product even existed that an automatic solution hooked up to your home's fuel supply and electric supply could be something you could have. Today, our latest survey which was done earlier this year, actually before these major events, it's 72% category awareness. So, we look at that and we say well, that's tremendous. Now, obviously major events like Sandy, this event like Irma is going to have a positive impact and have had positive impacts on awareness. It's also had a major impact on the brand. I mean the amount of coverage that we get from a PR standpoint, as well as our paid advertising that we do, kind of post outage, has really raised the profile of the Generac brand, especially around this category. In fact, in many cases you can go into regions of the country, where the brand has become interchangeable, it's become synonymous with the category. A lot of times customers refer to the product as a Generac. They won't call it a home standby, they'll call it a Generac, and sometimes that's – even if it's not our brand, we'll get – our dealers have anecdotally given us, examples where customers call to look for a repair or service on a Generac, and they get there, and it's a different brand. So, I mean it's interesting to see how – and I think, that's really a testament to the amount of effort that we put into creating category awareness and the amount of effort we put into building the brand, and I think, it's really paying off very, very well for us in a lot of cases here.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you, guys.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Ross.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Brian.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Brian.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: I think, Aaron, you mentioned a very specific number, did I hear you say $240 million opportunity in Florida? And could you just reaffirm what exactly that pertain to?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, that is a number, that's an estimate by – that's not our estimate by the way just to be clear, it's kind of a public estimate of the Florida Health Care Advocacy Groups and the other groups there in Florida. There are about 4,000 sites roughly that they are estimated that would need to comply with this order, and those 4,000 sites, it's estimated at the cost and this will be inclusive of installation, so it's beyond just the machine. The cost of the installation and the machine to bring these sites into compliance with the governor's order would be about $240 million. So, again that's more of a public estimate, we obviously – obviously, there's a component of that, that's going to come to us. And I think, the more important thing is, we see evidence in other areas of the country where the same type of regulation over time could impact those areas as well and could be a tailwind to our C&I business. So this happens after major events like this, we called this out in our prepared remarks, but we typically see – the C&I business, it just takes longer. First of all, their businesses – it's a business decision or if it's an institution that needs to comply with the regulation, there's a time to get the regulations on the books, there's time to comply with those regulations, and it's just – the cycles are a lot longer than you would see with residential. So the afterglow is the kind of term we use, the afterglow for C&I extends much longer after major events, a couple of years. Whereas with residential, it can last two to four quarters. The C&I business can go years based on either compliance with regulation or investments by businesses in their backup strategy.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then if you look at – back at the Analyst Day, if you look at the comment that you guys made around, I don't know, I think, the term that we use as average major event, and you gave us a rough estimate of this type of event could generate $50 million in revenue. Is this recent activity – the combination of these recent storms something that is about what you'd expect to be in the average major event or does this far exceed that or could you just comment on that? And also in the context that you mentioned you were talking about Sandy, at the time that Sandy hit the Street forecast was say X and then you ended up seeing X plus almost $300 million in revenue following that. I think there were some other events of course going on that it's hard to parse out exactly what – which one drove the most demand or how much demand. But is this a $50 million type of opportunity or well above that?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Brian, this is York. So if you look at our guidance statement and how we've taken it up, the implied guidance is about $100 million increase versus the prior guidance, and that is predominantly residential products increasing as a result of these major outages hitting in the third quarter. Now, there's multiple outages there with Harvey, which hit Houston. But I think we said that that was more of an unfortunately a flooding event, and didn't take out power to a lot of people, we sold some portables. But we'll see what the follow-on of that is into 2018. But Irma, obviously millions of people without power for a week, it wasn't quite the size of Sandy, I think we measured the severity, it was about 80% – I mean, the severity – actual outage severity in terms of hours out was about 80% of Sandy, that was the second largest event we've recorded. And then Hurricane Maria, that Aaron's comments about Puerto Rico, we're shipping product to Puerto Rico, albeit it's a smaller market for us with more limited distribution. So, I think if you look at that $100 million increase in guidance, that was predominantly related to Irma, but I think putting it all together there was demand for all three.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. And that $100 million that was only – I mean you're only looking through 2017, and then, if you think...
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, so that's – yeah, and that's predominantly what we talk about the impact on that year, because if you think about our home standby, we've talked about new and higher baselines. When you have awareness events and major outage events, you have a new and higher baseline for home standby, which is then, I guess, an infinitely higher then – if you have a new and higher baseline, the impact could be...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: The compounding effect...
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: ...could be infinitely higher then. So, it's hard to quantify...
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: ...the 2018 impact if there's a new and higher baseline established as a result.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Am I thinking about it correctly though, I mean, you raised the guidance $100 million for 2017 with Sandy, the home standby demand played out for the whole subsequent year, and that's really where I'm trying to gauge how much of an impact beyond $100 million you'd expect for next year?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think one thing with that, Brian, you got to remember my comments about, we came into 2013 with a very large backlog. And so that situation, we're not at the end of the year yet, so we don't know what the backlog will be, there'll probably be some backlog going into the year. But the ability to ramp a lot faster and the fact that this storm happened six weeks earlier, the major event that is Irma, we'll have a pretty big impact on us taking care of a lot of the increase in demand directly from the storm in the current year. So, Q3, Q4; Q3 being portables, Q4 being primarily home standby. So, I think, you just have to think about it differently. I don't think, you can't – because of the way the calendar works and because of our ability to ramp faster, I think it's going to have a different – I think the pacing of it's going to look a little different.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: And then, our commercial teams are evaluating the impact to 2018 as we speak.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: We're pulling together our numbers for 2018. So, it's hard to comment on 2018. We're evaluating it as we speak, we'll monitor backlog and we'll take it from there.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, one – thanks. And then, one last quick one, just that your kind of underlying run rate of outage activity as you measure it ignoring the major events, how does that look sequentially and year-over-year if you could?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, the baseline averages are up nicely. And they were up through Q2 we reported. So, they remain elevated, and I don't know York, you got?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, even if you just took out the month of September, which had Irma in it, baseline outages were up for the quarter. So, I think that bodes well for the home standby category.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Exactly.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. Thank you very much.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Yeah. Good morning.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And, hey, just wondering about the Northeast outages this week, if you have any early thoughts or assessment, I mean, I don't know the magnitude, but geographically it's been Connecticut to Maine, and I think it's a notably sensitive region in terms of category awareness. So, curious your thoughts there?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's interesting that you asked that Chris, I mean, obviously, it's another example. At the peak of it, there were 1.5 million customers without power. As of 8:00 A.M. this morning if you want the exact number, it's 436,000 customers that remain without power. So it's still -we track it very closely. These are data points that we watch closely, I can tell you by state what they are, Maine is at the top of the list to your point. Maine has – we actually have a very good installed base in Maine. I mean, it's not – it's a state that only has what 1.3 million, 1.4 million people. So, I mean it's not a huge kind of market opportunity relative to other areas, but obviously an area as you pointed out that's very in tune with the need to have backup power due to the – just the age of the grid there, the trees, everything else that comes into play when you get these types of windstorms and rainstorms like we had with earlier this week. So, the answer to your question simply is, that wasn't obviously in anything we've talked about here. And unfortunately our portable generator inventories are fairly depleted. We do have certain levels of strategic stock that we keep on hand with certain retailers, and they've been fulfilling obviously the demand increase to the best of their ability in that part of the country. But regrettably, most of the stock is down in the Southeast right now, because of the response to the storms down there. So, logistics are now moving it further North and it's not something that I think will happen as you're going to see, we'll see a nice bump in-home standby activity there, as we get into – kind of get around the horn here in Q4 and into Q1. So that only is going to be positive from a tailwind, it would only go to increase that outage activity over the baseline that we've talked about. It's been a very active year and because we've said for many years, weather moves in cycles like this and it's just we've been in a bit of a cyclical low over the last several years, and now we're moving into a more active period.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Sounds interesting. And then usually give some other line item indicators for the guidance, I think D&A and stock comp are probably unchanged, but your prior $44 million to $45 million interest looks probably a little stale maybe going to be $43 million or so?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: It's going to be slightly in that range or maybe $40 million...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: A tick lower probably...
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yes, a tick lower than the $44 million, $45 million previous.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson. Sir, your line is now open.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Charley.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I just want to ask on the – how much of the sales are going through PowerPlay right now. Can you update us on that?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, we don't – we haven't actually quoted what percentage of the flow runs through that. And the reason why is that, when you get events like this – this was our thesis, is that, there could be a disproportionate amount that ends up going through it more so than the historical level, because of the concentrated nature of an event. So, but it's – we've got over 2,000 dealers – dealer sales people that use the tool, and so that's expanded over the years that we've rolled it out. We get great visibility of the market, the tool gives us just an amazing insight into kind of what's going on the ground, just how long it's taking. We actually get to see the time lags very viscerally as well, because we can schedule an appointment. We can see the dealers' calendar of opportunity, it's open slots if you will, he or she's open appointment calendar, so we know just how busy they are. Probably the biggest area of stress on it has been the normal algorithms we use to distribute the leads, we've had to – they were kind of computer driven before and driven-off of the important things like customer SAT, and the proximity of a homeowner to that, the dealers close rate. Obviously the algorithm does what the algorithm does, which it gives leads to dealers who have better close rates, better SAT scores and are closer to the homeowner, which is great. But we can't overload a dealer either. So we've had to kind of unhook our algorithm from the PowerPlay app and kind of take a step back and do some manual distribution of leads here, because the amount of lead flow is just well above what we've ever seen. So, we've added a second call center. We've done a number of things to make sure that we're talking to all the customers that are interested in the category, and that we're getting those leads to people that can take care of those customers in a timely fashion. So, again, I think the PowerPlay tool is a great way for us to get really good visibility and insight, on the leading end of the transaction to really understand what's going on with the market.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And Aaron, I guess to that point on the visibility that you've got, I mean, I guess you talked about not having this kind of a backlog, at least it doesn't look like it today, the way you did with Sandy, because of a number of factors. But, I'm wondering do you have – what kind of visibility do you have at least into the early part of 2018, because with Sandy in the Northeast you had, we had backlogs from installation standpoint, some people are waiting months and months and months just to get a slot to have a guy come over and put the actual generator on. I'm wondering if you have sort of any sense of kind of what that pent-up demand just from an ability to have guys go out there and do the work, the install work?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, so because it's so early, Charley, it's still in the process here, a lot of its right now just the actual doing of the – the going and doing the IHC, the in-home consultation. So, sitting down, pitching it, that's where the bandwidth constraint actually is right now, is scheduling the time to get into somebody's home to actually do the consultation. And then obviously we'll have to see how the close rate matures over the next month or two months or three months here. I mean, we see very – again, we see very viscerally about the lags. The time it takes normally from an IHC to occur to when a close sale occurs, to when an installation occurs and when an activation occurs, and we actually see, you can plot it on a timeline, we know what that is. It's different in different regions of the country to your point with Sandy and it can be impacted by some kind of noted types of constraints. With Sandy, it was not only the bandwidth around dealer bandwidth, just getting to do the install, but actually meter upgrades, because the Northeast has notably lower gas pressure, and a lot of times putting a generator on a home required a meter upgrade. The meter companies themselves – so, even before you get to the utility companies, the gas company, you're talking about the companies that make the meters, didn't – couldn't make enough meters. And then, you had the gas companies had to actually schedule the installs. And then you had to have the inspectors come out and actually do the inspection, issue the permit, and do the inspection. So, all of these kind of throttle points happen along the chain. Now, that will be different in Florida. Florida has a notoriously, and especially coastal regions, which is most of the Florida real estate, has very difficult, very cumbersome permitting processes for projects like this. So, that'll be a – sometimes they are able to expedite them after storms, as a part of storm recovery, but it still can be very long. You have certain things around having – needing a propane tank, if there's not a natural gas line. So, the ability to procure propane tank and put it – and a lot of times that tank has to be buried. So you have to schedule equipment to come and do the excavation and bury the tank to comply with local codes. So, we see typically in Florida installs take longer than anywhere else in the country in a normal environment. So, this – now the good news is, you can do installs in Florida year round. That's the one thing we didn't have with Sandy, we were constrained by weather, with Sandy up in the Northeast, once the ground freezes, it's a lot more difficult to do the installations. So, what we'll see in Florida is, you'll still be able to progress with those installs, but the permitting for the propane tank installations, there's a requirement in the state of Florida that the utility be present to disconnect a meter. So that's not the same requirement in a lot of states, an electrician – a licensed electrician can perform that activity. In Florida, FP&L or Tampa Power & Light has to be onsite to actually do that. That's just the Florida requirements, an anomaly, but it creates another potential point to slow the project down. So just, we'll monitor it as we go forward, and so as we go into 2018, we'll provide updated guidance on that. But there's a lot of moving pieces as you can see based on the way I'm describing it. And we really don't have perfect visibility into what those close rates are going to be going forward. So, a lot of that's going to become clear here over the fourth quarter.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. That's great insight. I appreciate that color. And just one quick one for me. The promotion you've been running in the Northeast, just maybe update on kind of traction you saw with that relative to maybe expectations?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. The promo was, the heroes of Sandy promotion that we did, was very well received by the market there. We think that in the absence of these events down the hurricanes hitting, we still would had a very decent quarter around home standby, and in particular in the Northeast where the promotion ran. A lot of nice receptivity to it. We're going to sit down as a team – the promo just ended, so we're going to sit down as a team here over the next couple of weeks. We probably would have done it faster if not for all the things that we're in the middle of, and the ramp up around the hurricane response areas. But – and we'll do a kind of a postmortem on that promotion to understand just what was the take rate, what was the opportunity to move people up off of the initial offer to larger products, because they were entry level type products that we are promoting. So, I can probably provide more color on that directly in the next call, Charley, but just anecdotally and based on the number of submissions that we saw for the promotion, it was very well received.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Sir, your line is now open.
Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: A quick question, kind of going back to Puerto Rico, can you all ship there from Mexico or does it have to come from U.S., I was just not sure exactly on what the EPA requirements would be there?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, so it's kind of a moving target right now. But right now, there's been – a waiver has been put in place for diesel generators for emergency use, really storm response during the next six months, basically is just a – I'm going to paraphrase what the stated rule and requirement from EPA is, because if I read you that, we'd be on the call for another two hours here. Because regulations like that are pretty obviously very, very thick. But effectively, we can ship from Mexico or in this case, we're even sending some products from our facilities in Europe, that would normally not be EPA compliant, so they'd be targeted for other areas of the world with either other EPA levels – other emission levels of certification or no levels, as we see in certain regions of the world. And so, we'll be able to do that for the next six months. There is a requirement by the owner-operator of that equipment, to either take that piece of equipment out of commission, after that six-month period or move it completely off the island. They have the evidence that they can't use the equipment in a normal operating environment beyond the six-month period, so for any non-EPA compliant equipment. Now, the bigger issue of course is that, and this is one of the problems that I think Puerto Rico has is, as a U.S. territory, the downside of that is, you get all the U.S. regulation alongside of that. And so that really limits the supply around UL related products as well. So if inspectors require UL, this is not something – I don't think is going to be waived quite as easily as EPA regulations for a period of time. UL compliant equipment which we produce here in the U.S. to a UL, Underwriters Laboratories specifications, that is something that is unique to the U.S. So U.S. manufacturing base will supply UL products into Puerto Rico, but it limits the supply. So the answer to your question, the majority of the supply is still going to come from the U.S. market. There could be some limited supply that comes from outside the U.S., but it will only be for a limited amount of time.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Wolfe Research. Sir, your line is now open.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: It looks like he dropped. Josh? I guess, go to the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Jerry.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: You folks have spent a lot of time over the years focusing on total install costs and you've got some promotions out offering total installed cost effectively guaranteed. Can you just talk about where you stand in those efforts, how broadly is that available and how are you folks implementing that given how much distribution varies by – across your footprint here?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Jerry. I mean, we have spent a lot of time on the installation cost component of a home standby, because that's roughly half the economics in terms of the bill to the consumer or to the business owner. And so, for as much time as we've put on that, we've made a little bit of a dent on it, but it's not as great as we would have liked to have seen at this point. And I think what's unfortunately going to happen, and I've kind of watched this in the past, when you get periods of high demand like this, the sharpness of those quotations around installs tend to get – they tend to not be driven as low from a competitive standpoint, because there's just a lot of opportunity out there. And so, it's competition that really drives those lower. We've got some things we've done to the product to improve the efficiency of the installation, and some of those have read through and have impacted the overall cost. The heroes of Sandy campaign was really, and this is what I think you're referring to, the fixed install cost was really a way for us to test a fixed installation price in a market. And again, working with our channel partners on that, the promotion itself was well-received. And obviously we had to work with our channel partners to remind them of the things that we've shared with them over the years on making these products easier to install and to get them to a point from an economic standpoint, where it still makes sense for them to be involved, right? I mean, we don't want to take away their economics, that's an important part of how our distribution channel makes money in this category. And so – and that's a really critical part obviously of them continuing to promote and be involved with the category. So, what we really are focusing the dealers on is the opportunity after the install for the maintenance opportunity with these products. These products need to be maintained year-in and year-out, and the opportunity to do that maintenance is one that has been, I would say, undercapitalized on by the channel largely. I mean, they – we have some dealers, who are very focused on it and we have other dealers, who would rather focus on the installation or the wiring job that comes with it. So, for us, it's about reorienting the channel around the importance of that recurring revenue stream opportunity down the line and that'll become even stronger, as we roll out the beginning of next year, Q1 of next year, we're going to roll out a remote monitoring package that's going to be standard on every one of these machines, that will allow for a level of visibility with the machine and a level of connectivity to the end customer, that both ourselves and our dealers have not had in the past. So, that's kind of an exciting opportunity to try and help monetize the sale well beyond – the sale for us of a product and beyond the installation for our dealers. So more to come on that, Jerry, but we're not going to – we're not done focusing on it, there's a lot of work to still to be done there, and we have a couple of things in our quiver down the line, where we think there is some, some technical things that we can do with the product, to make it easier to install a step further and that should continue to bring down the cost over time.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions, and I would now like to turn the call back to Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer for any closing remarks.

I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Second quarter results were very favorable with solid core organic sales growth of 6% and overall net sales increasing 8%, compared to the prior year including the contribution from the Motortech acquisition which closed on January 1. This growth was leveraged into an overall 10% increase in adjusted EBITDA along with improved operating and free cash flow. Shipments of home standby generators experienced strong growth year-over-year primarily driven by increased activations during the second quarter as a result of higher power outage activity and successful targeted marketing initiatives. Demand for domestic mobile products also continue to be much stronger as compared to the prior levels as our rental equipment customers further replaced and upgraded their fleet during the quarter. We returned to generating a strong level of operating and free cash flow during the quarter and resumed activity on our share repurchase program to opportunistically buyback stock reflecting our confidence in our favorable long-term outlook for Generac. We also amended our term loan credit facility which is expected to yield attractive interest expense savings on an annualized basis. Although not experiencing a major power outage event for nearly five years, the fundamental demand environment for home standby generators improved during the first half of 2017 as compared to recent years due to a number of factors. During the first half of the year, power outage severity was more favorable along with improvements in several other key performance metrics that we monitor closely, including in-home consultations, close rates and activations. During the second quarter, activations in particular increased significantly over the prior year with all regions of the U.S. experiencing strong double digit growth. This strength in activations led to the anticipated reduction in field inventory with days on hand for home standby generators ending the quarter at similar levels to the prior year. We also continue to expand the number of our residential dealers and ended the first half at an all time high count of approximately 5500. These stronger end-market fundamentals combined with successful targeted marketing initiatives drove the strong increase in shipments of home standby generators during the second quarter as compared to the prior year. Despite the elevated power outage environment, we experienced a decline in shipments for portable generators during the second quarter as compared to the prior, primarily due to continued excess levels of field inventory related to last year's Hurricane Matthew along with stronger prior year comparisons driven by placement of several new products at certain retailers. Although the typical pre-season buying we would normally expect to see from our retail channel partners for these products has been disappointing, point of sale metrics have remained positive during the quarter and we now believe that field inventory levels for portable generators is more seasonally appropriate entering the second half of the year. Regarding the Country Home Products acquisition which closed in August of 2015, we are pleased with the performance of this business thus far as shipments for CHP's products improved during the second quarter over the prior year despite the cold and wet spring that deferred some demand for their specialty outdoor power equipment. The integration of CHP continues to progress as we've continued to pursue several interesting cross-selling opportunities for our combined product lines and certain cost synergies as we leverage our global sourcing and manufacturing capabilities. Toward this end, during the second quarter, we began to consolidate CHP's assembly and distribution operations in Winooski, Vermont into our Jefferson, Wisconsin facility with the transition expected to be complete by the end of this year. The move allows us to better utilize the existing facility in Jefferson and enable CHP to further focus on its B2C marketing and selling capabilities and other core functions that will remain at its headquarters in Vermont. An area of our business that continues to show encouraging improvement is our domestic mobile products offering, primarily serving the rental markets. After significant declines over the past two years, demand for these products has been rebounding quickly as we have experienced a strong increase in shipments that exceeded our expectations during the first half of the year with this momentum continuing so far into the third quarter. We believe this fleet replacement cycle is primarily being driven by the overall age of current equipment with oil and gas related capital spending still fairly muted in terms of the impact. With oil prices largely remaining below $50 a barrel, we continue to believe a meaningful recovery in the purchase of mobile equipment for use in this market has not yet gained traction. That being said, recent indications are that utilization rates for our customers gaseous-fueled mobile generators in the field are improving which could potentially lead to some oil and gas-related opportunities during the second half of this year. We are optimistic toward returning to sustainable long-term growth going forward for mobile products given the current rental replacement upcycle combined with the potential for a future recovery, in the energy sector and the macro opportunity with increased infrastructure spending. Shipments of stationary C&I products in North America through our distributors, as well as direct to our national account customers were lower during the second quarter, as compared to the prior year. The decline was largely due to timing differences experienced in the prior year as production lead times improved between the first and second quarter last year. However, when looking at the first half of 2017 as a whole, overall sales for these products improved as compared to the first half of 2016. In addition project quotation levels within our domestic industrial distribution channel have been trending higher in recent months as compared to the prior year. However, we continue to see persistent softness in demand for emergency backup power solutions in telecom-related projects resulting from the ongoing reprioritization of capital by several of our national account customers as they focus more on M&A activity and the roll out of their 5G networks. Now let me provide a few comments regarding the trends for our international segment. Pramac continues to perform well with sales consistently meeting or exceeding expectations on a quarterly basis since our acquisition of a majority share on March 1 of last year. And we currently expect net sales and adjusted margins to improve for the full year 2017 as compared to the prior year. There are important integration activities currently taking place involving the Pramac business, as we continue to combine the Tower Light commercial activities into Pramac, a consolidation of the Generac facility in Brazil into the existing Pramac Brazil location as well as expanding production capacity in China and the start-up of branch operations in Australia. In the Latin American region, the demand environment for both C&I and residential products continues to improve with solid growth in sales during the first half of 2017. The financial performance of this business in recent quarters has been positively impacted by the numerous process improvements and organizational changes implemented in recent years. Lastly, our recent Motortech acquisition which closed on January 1 has performed well during our short time of ownership with sales and margins exceeding our expectations during the first half of the year. Although we're still early in the integration process, our global engineering teams have begun to collaborate on how to integrate people, processes and products. We remain excited about the opportunity to leverage Motortech's deep technical capabilities related to gaseous fuel and ignition systems in order to better capitalize on this faster-growing segment of the generator market and to explore new market opportunities. I'd now like to turn the call over to York to discuss second quarter results in more detail. York?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the quarter increased 7.6% to $395.4 million as compared to $367.4 million in the second quarter of 2016, including $9.5 million of contribution from the Motortech acquisition which closed on January 1, 2017. Looking at our consolidated net sales by product class, residential product sales during the second quarter increased 9% to $198.1 million as compared to $181.7 million in the prior year quarter, with all of this growth being organic. As Aaron mentioned, shipments of home standby generator grew at a strong rate as compared to the prior year, which was primarily the result of higher power outage activity during the first half of the year, successful targeted marketing campaigns and improved close rates by our increasing base of distribution partners. To a lesser extent, the increase in residential product sales was also due to higher shipments of DR-branded outdoor power equipment from Country Home Products as well as growth in shipments of residential products into international regions. Partially offsetting this strength was a decline in portable generator sales due to higher levels of field inventory during the current year quarter, along with a stronger prior year comparison that benefited from the roll out of new portable business with certain retail customers. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales for the second quarter of 2017 increased 8.9% to $170.8 million, as compared to $156.7 million in the prior-year quarter, with core organic growth being 1%. (10:16) The increase was primarily due to very strong growth in domestic mobile products and the contribution from the acquisition of Motortech. This strength was partially offset by a tough prior year comparison, given an improvement in lead times for our stationary C&I products during the prior year second quarter, which caused quarterly timing differences first half of 2016. Having said this, shipments for domestic C&I stationary products are up modestly, first half 2017 versus first half 2016. Net sales for the other products category declined to $26.5 million as compared to $28.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. The decline was primarily driven by a reduction in sales of residential product accessories, as well as the decline in aftermarket parts sales for domestic mobile products, as rental equipment customers are more focused in the current year on replacing aging fleets with new equipment. Gross profit margin was 34% compared to 33.8% in the prior year second quarter. The prior year included $3.4 million of cost of goods sold relating to the purchase accounting adjustment for the step up value in inventories relating to the Pramac acquisition. Excluding the impact of these expenses, gross margin in the prior year was 34.7%. This 70 basis point pro-forma decline in gross margin as compared to the prior year was due to a number of factors, including the realization of higher commodity prices seen in prior quarters and the impact from a $1 million dollar charge recorded in the current year quarter related to the consolidation of Country Home Products' assembly and distribution operations in Vermont into our Wisconsin operating footprint. Operating expenses increased $2.1 million, or 2.6%, as compared to the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with the Motortech acquisition. As a result of the organic and overall net sales growth during the second quarter of 2017, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined 100 basis points as compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $68.7 million in the second quarter of 2017 as compared to $62.3 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin, before deducting for non-controlling interest, was 17.8% in the quarter as compared to 17.4% in the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to prior year was primarily due to the improved overall leverage of fixed operating expenses on the organic increase in sales, partially offset by the previously mentioned unfavorable gross margin impacts. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 6.7% to $305.9 million as compared to $286.7 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to very strong growth in shipments of home standby generators and mobile products. This strength was partially offset by a decline in residential portable sales and lower shipments of domestic C&I stationary products due to the reasons previously discussed. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $64.2 million or 21% of net sales, as compared to $57.4 million in the prior year, or 20% of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the current year was positively impacted by improved overall leverage of fixed operating expenses on the organic sales increase, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from higher commodity prices seen in prior quarters. International segment sales, primarily consisting of C&I products, increased 10.9% to $89.5 million as compared to $80.7 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the contribution from the recent acquisition of Motortech, which closed on January 1. When excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency, core organic sales for the segment improved slightly as compared to the prior year due to increased shipments, primarily within the European and the Asia-Pacific regions. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment, before deducting for non-controlling interest, was $6 million or 6.7% of net sales, as compared to $6.6 million or 8.2% of net sales in the prior year. The decline in the adjusted EBITDA margin as compared to the prior year was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts and sales mix, along with higher commodity prices and increased overall operating expenses, including the expansion of branch operations. These impacts were partially offset by the addition of the Motortech acquisition. Although adjusted EBITDA margins for this segment declined compared to the prior year, margins have improved on a sequential basis for the last three consecutive quarters. Now switching back to our financial performance for the second quarter of 2017 on a consolidated basis, GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $25.7 million as compared to $20.9 million for the second quarter of 2016. The prior year net income includes $3.4 million of pre-tax expense relating to the purchase accounting adjustment for the step up in value of inventories relating to the Pramac acquisition. Excluding this expense in the prior year, GAAP net income still increased and was driven by higher operating earnings, as previously detailed, partially offset by higher GAAP income taxes recorded during the current year quarter. GAAP income taxes during the second quarter of 2017 were $14.1 million or a 35.4% tax rate, as compared to $11.9 million or a 36.3% tax rate in the prior year. The decline in the GAAP tax rate is primarily related to an increase in the company's federal domestic production activity deduction due to the higher pre-tax income during the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Adjusted net income attributable to the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $43.3 million in the current year quarter versus $42.7 million in the prior year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.41 in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $0.31 in the prior year, with prior-year earnings impacted by the aforementioned $3.4 million pre-tax purchase accounting charge. Adjusted diluted net income per share for the company, as reconciled in the earnings release, was $0.69 per share for the current year quarter, compared to $0.64 in the prior year. Weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 62.6 million in the current year second quarter versus 66.4 million in the prior year quarter, a 5.7% decline reflecting the impact of our share repurchase activity over the last year. With regards to cash income taxes, the second quarter of 2017 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $5.6 million as compared to $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. The current year cash taxes reflect an expected cash tax rate of approximately 14% for the full year 2017 while the prior year second quarter was based on an expected cash tax rate of approximately 5% for the full year 2016. As a reminder, our favorable tax shield of approximately $50 million through annual intangible amortization on our tax return results in our cash income tax rate being significantly lower than our GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% for 2017. Cash flow from operations was $60.2 million as compared to $59.1 million in the prior year. Free cash flow, as defined in the company reconciliation schedules, was $53.7 million as compared to $52.2 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year increases in cash flow were primarily driven by higher operating earnings in the current year quarter partially offset by a smaller benefit from working capital reduction during the current year. Free cash flow during the last 12 months was $201 million as compared to $198 million in the previous comparable trailing four quarter period, demonstrating the strong cash flow capabilities of the company. As of June 30, 2017 we had a total of $1.037 billion of outstanding debt net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs and $67.1 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $970 million. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 3.5 times on an as-reported basis, a decline from 3.6 times at the end of first quarter of 2017. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, there was approximately $146 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. We repurchased 845,000 shares of common stock during the second quarter for $30 million under our share repurchase program which was announced in October 2016. A total of 250 million of common stock is authorized for purchase over 24-month period and to date a total of 2.1 million shares of common stock have been repurchased for approximately $80 million. On May 11, 2017 we amended our term loan credit facility, which among other items modified the term loan pricing by favorably reducing certain applicable margin rates. Previously, the term loan bore interest at rates that included an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of between 2.5% to 2.75% subject to the company's net debt leverage ratio as defined in the term loan and a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. Effective with this amendment, the applicable margin is now reduced to a fixed rate of 2.25% resulting in an approximately $4.5 million of annual interest savings based on principal balance and interest rates at the time of the amendment. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Aaron to provide comments on our updated outlook for 2017.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, York. We're increasing our previous guidance this morning for revenue growth for full year 2017 with net sales now expected to increase between 6% to 8% as compared to the prior year, with core organic growth of between 2% to 3%. The increase is primarily due to a more favorable outlook for domestic mobile products as well as higher international segment sales due to a stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Adjusted EBITDA margin before adjusting for non-controlling interest is now expected to be approximately 18.5% for the full year reflecting the shift in sales mix, the impact of certain foreign currency exchange rate changes and higher operating expenses from the expansion of international branch operations. Our top line outlook assumes no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment and also assumes a power outage severity level for the remainder of the year similar to that experienced during 2016 excluding the impact of Hurricane Matthew. As a reminder, should the baseline power outage environment improve or if there is a major power outage event in 2017, it is likely we could exceed these expectations. For historical perspective, an average major outage event could add up to $50 million of additional sales depending on a number of variables, and would likely result in an improvement in consolidated margins due to a higher mix of residential products. We expect the third quarter and fourth quarter revenues to be approximately equally weighted, while adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to notably increase throughout the second half with third quarter margins expected to improve approximately 100 to 125 basis points as compared to the second quarter. Importantly recall that we have a majority ownership position in Pramac and as such there is a minority non-controlling interest with this acquisition that must be deducted when forecasting adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS for the full year similar to the presentation reflected in the reconciliation schedules included with this morning's earnings release. Operating and free cash flow generation is forecasted to further improve during the second half benefiting from the strong conversion of adjusted net income which is expected to be over 90% for the full year. In addition, we're providing an update on several other guidance details to help model the company's earnings per share and cash flows for full year 2017. As a result of the amendment of our term loan credit facility, we now expect interest expense to be in the range of $44 million to $45 million. The forecast includes $40.5 million to $41.5 million of cash outflow for debt service costs plus approximately $3.5 million for deferred financing cost and original issue discount amortization. Cash taxes are now expected to be approximately $23 million to $24 million which translates into an anticipated full year 2017 cash income tax rate of approximately 14% As previously mentioned, our GAAP income tax rate is projected to be approximately 36% in 2017. Depreciation expense is now forecasted to be approximately $23 million to $23.5 million. GAAP intangible amortization expense in the year is now expected to be approximately $29 million to $29.5 million. Stock compensation expense is expected to be approximately $11 million to $11.5 million and capital expenditures for 2017 are now forecasted to be approximately 2% of our forecasted net sales for the year. When considering our term loan refinancing, adjusted outlook for cash taxes and updated share count from our share repurchase activity, we expect that our adjusted EPS will be favorably impacted relative to last quarter's forecast. As a result, despite the changes in our guidance this morning, we expect our adjusted EPS for the full year to remain in line with our previous forecast. This concludes our prepared remarks and at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning guys.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, so just if you could unpack a little bit the changes in the EBITDA margin guidance from 19%-19.5% to 18.5%, sounds like there's a little mix FX transaction. Maybe just talk a little bit more about the marketing initiatives and commodity, just the moving pieces there would be helpful, thanks.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Jeff. This is York. So you're right. So when you look at the margin guide mix relative to previous guidance, our mobile products business has really exceeded expectations. The stronger euro is translating our European businesses at a higher rate than they were – than our previous forecast. So just that alone, that mix shift should take margins down a bit. On the cost side, in our release we mentioned some transactional FX impacts with the euro strengthening, to the extent they're doing business in other currencies, that's just going to put some pressure on some of those margins on the international side. So those are the two main drivers. I think you mentioned the promotional environment, the promotional environment relative to prior year we're not expecting big differences from prior year in the promotional environment. So that's not as much of an impact. Commodities, if you look at steel, steel's actually – you know about flattish with where it was in prior year. We do have lags – copper has taken our leg up, but we do have lags with our supply chain and it's got to get through inventory. So – that will – any recent fluctuations in commodities will lag in into prior years. So you know, I think, – those are the moving parts when we looked at our forecasts for the updated outlook.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And then it sounds like you're out with – with the warranty plus the service promotion. Any kind of feedback you'd been getting early traction on that promotion? Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Jeff, this is Aaron. Yeah, that promotion – we ran it, the first time we ran it was last year. And as I said before I think previously on some other calls, we've been changing our cadence. Most of our promotional activity frankly has been aimed at channel in the past. And so we've been, over the last, I would say, 12 to 18 months been gradually shifting to doing a little bit more what we refer to around here as pull promotion. So a little bit more targeted at the end user and consumer. And so – you'll see that the promotion you're referring to right now is a great example of one of those promotions where we're offering extended warranty with that – also with a free first year of maintenance on the product. It's been very well received. We just rolled it out a week ago so it's pretty early innings here in terms of receptivity. But all indications as we discussed with our channel partners ahead of rollout was that they believed that it would have a very favorable impact on end demand. And in fact, we've been seeing that as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, in addition to a stronger power outage environment in the first half of the year, we did a similar type promotion, not quite as aggressive as this one earlier in the year and it also had very good uptake. So we're optimistic that this one will also help us stimulate and get some people who might otherwise sit on the fence get them to buy home standby generator.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Company LLC: Good morning, Aaron. Good morning, York.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Brian.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Brian.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Company LLC: I'm just going to first build on the last question. In terms of other things that you can do to drive sales in the home standby market – you've done so much over the last five to seven years call it – with PowerPlay and other initiatives. You know what else is there at this point given all that you've done like what are the top two or three things maybe the sort of an analyst day preview I guess, but to drive sales and move the needle there?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Brian, it's a great question. And obviously we spend an inordinate amount of time at the company really pushing on that and prodding that in a number of ways. I think and we've talked about this and we'll talk more about it as you alluded to in the Analyst Day coming up in – the Investor Day that we've got coming up on September 7. But for us the probably the whitespace there that still exists would be around installation cost. So, obviously, the product we've done, as you mentioned, a lot to increase the awareness of the category, to increase the availability of the product by continuing to expand our distribution. And I think we've done a fair job of also trying to keep the total cost of ownership in a pretty tight range. We really think that, in order to unlock the next layer of demand with these products, we need to continue to focus on reductions in the installation cost. And that's not simply by shifting dollars out of our channel partner's pocket, it's really to try and improve the efficiency of the install, to frankly take what is today an 8 to 12 hour project for, generally, two contractors, and reduce that in some material fashion, so to make the product easier to connect to the home's fuel supply and electrical system. We believe that there are – we've made some incremental gains there, but we believe that there are some potential future opportunities to make the installation timeline shorter, that would have a significant impact on the overall total cost of ownership. So that's clearly an area where we need to focus. The other area continues to be on expanding our data efforts, our big data efforts, if you will. We've amassed a huge database, with PowerPlay now in the market for four years, our iPad-based selling solution, we've amassed a tremendous amount of data on proposals that our channel partners have done out in the market. And obviously, only a certain percentage of those proposals close. And it's definitely less than a majority of the proposals. So we have effectively created a ready-made database of potential customers who went through the proposal process. So they actually had an in-home consultation and we're talking, not just tens of thousands of proposals, but hundreds of thousands. And so those proposals remain a very rich opportunity pipeline for us to continue to mine, in particular as things change in a local market. So if an outage happens in a local market tomorrow, we can go into that local market and we can scrape our database to find proposals that didn't close. And so I think there's a very rich stream of potential opportunity there, to take people who have gone through the process and to re-acclimate them with the original proposal, maybe introduce product updates to them that have occurred since the last time they had the proposal, or promotional activity, as we've talked about already on this call. And maybe to tip them over into an owner of the product going forward, as opposed to a proposal. So those would be just two areas I would point to, Brian, that I think have a lot of really great potential upside for us in the category.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Company LLC: Okay. Thanks Aaron. Speaking of all the data that you have, I wonder if you can make a comment or tell us anything about the weather activity as measured by your database in the second quarter versus the first quarter, or versus second quarter last year.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I can speak to the – I don't know about second quarter in particular – was up in second quarter over the prior year, and the first half, it was up as well. So you know everything has been up. In fact, when you look at our long-term baseline outages levels, and really we've only been measuring, as we said, in this level of detail since 2010. But when you go back to 2010 and you look at that long-term baseline outage level, the first half of the year actually returned to that level. So you know, again, we felt pretty good about that underpinning kind of the overall demand environment for home standby generators. Unfortunately it didn't read through portable on gens because, as we said in our remarks, we had a field inventory situation, which we talked about in Q1. It really kind of dampened what I'll call the buying optimism or buying enthusiasm of our retail partners coming into season. Normally you have a pre-season buy from those channel partners, and it was a weaker preseason buy this year, and that preseason buy tends to straddle Q2 and Q3, so we've kind of reflected, in our forecast here, our guidance for remainder of the year, also kind of some muted demand around portable generators as we go into the third quarter. That could all change if the outage environment remains as it is right now, and that's not what our guidance contemplates. Our guidance contemplates the outage environment reverting back to the low levels of 2016, excluding Hurricane Matthew. So actually, we're being a bit bearish on the outage environment in the second half of the year, even though the first half was maybe a return to more normalcy there. But that's just the way we've decided to issue guidance. And I think it provides obviously some potential upside should outages continue on this trend, or should we get a major outage.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Company LLC: Okay. Can I just – is that first half activity back to baseline, does that put you up – and that's up strong double digits in terms of weather events year-over-year then? Or can you – can you put a number on that?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: So we don't really put a number on it as much as – we have, what we refer to as a severity index, which is the number of people impacted multiplied by the number of hours they were impacted, because we believe that the duration has as much impact on purchasing habits with these products as does frequency. So the combination of those two things, we can tell you that it was up strongly over the prior year. Double-digit, you can say that for sure over the prior year, back to that baseline average, but we just don't quote the raw numbers themselves.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Company LLC: Yeah. And by number, I just meant like percentage increase, but I'll take double-digit – strong double-digit.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Got it.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Company LLC: One last question, York. Could you just clarify whether commodity costs in the second half of 2017 will be a headwind or tailwind versus the first half? I just wasn't clear on that.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Versus second half versus first half I think what you'll see is, if you look at the first half, second half, I'm looking for my...
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Company LLC: Yeah. Take your time.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: ...bridges. Got it. So it's going to be – we will – as you get improved overhead absorption, you know we do have a number of new products, in terms of cost reductions within product coming through from our sourcing efforts. You won't have this restructuring charge from the CHP announcement. So you put that all together with the commodity headwinds. We still think that probably it'll be a favorable variance on cost, relative – second half versus first half.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Company LLC: Okay. Okay. So commodities may be a headwind, but overall favorable in the second half.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Overall it will actually be an improvement....
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Company LLC: Improvement on...
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: When you factor in on all the factors I just mentioned.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Company LLC: Okay. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi. Good morning guys.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC: Just on some of the comments around home standby in the second quarter. Sounds like it came in a little bit better. And I guess could you square that away York with some of the margin expectations for full year that mix up from higher home standby is showing I guess in the more qualitative bridge that you discussed. It was a lot of the more negative mix or promotional or FX-type headwinds. Does that better home standby mix in the second quarter flow through at all?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: No. I think what more than offsets that is the, it's the more favorable outlook on the mobile side, that that international business being a higher mix. You know I think if you look at – you'll look at that on the resi side home standby while up, portables were offsetting that, so there's some offsets there that are causing that. So what's really driving the margin guide in the second half is really that higher mix shift towards the mobile and international sales on the increase in sales there.
Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC: Got you. It's helpful. And then just on some of the promotional activity the kind of response or uptake that you're seeing from that, are you seeing better close rates on some of the smaller KW standby equipment or is it going really across the range? I guess where are you seeing that better attachment?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Josh. I mean we haven't really seen a shift necessarily in mix along the product range relative to the incentive. Although it's a great question because frankly, if our thesis here is that in order to unlock the next layer of demand, we need to see a material move down in total cost of ownership. One way to do that obviously is through the choice of a smaller product. I think a really good test of this, we are going to be launching a different promotion when we get to the third quarter that is oriented around testing a position of a an all-in price for a what I'll call a smaller KW machine with a fixed install price. And it's really – it's on the back of kind of the five year anniversary of Hurricane Sandy. We're going to refer to it as our heroes of Sandy campaign. We think it's going to have a – could have an interesting impact, but we're going to put an all-in price together on that package. And really push on seeing how real some of our elasticity of price testing that we've done over the years, how real that is in the market in terms of impact. So I think we'll have a better read on close rates. Close rates are up overall, answer your question, across all the lines. But I think that this promotion we're going to run later this year is more targeted at a fixed price which is significantly lower than the all-in average across the book of business today. I think that'll be a much better tell in terms of what close rates can do on something like that.
Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC: Got you. That's helpful. And I guess just understanding there's a promotion that's tied to that initially, just more broadly is a smaller KW machine also lower margin or is it pretty similar across that portfolio?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Margins in the category differ based on the different sizes, but not too materially. I mean it's I would say that obviously entry level price points don't carry the same margins as premium products or high level price points, I think in most product categories including this one. But by and large, I have to tell you the margins on the smaller KW machines are good. The margins on the large KW machines are a little better than that, but the spread's not dramatic.
Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC: Got you. That's helpful. Thanks, Aaron.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Charles Brady from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is actually Patrick Wu standing in for Charley . Thanks for taking our questions.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Just sticking with residential, you guys mentioned activation rates in the second quarter obviously added a lot of color on that during your commentary. Can you talk a little bit about how that has trended so far in the third quarter? Yeah. I guess we can start with that. And then also on the portables side, is the inventory level, how should we think about the inventory level as you exit the second quarter into the third quarter, maybe even second half of the year.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Got it. Good questions, Patrick. Obviously, we don't necessarily talk about activation rates and things here in quarter until we get to the end. But again, as I said to one of the earlier callers, the promotion that we're running right now has gotten – early receptivity has been good. So we would anticipate that that would read through at some point at the activation level and there's a lag obviously from when we launch a promotion or when an in-home consultation is scheduled to when a product is purchased and then ultimately installed. So there's some time for that activation. The activation is actually a lagging indicator by all measures internally and the IHC would really be the leading indicator. But, so again, we won't comment specifically on where those levels are here through the first month of the quarter. But as it relates to your second question with portable gens, yeah, it's portable generators are – they've been for us for the last seven or eight years been a very good market for us. This year, we actually had coming into the year, the Hurricane Matthew events, which as we said was not a major event. There was quite a bit of portable generator load-in from the retailers during that event. And unfortunately the sell through on the backside in that region, the Carolinas specifically was just – was not up to what the retailers originally forecasted. And so as a result, we ended up kind of coming into the year and we suffered throughout the first quarter and really into beginning of the second quarter with higher field inventory levels. All along the while though, point-of-sale transaction information has been positive for the year. So, we like the sell through. It just unfortunately, there was way too much inventory on the back of that event. Now, as we exit the first half and come into the second half here, we feel that inventory levels are seasonally appropriate and that we have a lot of data historically to look at. So we feel pretty good about that. The challenge we run into is whenever inventory levels end up in a high position, and this is mainly transacted at the retail level, retail channel partners tend to look at their pre-seasoned buying just in more of a negative light. The pre-season buy-in that we would normally see in Q2 and as I said kind of straddles Q2 and into early Q3 here has just been weak. Rightfully so, because right now we feel inventory levels are appropriate. So we just don't think – and that's part of the story here in the second half is we've kind of – we've adjusted for that in our guidance, the portable generators, just in the absence of a major event, obviously, could come in weaker than prior year. And obviously, we've got the comp in Q4 to deal with as well. So you've got – that's going to put a lot of heavy weight against that as well in Q4 once we get to that point.
Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. That's good color. I just want to follow up very quickly on one of your comments (45:17) before I head to a question on C&I side. Your heroes of Sandy promotion that you guys were talking about running at the end of the year, is that a national promotional event or is it more targeted to the Northeast? Sounds like you guys have done some pretty good targeted marketing in the second quarter, just wanted to get a better color on that.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I mean, obviously Sandy, it was a regional event in Northeast, but it was really a national event in terms of – maybe even a global event in terms of the impact. So we're going to run it as a national promo. Obviously, we expect that the Northeast market would be the prime market. In fact, we'll probably over-index our average as we haven't nailed down all the elements of the plan at this point, but as we've done – we've actually tested this concept in some local markets and some other areas, obviously, didn't call it heroes of Sandy on the five-year anniversary, but we did some other testing around an all-in price point in some other local markets, and we had very good receptivity to it. So we're very interested to see what kind of impact this has. The Northeast for us, as we've said, has really been a challenging market. In fact, the first half of this year, it's finally up, on a combined basis for the first half in a long time. I mean, the Northeast market in terms of activations has been sequentially down every year since Sandy, since the year after Sandy, really, since 2013. It's been a really tough run. It was just – Sandy had that much of an impact on that region. So we expect that this promotion, although, a national promotion will have a probably an outsized impact, at least that's our initial forecast on that particular market.
Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. And then, you guys mentioned that, obviously, you went through replacement and the upgrade cycle was very strong on the C&I side. But it sounds like (47:03) at the current crude price around like under $50s, you know, still pretty soft for that oil and gas market. Do you guys have an internal number like for crude that you guys would see that's more of a kickback? And you know do you guys have a timeline for – I guess an internal timeline on when that could potentially happen for you guys?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Well, these are just our views obviously internally and with our discussions with channel partners, but that $50 number is a – psychologically in terms of the price of oil is an important level, we think. Now, we also said in our prepared remarks that so far in Q3 here, we've actually gotten some really good feedback from some of the specialty rental companies that serve that oil and gas market. Some really good feedback around their fleet utilizations in particular as it relates to gaseous generators, which for us is a direct correlation to activity in those energy plays. And so we think that could lead to you know potential upside in the second half. We frankly haven't put a lot of oil and gas related upside in our mobile numbers although I would say that our guidance adjustment this morning, as York said, and as I think we said in our prepared remarks, is somewhat on the back of just general overall re-fleeting increases that are going on – or re-fleeting activities that are going on in that mobile space. But as far as timeline, it's hard for us to say – certainly we can't put a timeline on when oil will be at $50 a barrel and stay at $50. It touched it two days ago, dropped back below it yesterday. Your guess is as good as mine in terms of where that goes in terms of when, but I think the one thing I do know with this type of rental equipment is it continues to age. And so if utilization rates improve, as we're getting some evidence that they are, that means the equipment's going to continue to age – as a result of use. And that at some point in the future portends a future replacement date. So is that the second half of this year or first half of 2018 that part I can't get as specific on at this point. But it is something we watch very, very closely.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey. I have a question on some of your international seed planting around the resi standby, you know whether it's Australia or otherwise – if or if you aren't really seeing market traction there, what kind of wisdoms have you picked up in terms of the transferability and exportability of this concept?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: You know, I think our original thesis on that Chris was always that there isn't another market around the world probably that approximates the opportunity size that the United States does in terms of higher home values, higher disposable incomes and poor power quality. That there are elements of that that exist in places around the world, maybe one or two or three and also natural gas infrastructure which is the other piece of that that's really an important element of making it a viable category in other areas. But what we found and what our thesis was is there are pockets and those pockets we've seen them now in South America, we've seen them in Central America, in Mexico, Australia we believe given that the average home price in Australia is actually higher than most places in the U.S. It's a mainly coastal area subject to harsh weather conditions. There's a decent natural gas grid but unfortunately the natural gas grid in Australia doesn't extend into some of the rural areas where the outages tend to occur more. So you have a little bit of a mismatch there based on our research. But that being said, we still think there's an opportunity to sell product there. Russia has been an interesting area for us to have some very interesting conversations. The Middle East, where there is good gas infrastructure. Again, you see a theme here with that. I would say, even in Western Europe, there are parts of Western Europe where the grid is maybe little bit less stable, gas is present, and there's a need – a need case for these products where you've got – you just simply can't have an outage. So we're optimistic that there's places for this. The one thing that is proving to be a little more challenging is that the rules and regulations from you know – and I know you guys have never heard this from a business before, complaining about rules or regulations. But the rules and regulations around electrical systems, around gas systems, around products like this, around installations, is dramatically different from one region to the next. What is a requirement here in the U.S. is ,you know, looks completely different in Australia, looks completely different in Europe, looks different in Russia. So we've had to really try and increase our knowledge of each of these local markets ahead of time, and then make the localized adaptation of the products, which have proved in some cases, you know the product that we're going to launch in Australia has a significantly different gas train on it than it has here in the U.S., because of gas regulations in Australia. That in fact adds some cost to the product and adds some complexity that we don't see here in the U.S. as being a requirement. Why is that? Different regulations have developed at different speeds by different people in different areas. So we'll continue to adapt and learn, but it is proving to be a bit of a challenge in terms of rolling out these products and finding some headwinds that maybe didn't exist in our original thesis. So, we're happy with the distribution that we've gotten through Pramac so far. We're looking forward to the opportunity, but it just – it may be a little bit slower to roll, just as we make the right localization of the product that we need to have.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy from Canaccord. Your line is open.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, good morning folks. So just two questions.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, John.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey good morning, York. First question, can you just remind us, on the national accounts telco side. Just, I know it's a diminishing part of the business, based on your expansion and diversification efforts. But what's the size of that business right now? And is that just going to be on ice for a while, until we get some real CapEx on 5G? And then I just have one quick follow-up.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. John, we really haven't quoted that as an independent. It's still an important part of our C&I business for sure. But it's – I would say this, relative to where the levels of spending, CapEx spending, were three, four years ago by the telecom companies, it's literally half of what it was at that point. And now what's going to kick it into the next gear, 5G certainly will be an important factor in that CapEx spending overall around 5G. At some level, these products are – they are, without a doubt, a critical part of that infrastructure going forward. You have got to have some backup power source on cell towers. There are far too many critical communications and critical data that traverse the wireless networks in the U.S. and in other parts of the world for those networks not to be hardened, not to be backed up, to be reliant only on utility power. And it's something that we see, it's not going away. The product is morphing somewhat into different outputs aligned with – as the size of the gear and maybe the tower construction changes, in terms of the requirements around the product may change, but we're adapting alongside of that. We've got some new products that have rolled out here for certain customers who are looking at – making some changes to the way they deploy their sites. But I don't think that's a market that's going to change. The one thing that could really materially change that market is if somebody else, i.e. someone in the regulatory space, decided that these networks – it was a requirement to have them hardened, not just an option. And so, we'll see if that comes to pass. There's been a couple of runs at that by the FCC, but I don't know, I don't hold my breath that – we're not waiting for regulation to drive volume there. We continue to engage very well with our partners there, and have for 25, 30 years, in developing solutions that are unique for them and that work for their networks and for their customers.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: All right, that's helpful. And then my last question, just on the dealer network and the characteristics of that network. Obviously, distributed generation in solar has – drove a ton of contractors and electrical engineers into that sort of last mile. What's your characterization? Do you see sort of a fresh new pot of faces to touch on your particular solution currently for DG, or is it the same dealer still doing the 80/20 rule, if I just put that in your mouth for now? So, what's the context for more dealers, in terms of the broader DG opportunity? Thanks guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great question. I would say this. On the broader DG opportunity, there may be some of our dealers in our existing distribution network today that will adapt to those types of products as they begin to hit the market, and who are involved with it today, frankly, whether through solar or through other means. But frankly, for us, we view it as kind of a ripe space for potential new dealers who today aren't involved with power generation as a DG source, right? They're involved with other sources. We see those – whether they're solar installers or some other channel that's developed to accommodate some of those alternative sources of power, or nontraditional sources of power. We're beginning to engage with those partners on the potential for our views on where we can go with distributed generation, with either products that look like products we have today, or products that we may or may be developing for the future. And so, I see it as kind of – in addition to our existing network, or certain parts of our existing network, an extension of that, with potentially new channel partners.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just to follow-up on kind of the margin cadence. I think you said sequentially 100 to 125 basis points, and that would leave a big ramp into 4Q, and I think you said sales are going to be comparable 3Q to 4Q. So, can you just kind of walk me through the bridge from 3Q to 4Q on similar sales?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think when you look at it, that the ramp from Q3 to Q4 probably about half of that is going to be mix related, Jeff. And we'll – on a mix basis we'll sell more home standbys and less portables and less power washers. I think seasonally that mobile business Q3 is very strong, Q4 is not as strong. So there'll be a de-mix of the mobile business. So that's probably half of the delta is mix, and then just on the OpEx load you tend to spend less in Q4 seasonally as you're in the heart of the season. So you know you're going to get some incremental margin on the lower OpEx spend that way on the other half. So that's the bulk of the mix.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey guys, filling in for Ross. Thanks for taking my question. On the...
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning guys. On the margin cadence, I'm just curious on the Q3, I think you said you expect 100 to 200 EBITDA margin improvements versus Q2. Can you give us an idea of how to think about that with domestic versus international?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: So, we said EBITDA would improve 100 to 125 from Q2 to Q3 I think is what you're saying. We didn't really guide that you know domestic versus international, so I don't have that level of detail to provide you on this call.
Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, fair enough. And then I believe you guys said in the beginning that you signed up more dealers and maybe at a record right now. Activations are up double digits and that's helping you clear inventory. Are you guys talking about your own inventory or are we talking about the inventory with dealers? And is it now back down to normal levels? I was hoping you can give us some color there.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah Michael, our comments as it related to the inventory were related to field inventory which is something that we have we have a really sharp eye on obviously. And so really the two pieces there you mentioned you know the additional dealer count, which is at an all time high by the way at 5500 dealers and which is fantastic because I think it's really an important part of the long-term strategy there. But also the increased activations that we experienced in the first half of the year have helped to really put that inventory in a place that, as we exit the first half, as we exit the second quarter here, we look at the field inventory levels on it. When you adjust for those higher activation levels kind of we look at field inventory in terms of days on hand and so that days on hand in terms of activation level we feel very good that it's seasonally appropriate. In fact it's very much in line with where we were last year at this point and is what we believe to be the right level going into the second half.
Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That makes sense. And then just some clarity I think you had mentioned on the other segment, you guys provided some color on the aftermarket part. I was hoping you can just provide about a little bit more color about. What were you guys seeing there in the second quarter?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah one of the things I highlighted in the prepared remarks is that mobile business has really been very strong. They've been – the rental guys have been focused more so on replacing old equipment with new equipment as opposed to fixing old equipment. So we saw that as a reduction in their service parts sales here year-over-year on the mobile side that was what I was referring to.
Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Michael.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the conference back to Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. And we want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to our third quarter 2017 earnings release, which we anticipate will be at some point in late October. With that, we'll release you to your morning. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2017 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Finance, Mr. Mike Harris. Please, go ahead sir.
Michael W. Harris - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements.

I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On a year-over-year basis, net sales in the first quarter increased 16% to $332 million, as compared to $287 million in the prior-year with core organic growth of 2% and a full three-month contribution from the Motortech acquisition, which closed on January 1 and two remaining months of contribution from the Pramac acquisition, which annualized on March 1. Overall, our first quarter net sales exceeded our expectations led by a broad-based of higher-than-expected shipments of commercial and industrial products. We continue to see improving demand trends in a number of our C&I markets during the quarter, as shipments of domestic mobile products increased at a strong rate, as compared to the prior-year levels due to demand from rental equipment customers, as they began to upgrade their fleets. Also, we are encouraged by the solid organic sales growth experienced within our International segment led by a strong start to the year from the team of Pramac. As we had expected, residential product shipments were lower in the quarter, as compared to the prior-year as higher field inventory levels of portable and home standby generators dampen demand from our distribution partners for these products. The first quarter of 2017 experienced some improvement in localized power outage activity, particularly within Midwest region in the back half of the quarter. This has helped to improve the pace of home standby generator installations thus far in the second quarter, which is further reducing field inventories to more seasonally appropriate levels. Capitalizing on the substantial long-term penetration opportunities for home standby generators remains a top priority for our team. An important element of this goal is expanding the availability of these products to the many channels that we go-to-market. To that end, we finished the quarter at our highest level ever in terms of the number of active residential dealers in our network and we remained focused on further expanding our retail placement of residential products. We also continue to drive leads for home standby generators to our dealers through our aggressive advertising of the product category. Much focus has been placed on converting these leads to sales and we are seeing some good progress in this regard as we continue to refine the algorithms we use to allocate these leads to dealers that have better close rates. With the penetration rate for home standby generators in the U.S. at only approximately 4% of single-family households including no major region of the country exceeding 6%, we believe substantial growth opportunities remain for this product category over the long-term. An area of our business that has begun to show encouraging improvement is our domestic mobile products offering, primarily serving the rental markets. After the significant declines over the past two years, demand for these products is finally starting to improve, as we experienced an increase in shipments that exceeded our expectations during the quarter. The strength is due to higher replacement demand from rental equipment customers and this momentum has continued to improve further here in the second quarter. Accordingly, our outlook for shipments of domestic mobile products has been revised upward for the remainder of 2017, to reflect the strength we are seeing in this market. We believe the improvement in demand for mobile products signals the beginning of a fleet replacement cycle for most of our rental equipment customers that is related more to the overall age of their fleets rather to higher oil and gas related capital spending. With oil prices averaging in the low $50 range so far this year, we believe that a meaningful recovery in the purchase of mobile equipment for use in these applications is not yet begun. The beginning of a replacement cycle for general rental fleet equipment combined with the potential for a future recovery in the energy sector and the longer term opportunity with increased infrastructure spending gives further validation to our belief that demand for mobile product equipment domestically has bottomed and we look forward to returning to growth going forward for these products. Shipments of stationary C&I products in North America through our distributors, as well as direct to our national account customers also improved during the first quarter, as compared to the prior year. The continued expansion of our product lines coupled with our execution on several key initiatives to improve the quality of our distribution and the acceptance of the Generac brand by specifying engineering firms are an important part of the growth we are experiencing. We expect to see further growth within the industrial distribution channel in 2017. However, as we enter the second quarter of the year we see the potential for continued softness in demand for emergency backup power in telecom related projects resulting from the ongoing reprioritization of capital spending by several of our national account customers. Now let me provide a few comments regarding the trends for our International segment, which experienced a solid improvement in organic sales growth during the first quarter. In the Latin American region, sales volumes have been stabilizing over the past year with solid growth returning over the past several months. We believe that better end market demand, the execution of several key initiatives, as well as organizational changes we have made to our Latin American business are the primary drivers of the improved performance in this important region. In the European market, we have seen early signs of a rebound in demand for our mobile products, which suffered in the second half of last year from weakness in the British pound, as well as reduced capital spending by our rental equipment customers, due to uncertainty around the potential impacts from Brexit. Also in the European region, Pramac has performed very well since our acquisition of a majority share on March 1 of last year. We continue to be pleased with the company's overall financial performance with sales exceeding expectations during the first quarter of 2017 and strong growth in both sales and earnings compared to the prior year on a pro forma basis. The integration of the Pramac business remains an important focus for us in 2017 and we're making good progress in evaluating and pursuing a variety of revenue and cost synergies. Lastly on January 1, we acquired Motortech, which not only further expands our international sales mix, but is also an important part of our new Powering Ahead strategic initiative to expand our leadership within gas power generation products. Headquartered in Celle, Germany, Motortech is a leading manufacturer of gaseous engine control systems and accessories, which are sold globally to gaseous engine OEMs and to aftermarket customers. We remain very excited about the long term strategic benefits of this acquisition as it gives us direct access to critical gaseous engine control technologies, as well as expanding our engineering capabilities necessary to help us further build out our product lines and our market opportunities for natural gas related power generation applications. I'd now like to turn the call back over to York to discuss first quarter results in more detail. York?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the quarter increased 15.8% to $331.8 million, as compared to $286.5 million in the first quarter of 2016, including $40.5 million of contribution from the Pramac acquisition, which closed on March 1, 2016, and the Motortech acquisition, which closed on January 1, 2017. Looking at our consolidated net sales by product class, residential product sales during the first quarter of 2017 were $154.9 million, as compared to $159 million in the prior year quarter. As expected, we experienced lower year-over-year shipments of home standby and portable generators due to excess levels of field inventory for these products entering the first quarter of 2017. As discussed on our previous earnings call, this was caused by improved buying sentiment and effectiveness of our promotional programs with our distribution partners during the fourth quarter of 2016 in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. Home standby and portable generator field inventory moderated during the current year first quarter and should continue to right-size during the second quarter, as we see the benefits of our pull promotions and increased power outage severity. The year-over-year decline in shipments of residential backup generators was partially offset by the additional two months contribution of portable generator sales from the Pramac acquisition, along with increased organic shipments of DR branded outdoor power equipment from Country Home Products. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales for the first quarter of 2017 increased to $151.4 million as compared to $103 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due the contribution from the recent acquisitions of Pramac and Motortech. However, we also experienced strong organic growth in a number of our C&I markets during the quarter as well. This strong organic growth was broad-based as we saw improving demand trends for both stationary and mobile products in both domestic and international markets. Net sales for the other products category increased to $25.5 million as compared to $24.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of aftermarket parts sales from the Pramac acquisition. Gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2017 was 33.3% compared to 34.2% in the prior year first quarter. Recall the prior year included $2.7 million of restructuring charges classified within cost of goods sold to address the significant and extended downturn for capital spending within the oil and gas industry. Excluding the impact of these charges, gross margin in the prior year was 35.2%. This 190 basis point pro forma decline in gross margin as compared to the prior year was mostly due to the mix impact from recent acquisitions and an overall unfavorable organic product mix, partially offset by modest net favorable price and cost impacts. Operating expenses increased $7.5 million or 10.6%, as compared to the first quarter of 2016; in which the prior year included $4.4 million of restructuring charges classified within operating expenses to address the downturn for capital spending within the oil and gas industry. Excluding the impact of these charges in the prior year, operating expenses increased $12 million or 17.9% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with the Pramac and Motortech acquisitions. To a lesser extent, the increase in operating expenses was also due to increased promotional activities including consumer pull programs that we ran during the current year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company as defined in our earnings release was $46.7 million in the first quarter of 2017, as compared to $49.1 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin before deducting for non-controlling interest was 14.4% in the quarter, as compared to 17.4% in the prior year. The decline in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the prior year was primarily due to Pramac and Motortech acquisition mix, overall unfavorable organic sales mix, and the higher operating expenses given the factors just discussed. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales were $248.5 million as compared to $248 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased shipments of C&I stationary and mobile products and to a lesser extent DR branded outdoor power equipment from Country Home Products. These benefits were largely offset by expected lower shipments of home standby and portable generators due to excess levels of field inventory entering the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $42.8 million or 17.2% of net sales, as compared to $46.9 million in the prior year or 18.9% of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the current year was impacted by overall unfavorable product mix and increased promotional activities. These impacts were partially offset by the net favorable impact of higher pricing and lower costs, including realized cost savings from the previous actions taken within mobile products. International segment sales, primarily consisting of C&I products increased to $83.3 million as compared to $38.5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the contribution from the recent acquisitions of Pramac and Motortech. Recall Pramac closed on March 1, 2016, therefore January and February 2017 results for Pramac had not annualized yet. We also experienced strong organic sales growth, primarily coming from strong shipments of stationary C&I products in both the Latin America and European regions. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interests was $4.8 million or 5.8% of net sales, as compared to $2.9 million or 7.7% of net sales in the prior year. The decline in adjusted EBITDA margin as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the Pramac acquisition. The unfavorable foreign currency impacts from the weakness in the British pound as compared to the prior year was offset by improved operating leverage on the overall higher organic sales volume. Now switching back to our financial performance for the first quarter of 2017 on a consolidated basis. GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $12.8 million as compared to $10.2 million for the first quarter of 2016. The prior year net income includes $7.1 million of non-recurring, pre-tax charges relating to business optimization and restructuring costs to address the impact of the downturn for capital spending within the oil and gas industry. Excluding this restructuring charge in the prior year, the declining GAAP net income was driven by lower operating earnings as previously detailed and higher GAAP income taxes recorded during the current year quarter. GAAP income taxes during the first quarter of 2017 were $8.3 million or a 39.1% tax rate, as compared to $5.7 million or a 35.9% tax rate for the prior year. The increase in the GAAP tax rate is primarily due to a non-recurring discrete tax item impacting the current year first quarter. Adjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release was $25.8 million in the current year quarter versus $30.9 million the prior year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.21 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $0.15 in the prior year with the prior year earnings impacted by the aforementioned $7.1 million pre-tax charge. Adjusted diluted net income per share for the company as reconciled in our earnings release was $0.41 per share for the current year quarter compared to $0.46 in the prior year. With regards to cash income taxes, the first quarter of 2017 includes the impact of cash income tax expense of $3.1 million as compared to $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2016. The current year cash taxes reflect an expected cash tax rate of approximately 15% for the full year 2017, while the prior year first quarter was based on an expected cash tax rate of approximately 9% for the full year 2016. As a reminder, our favorable tax shield of approximately $50 million through annual intangible amortization in our tax return results in our cash income tax rate being significantly lower than our GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% for 2017. Cash flow from operations was minus $4.5 million as compared to $22.2 million in the prior year. Free cash flow as defined in our company reconciliation schedules was minus $8.1 million as compared to $15.1 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year declines in cash flow were primarily driven by an increase in finished goods inventories during the first quarter of 2017, as home standby and portable generator levels were replenished to historical levels following the strong demand experienced during the fourth quarter of 2016 after Hurricane Matthew. To a lesser extent, the timing of certain accounts payable payments also contributed to the decline in free cash flow during the quarter. As a reminder, the first quarter is typically the seasonal low point for cash flows. Looking at our performance over the last 12 months, we've generated $200 million of free cash flow, demonstrating the strong cash flow capabilities of the company. It's relevant to note that Motortech acquisition added approximately $7 million of primary working capital to our balance sheet as of March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, we had a total of $1.05 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs and $57.5 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $993 million. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 3.6 times on an as-reported basis. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, there was approximately $138 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our outlook for 2017.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, York. We are maintaining our prior guidance this morning for full year 2017. Net sales are still expected to increase between 5% to 7% as compared to the prior year, with core organic growth of between 1% to 3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin before adjusting for non-controlling interests is still expected to be between 19% to 19.5%. An important note, however, is that, should the product and geographic mix, as well as demand trends seen in the first quarter continue for the remainder of the year, it is possible that net sales could be towards the higher end of the guided range and that adjusted EBITDA margin could be towards the lower end of the range. Our top line outlook assumes no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment and also assumes a power outage severity level for the remainder of the year similar to that experienced during 2016, excluding the impact of Hurricane Matthew. As a reminder, should the baseline power outage environment improve, or if there is a major power outage event in 2017, it is likely we could exceed these expectations. For historical perspective an average major outage event could add between $25 million to $50 million of additional sales depending on a number of variables. Furthermore, we still expect the seasonality of quarterly results to demonstrate a normal historical pattern, assuming no major outage events occur during the year. As a result, our guidance remains unchanged with the first half of the year expected to represent approximately 45% to 47% of total sales and the second half approximately 53% to 55%. By way of comparison, 2016 organic seasonality was 46% in the first half and 54% in the second half. Similar to the pattern experienced over the past several years, second half 2017 adjusted EBITDA margins are forecasted to be appreciably better in comparison to the first half of the year. This improvement is expected to be the result of the increasing benefit from product cost reductions, a more favorable product mix, improved pricing and SG&A leverage on higher sales volumes through the back half of the year. Specifically for the second quarter of 2017, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to improve sequentially between 275 to 300 basis points per (19:46) quarter and then further increase sequentially during the third and fourth quarters. Importantly, recall that we have a majority ownership position in Pramac, and as such, there is a minority non-controlling interest with this acquisition that must be deducted when forecasting adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS for the full year 2017, similar to the presentation reflected in the reconciliation schedules included with this morning's earnings release. For full year 2017, operating and free cash flow generation is forecasted to improve over the remaining quarters and be strong, benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income, which is expected to be over 90% for the full year. Consistent with the historical seasonality of cash flows, operating and free cash flow generation is expected to be notably weighted towards the second half of the year. In closing this morning, we believe our results demonstrate the power of our continued transformation to a more diverse business, as significant organic growth came from a number of areas across the company in the quarter. We've also experienced a dramatic expansion of our addressable markets through this transformation, which we believe positions us very well for future growth. Additionally, our strong liquidity position gives us the flexibility to continue to further invest organically in new products, technologies and infrastructure across our businesses. We remain confident regarding the overall long-term growth prospects for Generac, and we believe the recently announced enhancements being made to our Powering Ahead strategy will ensure that we are allocating our resources going forward to generate the best returns possible for our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. And at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Mike.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Mike.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So let's start on the C&I side. First time in a while, I think we've talked about couple of quarters now some momentum seeing there a little bit, certainly this quarter. How sustainable do you think that is? It certainly sounds like you're more constructive. And then on a related question to that, maybe just talk a little bit more about how you're looking at the rental channel today. You've obviously talked about an aging fleet within the context of that. But just maybe parse out demand versus age and just replenishment a little bit more thoroughly?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Sure. So, Mike, on the C&I side, you're right. I think our comments this morning a little bit more – quite have been more constructive than they've been maybe even in the last several quarters. We've seen a really nice recovery. A lot of that's driven by a really nice recovery in the mobile business as we said in the prepared remarks. And again that kind of goes to your secondary question of the rental fleets. And our viewpoint, and this is our viewpoint, but at least as we look at the data and as we talk to our national rental customers and we serve them all, the buying that's going on today is in their minds and in ours much more related to just simply a fleet that has aged due to reduced capital spending over the last several years. And that's aged out the fleet (23:00) buying that goes on every year by the different customers in that channel. And over the last two years, it's been pared back pretty dramatically, and again, precipitated, of course, by the pullback in energy prices that occurred year and a half, two years ago. That was really the catalyst for that pullback in buying. As we've seen that return, it's come back, kind of, frankly, more quickly than we were expecting as we said, this was (23:22) in the quarter. And in fact as we look at the balance of the year, we think that that's going to be a pattern that's going to stay intact. And so internally the way we've adjusted our forecast is to take those numbers up a bit to reflect that strength. On the balance of the other – the rest of the C&I business, at least domestically, the stationary business for us, a little bit of a Tale of Two Cities; even though we had growth in the quarter year-on-year in both our distribution channel, as well as our national account channels, we see the distribution channel continuing to improve here. I think a lot of the fruits of our labor over the last several years in terms of just broadening over product line, getting ourselves in a position to win more with the contractors that make those decisions and the end-users and operators of the equipment that make the decisions. We think we've positioned ourselves very well with the breadth of our product offering and also working with specifying engineering firms to improve our spec rate. Getting yourself in a specification, named in a specification is really critical to improving your overall win rate. And so those have been focal areas for us and have done really well. The other side of the coin would our national account business, which is primarily our telecommunications business and that has been a little bit – it's – even though it grew in the quarter, it's kind of off of a low base last year.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: So the growth wasn't – the absolute numbers weren't like off the charts. We just see telecom being unfortunately kind of caught in between this 5G upgrade cycle. Generators are generally put in place, kind of at the end of cycles like this, not at the beginning. There is also, obviously, a lot to be set out there in terms of just were capital is being deployed by the telecom customers, and we just unfortunately don't see it probably being that strongly deployed towards emergency backup assets going forward. There are couple of bigger projects out there that may change that, but right now as we see it we just – I guess, we're taking what we have as information and putting it forward to say, it's probably going to be a little bit softer there for the balance of the year in the national account sector.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That was a lot of good color there. And then last one on the inventory side on the residential piece. It feels like you guys are a lot more comfortable with where things stand today, maybe just talk about how that looks versus normal. Seems like it's pretty close to normalize out?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's definitely coming in line with where we would consider, is kind of seasonally appropriate. I think our hope when we got into the first quarter was that, that was going to happen by the end of the quarter. And really what happened there is the pace of activations – it's really difficult to like pin down which month installations can't get done, and when they can't get done based on what weather is. We started the year kind of in a cold snap in a lot of places around the country, which, kind of, maybe delayed activations a bit. We're definitely seeing here in April a very nice uptick in activations year-on-year. And so that gives us a lot – and our forecasts, and we've done a lot to try and refine our ability to get comfortable with an activations forecasts that's out a number of quarters ahead of us here. And we use a lot of inputs to get that. And as we refine that over the years here, I think we've got some confidence built around the fact that we think activations in the second quarter are going to be much improved. Now some of that's from the Matthew event in the fourth quarter, some of its some power outage of activity that happened in March in Michigan. We are running more pull promotions to kind of stimulate end market demand, and I think we're finding a better balance there on promotion activity. In the past a lot of our promotion activity has been aimed directly at channel partners and I think that's one way to do it. But I think having a better balance of a mix of channel partner incentives to make sure that they're stocking around the right seasonal points in the curve where they should be. And then also the right amount of promotional activity to the end market to stimulate demand at certain, again, appropriate points in the year is something that we've struggled to maybe find the right balance. I think we are coming into a better place on that. And those things are really helping to put that filed inventory in a much better place here, certainly by the end of the quarter.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Hey, appreciate the time.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks Mike.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks Mike.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Brian.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Brian.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Just on the guidance. I don't know if I missed it, but last quarter we got a little granularity in terms of resi and C&I, resi you said would be down most likely just slightly organically, and C&I I think it was my calculation or just backing into, I'd assume it would be around mid-single digits. My sense today, and I don't know if this is correct, is that, resi might be a little bit below the previous forecast and C&I a little bit above, is that correct?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Brian, its York. I think you're right, the qualitative commentary we gave on a product basis for our 2017 guidance was as you said on the resi side down, down slightly given the Q1 de-stock that we've been talking about and really once you lap to Q4 and not assuming another Hurricane Matthew we would have a tough comp in Q4, so that would – those were the drivers on the resi side. To talk about down slightly, in terms of where we're looking at today we still think that, that's not materially different, still down slightly. On the C&I side, we talked about strong growth on the mobile side. You know back in February when we launched our guidance we talked about solid growth elsewhere throughout the C&I channels that we sell-through and markets, and given Aaron's commentary, not only in the prepared remarks, but in the Q&A here, we're seeing very strong upside on the mobile side. So, we're taking that up. And then, we're still seeing good things on the C&I side, so – outside of mobile, so that's I guess the revisions there.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Thanks. So, the overall organic isn't changing, but the pieces did move slightly, but resi still you would call slightly down?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Correct, yeah.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Brian, it's not materially different on the resi side. And I think if you were to – again, we gave a range, right? And within those ranges there's going to be some variability. So for us it's just we felt with only one quarter under our belt, three quarters to go, to change the ranges when – obviously, we've taken up as we've said because of the things that we're seeing on the industrial side, the C&I side, I think that that was an appropriate kind of adjustment internally here, and not really changing resi, I guess. As our comments – the prepared remarks is pretty clear. I mean, if the trends that we saw in Q1 continue to play out here, we could end up – it's likely we'd end up at the higher end of the sales range, which from a mix, just purely from a mix standpoint would take you more to the lower end of the range in the EBITDA guidance. But it's early in the year and we didn't feel appropriate to materially change the guidance that we gave a couple of months ago.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And maybe one more question on C&I. The oil and gas industry in the U.S. really is seemed to have gained a lot of momentum and the rig count has doubled from what it was a year ago. Is your visibility getting a lot better in this business even into 2018, I mean should we – are you starting to expect that this is going to be some really sustainable growth in that business at this point?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: So, a lot of our comments over the last several years actually prior to the breakdown in pricing in the energy sector, we were very bullish on oil and gas. Domestic energy production, we think is a long term play. There is a secular trend there that is going to be punctuated by points in the curve that are going to – there's going to be pull backs, the oil markets have always been. They've always had those sharp movements and over the long-haul, we're very bullish about our position serving those markets. And so as they recover and really it's the capital spending that in the ancillary type equipment that we would provide for temporary lighting, temporary power, temporary heat. As that capital spending picks up in that market, we're looking for good things. Now, does it happen next quarter? Does it happen in the back half of this year? I don't know. We are optimistic, it's going to happen. I guess we're being less discrete about when it happens. It's a question of really not if, but when. And so for us we like the market. We think it's going to happen. We're starting to see some signs. You're right. The green shoots are out there relative to rig counts and things like that. As those production activities pick up, we really like to see oil prices elevate a bit higher, because everything we've heard in the marketplace is that kind of that mid-50s to upper-50s range is really what gets the industry very excited now. They continue to bring down their costs per barrel, their production cost per barrel. So maybe that breakeven point or the point to make money moves down further. And so, maybe we need to recalibrate, and we'd see better things at $52 than at $49, I don't know. But we're bullish about the long term.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Can you give us a sense of that $40.5 million or acquisition contribution, what the mix would have been between commercial and res. I'm just trying to kind of get a better sense of kind of organic commercial versus organic res?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. As we said that Pramac business only has – a small piece of that is portables. So of the $40 million again Motortech and Pramac January and February for Pramac are in there. And of the Pramac piece, a small piece is in resi. It's small; we haven't quantified it, Jeff. But it is small. And on the resi side, the as reported number, it's only a little bit of that because of the Pramac contribution from acquisition.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Okay. So just as you look at the installations – so it seems like res maybe down mid singles organically. How does that kind of frame up going into 2Q, given kind of the installation activity you've seen in April?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: We would think that, that would lead to increased buying by channel partners. Again, if we get our inventory levels as we said, the pace of activations or installations as they're occurring, we would see that being at a much more seasonally appropriate level at the end of Q2. And remember coming into Q3, we want channel partners to have inventory, because they need to be ready for season. So there's – well, what we talk about here as seasonally appropriate, those are levels that – consistent with prior years that are levels that would reflect that. But we think that the activation data we're seeing today, Jeff, is frankly, very supportive of what our second quarter and kind of the balance of the year for our forecast would be reflective of.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just on – so inventories I think the comment was by the end of the quarter just given the installation activity by the end of the quarter, you'd be pretty well balanced?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Correct.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just – sorry, just on the – I'll jump back in queue, guys. Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Jeff.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thank, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: On the C&I organic upside, it sounds like maybe you're kind of hedging the outlook relative to the momentum you see right now there. Just wondering if you could comment on how much maybe in the first quarter you saw some inventory normalization in your channels versus sustainability. I know it's probably a tough question, but what's your feel there?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: On the C&I side, there's not much in the way of field inventory at all. You've got – the rental partners have their fleets obviously, but in terms of actual inventory in the field, that market doesn't have much of that. Our field inventory comments, Chris, are almost always exclusively talking about the residential side.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: No, I meant just in terms of – so it's all sell-through, when you sell something it goes right through to use?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Correct. And the stationary C&I business is a very project oriented business. So, when a piece of equipment is ordered, it's a lead-time business, so it's a book-to-bill business. So there's a fair amount of lead-time and the sales cycle is very long on those stationary products. The mobile product's a little different. That's a almost – I don't want to call it a retail sale, but it's being sold to a rental customer for use and almost immediately in a rental yard, because they're very in tune with the return on the invested capital there and deploying those assets almost immediately into a rental application is what they're after.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then on building out the C&I, you've been pretty busy for years and notably so recently. Just wondering, if you could discuss the medium to long term expectation on the EBITDA margins for the resi versus C&I and international versus domestic? How that opportunity you see that to kind of close the gap between those different splits?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. The International segment was really created over the last three or four years, starting with Ottomotores acquisition, and Tower Light, and Pramac, and Motortech. And as we've highlighted those are businesses with lower EBITDA margins and the investment thesis there is that you buy a company with, call it, mid single digit EBITDA margins and you want to double that through synergies and driving the top line. And in getting – that International segment is all about getting into that addressable market that we had not had access to prior to those acquisitions. It's over $15 billion annual market and why shouldn't we be playing in that market. So, we expect those margins to increase on the international side. And we have a path to do that and we believe they will continue to increase over time here.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm wondering if you can give us some more color on the organic growth in C&I by the underlying businesses. So you had it looks like about 8% organic growth in the quarter, and I'm just trying to understand if growth was stronger in Brazil. And it sounds like on the mobile genset side those, I would guess, would be the categories that are at the top of list, but maybe you can just help us understand, which businesses are up most significantly within C&I, just so we could get our bearings for the remainder of the year?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, without getting too granular Jerry, because we just – we don't kind of break it down that way for competitive reasons. But obviously the mobile business for us was a big part of that. We're talking – in an overall C&I kind of mid-teens growth there. And in terms of like you mentioned Brazil as kind of one area of the world, for us, the Brazil business for us is a very small business and it's a challenging market obviously, I think as most would attest to. But it's really not a meaningful part of the story here. The really meaningful part of the story is the mobile products piece. C&I stationary growth is – that's – I don't want to say it's more pedestrian, but it's definitely – it grew, but it's a little bit more of a – I don't want to say it's a GDP grower, but it's kind of a GDP to two times GDP type grower. So you're really looking at that kind of low to mid single-digit type of growth normally in that business, but really the snapback in the mobile business is really what drove that.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then you folks made some comments about material costs in the back half of the year. I'm wondering, could you just provide some more context, I know you have the engineering initiatives, but on the flip side, raw material inflation, should I think be accelerating for most assemblers, so maybe just give us a break out of the magnitude of the R&D driven cost savings just to help us get an appreciation for what's allowing you to – I think you mentioned more than offset inflation in your prepared remarks?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Jerry, this is York. So I think when you think of commodities, a lot of that what were the higher inflationary pressures on the commodity side are that's going to be in the run rate here in the first half, given the legs that we see with our supply chain in our inventory. On the flip side, we've had benefits on the FX side. So those have helped, muted some of that, those commodity pressures. When you look forward to the second half of the year, as seasonally we've indicated EBITDA margins will increase. A large piece of that is just leveraging your OpEx on the higher sales volumes. There is price in there. We've gone out with price increases. As the market strengthens, we'll get more price – we'll get that price. On the cost side, that's a small piece of the puzzle bridging from first half to second half. But there is still a similar cost improvements that we see from first half to second half, in particular the things you've talked about on our Strategic Global Sourcing Group, design improvements on our products to lower the cost of product. So we do have a piece of that, a small piece of the bridge is that, but the bigger piece of the puzzle going from first half to second half is going to be leveraging OpEx on the higher sales volume, and then getting some price with the price increases that we rolled out. And the mix, I guess, the other – the last piece of the puzzle is improved mix with higher home standby sales mix in the second half versus the first half.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Charley.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Did you guys cover in your prepared remarks the commentary about your expectations for gross profit margin and the OpEx on a year-over-year basis?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: We did not. We did talk about given the trends we're seeing in Q1 and should those trends improve, and particularly on the mobile side, top the sales, top end – would be on the top end of our guidance range, EBITDA margin would be on the low end. So if you just carry that forward into gross margin and OpEx, gross margin should be on the low end of any range that you had for gross margin, and OpEx should be better because you'll leverage the increase in sales, so when you net that all together the gross margin moving down on the mix, OpEx improving a bit on the volume you'd get to the low end of the range in EBITDA.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I've got some prior guidance, it had been up 25 bps from 36% in 2016, ex the charge in 1Q 2016.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Just like I said that, layering in that upside for mobile should bring that gross margin down from a mix standpoint, but you'll leverage your OpEx a little bit.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, the top line will be higher.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: But the top line will be higher too, so.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, understood. On the mobile side, that goes into the rental channel. Can you give us any sense on the average age of that fleet inventory at the rental channel, and kind of what an average fleet is? I'm just trying to get a sense of, what kind of legs this replacement cycle might have on that part of the market?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. We get some third-party data that we track, Charley. And we're prohibited from disclosing it. So it is proprietary data and it's sold. We're a buyer of that data, so we can't give it here on the public call or any call. But it is older than it has been. I guess is the best way I can say it. And there is different ages for different customers for different equipment. And as you can imagine it's all over the map. But in general, when you step back and you look at the average ages of the fleet, which is what we track for both lighting towers and primarily for generators, we see an older fleet today than we saw last year, and than we saw two years ago. And that historically in that business there are a couple of things that are really important to watch. One is the age of the fleet. The other is rental rates, what are the average rental rates per day for the equipment. And then what are the used equipment prices, so the secondary market prices. So putting those kind of three data points together (45:22) position of future demand with that market and with those individual customers. So we take as much data as we can to try and feed into the formulation of that forecast and that's kind of what's helping us get more bullish here as we go through 2017 and have taken up our viewpoints on that.
Operator: (45:45) comes from the line of John (45:48). Your line is now open.
Unknown Speaker: Hey. Good morning, guys sorry. So two questions.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hi, John (45:54).
Unknown Speaker: Hey how are you doing? Two questions, more macro. Number one, how are you folks feeling on integration of all the commercial businesses? Seems like they've been integrated without issue et cetera, how much more complexity can you add to the organization around that supply chain, et cetera? And then the second question is, can you talk about and sketch out sort of organic R&D efforts where that are looking across the platform. Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Sure. John (46:24), from an integration standpoint, integrations are – we've done, I guess 9 almost – maybe 10 acquisitions now over the last five plus years. So we've gotten a little bit better at it. I'd like to think every time we do an acquisition, I think we have an improved approach every time, continuous improvement, like any company. Some of the acquisitions also depends; some of the acquisitions are operated more standalone Motortech is a much more standalone company. It's a component supplier to the industry. And so, the benefits of deep integration there are more limited. It doesn't mean that we don't have synergies relative to cost structures and in other areas where we can work together, that was part of our thesis. But other businesses, whether it be Pramac or CHP or other companies like that, I think we've done a very nice job of working through the integration programs and we're seeing actually in a lot of cases some really nice synergistic things occurring both on the cost side now and the revenue side. In terms of additional complexity, the business has become more complex. There is no question about it, as a result of the acquisitions, as a result of our expansion organically. We've had to adjust the way that we manage the business because we want to manage obviously that complexity in a more simple fashion and keep it simple if we can. As it relates to supply chain and some of the other areas you pointed out, one of the things that a core tenant of the acquisition strategy here over the course of the last five plus years has been to acquire companies where it was clear there were advantages synergistically in supply chain. So that actually is pretty easy. A lot of things, almost all of the products and companies that we've come to acquire have an engine in the heart of them. And so, we've become a very large, not only producer of engines for our own use, but also a purchaser of engines in places like diesel engines, where we don't produce engines. So we've become an important customer for many of that supplier – that supply base, which is what gives us the synergies that we look to when we make these acquisitions. So again, I think we've gotten better at it. I think we're managing it, and can always continue to improve on that. As far as organic R&D efforts, we have over 300 engineers on staff here. The core Generac does and then you'd add in the Motortech engineering team as well on top of that. There's – we've got a lot of engineering horsepower. And so there are a lot of things that are going on organically, we've introduced a lot of new products over the years. We're going to continue to introduce a lot of new products over the years. We've got some very exciting product updates coming later this year as a matter of fact on the residential side where we'll have remote monitoring will be a standard feature of all of our home standby generators as we exit the year here in 2017. That is going to be in our minds a very, very powerful tool, in terms of data collection, in terms of home ownership experience, in terms of the customer sat experience, our ability to see power outages in real time, to see the performance of the equipment in real time. There's just a tremendous amount of opportunities that are going to arise from that platform. And we've been working very hard on building that out here over the last two years. And it really is, today we sell a cellular based service as an accessory and we have a relatively small take rate on that. But it's grown to be a nice business for us from an EBITDA standpoint, it's actually a very nice business. The dollars are smaller, but we think that there is a great place to expand that platform and really scale that up and sell a service here beyond just selling the product. And I don't want to say that we're going to call this a shift in being a service company versus a products company, we're still a products company. But adding that recurring revenue stream on a service basis going forward in the residential market for us over the next several years we develop this out, I think is going to be a pretty exciting place for us to be.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning. Thanks, guys.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Ross.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Ross.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, Aaron, I'm just wondering on the addressable market for the residential standby. Have you reassessed the size of it at all, you're now seeing penetration of 4%. I think over the last six to 12 months it's been more like 3.5%, which of course is a very subtle change. But if anything, shipments seem like they've been trending down for the last year, so why would penetration be higher now than it was six months ago, unless you've sort of, kind of framing the addressable market a little bit differently. And I just have a follow-up to that.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Well, Ross, penetration grows with every single unit we put in the market. So even if sales are down year-over-year slightly, it accumulates, right? So penetration is an accumulation. So it's not an annual number, it's an accumulation. A total amount of installed products on households and that's a little less than, right around 4% today. Again, as we said in the prepared remarks, no single region where it's more than 6%. So, we think that there's a lot of runway left in terms of our – we are constantly reassessing the addressable market to make sure that we're – so that's really a function of marketing, right, to make sure that we're pointing ourselves in the right direction where the opportunities are. As we've said in the past, we do believe that if you look at the first kind of fence post in the penetration curve portable generators would represent a nice place to start. And those portable generators are in roughly 12% to 14% of U.S. households, all U.S. households today...
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: And growing.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: ...and growing. So, we think that that represents an opportunity area for us. If people go out and spend the average ticket there is $700 to $1000 depending on the machine. If they're out there spending that kind of money and if we can introduce them to this category, the installed product, which is clearly a step-up product, we think there is a great opportunity to convert those buyers into owners of home standby over time. And that's really been the thesis and there's – it's multifaceted, right. We go after new construction, where we see penetration kind of over-indexed almost two times, what it – the overall penetration rate is here today, overall. So we've seen people looking at home standby generators as they're building new homes, which is what you want to do because it reduces the installation cost. We've been very focused on reducing the overall total cost of ownership of these products, which we think helps continue to unlock additional layers of demand, and we've done a lot of testing, just elasticity modeling on price versus volume. And what we see there is as we can push price down, the total cost of ownership that's the equipment and the installation cost. As we bring that lower, there's more market to be had. And so we're focusing on that with our channel partners first in the installation cost side of that as we've remarked over the last couple of years here. We think there's an opportunity within that to continue to improve the efficiency of an installation, to make the machines easier to connect to a home. And so, we think there's a fair amount of work to still be done there. And so we're very bullish overall as we said. I think that – you just have to think in terms of the raw numbers here, every 1% of penetration, Ross, is a $2 billion market opportunity. We believe our market share is somewhere in that 75% range. So as we like to say around here that's really good math. So, we're going to continue to focus on that.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Still not the (53:27) distribution.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then just the follow-up to that was, how do you manage and avoid an overall market saturation issue because as you explained your overall points of distribution right now it sound like they're at record levels. And how do you deal with the potential channel conflict between your big retail partners, Internet distributors versus just your core bread and butter independent electrician that you've always relied so heavily on?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: It's a great question. So our contractor channel, our dealer channel is a very important channel to us. It's our largest channel and it goes hand-in-hand really with all the other channels. We use a very omni-channel approach to distribution and sales and marketing of the residential products. We think that's very fundamental. When you have a category like this it's only 4% penetrated. We don't think it's developed or matured to the point where it makes sense to pick a channel. I think it – and if you think of the individual kind of roles of each of the channels, they all have their role and their place in the market. So our dealer channel is kind of a turnkey solution, right? So if you as a homeowner, you don't want to project manage this on your own, you don't want to go to Home Depot and put it in the back of a pickup truck. You just want to have a turnkey solution. Somebody's going to do everything from the minor landscaping that has to be done, to the gas connections, to the electrical connections, to then maintaining the product down the line with a service contract. That's where the dealer channel comes in and they do very, very well at maintaining those customers. In fact, it's our best customer experience. But you do have people who want to buy and do these projects. They want to project manage it themselves, they want to save a few dollars. So they might go to Home Depot or they might buy a product online and manage that themselves or maybe they have certain elements of the skill sets that they want to do themselves, they want to have their own sweat equity into the project to reduce the total cost. That's the role that retail and our e-tail partners would play in that. And then the wholesale channel, which is another very important channel for us, electrical wholesalers that we've been involved with for over a decade. They serve the broader contractor network that doesn't buy direct from us. So our network of dealers about 5,500 strong today, which is an all-time high as we said in the prepared remarks. But there are over 70,000 electrical contractors in the U.S., there's over 100,000 HVAC contractors. So those contractors, who don't buy from us in a direct basis and don't necessarily want to be in the category as dealers still want access to the product because for them it's a project that they have – they can put their labor into on the installation side. Having access to the products through wholesalers is an important part of the market. And so, in terms of managing the conflict, we use a number of strategies for that, we use pricing, we use brands, we use product assortment. We think we've found an optimal mix to not only minimize conflict, but actually create the interplay between the different channel partners that is more complementary than it is a conflict. So, it's a dance, it's something we've been doing for 15 years, and I think we're very good at it. And I think we don't have enough points of light to be honest with you. I think we more – if we're going to get above 4% penetration over time, we've got to grow the channel.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey guys. Just back on the International margins. I think the run around mid-single digits, and I think you said over time you think you can double them, what's like a reasonable timeframe, and what are kind of the big bridge items to get to that level? Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: I think it's a couple of years, Jeff. We can pick on one example with Pramac, which as we've said I think we've made public comments. It's kind of a mid-single digit margin kind of company. And we think that the opportunity there is to expand that to something closer to the low-teens. Now that could take time. It doesn't happen overnight. There – a company like that, each one is different, right? So – but a company like that, internationally they have a very broad footprint. They have 14 sales offices serving 150 countries. So there are fixed cost layer to serve that the rest of the world is expensive.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Established.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: But it's established and it's good. What we have to do is help them grow the top line. They've done a nice job of that even without our help, frankly, over the last several years and they continue to do very well in that regard. For us it's about how can we help them not only leverage some of the products that we manufacture whether it be gas products or other mobile products and put that into those distribution – those established distribution channels, established distribution branches, but then also how do we consolidate on our supply chain side to get some of the – squeeze the juice out of some of that. And so it's going to come from both sides of that, but it's going to take a number of years before we see that.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for fitting me in. Two quick questions. One on the telecom biz, I mean obviously at one point that was a nice, very profitable business, because of the reprioritization of those providers just – it just didn't seem to be as much activity. Has something fundamentally changed from a mindset perspective of the cell tower owners, do you think as far as having backup power or do you still see this is as kind of a lull until they kind of reprioritize this back into the picture?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: I think it's a combination of things. Stanley, personally, not having the specter of having had any major outage events here in the last several years doesn't help, right? There's no sharp point around network quality when it comes to power outages. If outages are low as they've been historically here over the last five years or so, there's no real sense of urgency around having that backup asset, so that doesn't help. I will say this, we don't think that fundamentally anything's changed other than their focus, right? Their focus is being pulled in a lot of different directions right now, everything from what's going to happen with some of the net neutrality rules, what's going to happen as they spend to buy more spectrum, what's going to happen as they buy other assets, the conversion to 5G. There's just a lot of – I would call it almost uncertainty, around what the network of the future is going to look like. And so with that level of uncertainty, I think just comes a natural level of, okay, we're not exactly sure what assets we're going to buy. And frankly, if you're looking at deploying capital they always historically have deployed it first for the site and then they come back around and add a generator later. You can operate the site without the generator. You just take the risk that if power goes out in that area that you may not. I think the one thing that really continues to be in our favor, it's really two things. Its power quality, just longer term is going to continue to be poor because of the fundamental problem with the electrical infrastructure in this country. Nothing's been done to address that in any material way at this point. So that's going to remain out there. And secondarily, this has now become from an economic standpoint, you're buying – we're all buying our wireless plans are pay by the drink basically, right. So if a site goes down, it's not as simple as us not being able to make a call anymore, which is true, but the data can't be transmitted either, and because you're billed on a data basis, there's actually an economic penalty to many of the telecom carriers when the site is dark. So they have an incentive obviously to make sure that there's as much uptime. You want five or six nines of uptime quality on each site, simply for that very reason economically.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No. That's fair. And then talking about the C&I business, the momentum you see there. Obviously, I understand kind of how that can move to top line, then the margin impact from that. So thinking about the residential business though and the (01:01:28) activations that you're seeing kind of pick-up post some of the storm activity, is that within that same calculus of higher revenues and maybe lower end of the margin frame or is that a potential surprise to the upside, when we think about things absent any sort of (01:01:47)?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: No, certainly not lower margin. The mix for resi would put you towards better margins, not worse...
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: ...within the category. It's really – our guidance kind of contemplates the fact that there was this field inventory overhang a bit, which extended here into the beginning of the second quarter, just because of the broad timing of the activations and when they happen, instead of happening in March that lift, it's happening in April instead on the back of – again, some of these pull promotions and then some of the outage activity we saw. But I think, for us, as we said the residential guidance remains largely unchanged. It didn't – still kind of down a bit for the year is what we're pacing towards. We've said I think the surprise upside potential there is if you do get a normalization back to kind of normal outage rates or maybe a larger outage event. Those things are – and we've always said that in this company. It's kind of – it's an embedded upside opportunity within owning GNRC shares is that you've got this kind of unpredictable thing, but it's all upside. And frankly when it does happen as you guys have seen historically with the company and as I've seen over my 20-plus years with the company, it happens fast and it generally is very, very positive thing for the company. So those things just haven't happened in the last four or five years. And we do believe that there will be a normal return to that cycle eventually. It's just a question of when.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. No doubt. Thank you guys, and best of luck.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Stanley.
Operator: And that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to hand the call back over to President and CEO, Mr. Aaron Jagdfeld for closing remarks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: We'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning and we look forward to our second quarter 2017 earnings release, which we anticipate will be sometime in early August. With that, we'll say goodbye. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Generac Holdings Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host Mr. Michael Harris, Vice President, Finance. You may begin.
Michael W. Harris - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on this Valentine's Day. Fourth quarter results provided a strong end to 2016 with organic net sales improving over the prior year, adjusted EBITDA growing at a strong rate and operating and free cash flow achieving quarterly record. Hurricane Matthew which occurred in early October drove significant portable shipments and to a lesser extent contributed to increased home standby volumes during the quarter. The higher shipments of residential products during the fourth quarter helped to offset continued declines in shipments of mobile products both domestically and internationally. Although, we didn't consider Matthew a major event in terms of power outage severity, the incremental volumes during the quarter demonstrated the operating leverage inherent in our business model. Adjusted EBITDA margins within our Domestic segment grew significantly over the prior-year and we were able to monetize a notable amount of portable and home standby inventories, both of which contributed to quarterly records for both operating and free cash flow. This strong level of cash flow allowed us to remain active with our share repurchase program, make a voluntary prepayment on our term loan and fund our most recent acquisition of Motortech during the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 17% to $417 million, as compared to $358 million in the prior-year with core organic growth of 3% and a full three-month contribution from the Pramac acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow during the quarter all grew in the low-to-mid teens range, as compared to the prior year. An area of our business that remain challenging however was our domestic mobile product offering, primarily serving the rental markets. While average energy prices improved during 2016 from the trough levels experienced earlier in the year, they remain below levels required for a meaningful recovery in oil and gas related capital equipment spending. As a result, this had a significant impact on fourth quarter mobile product shipments to our broad-based of rental customers in comparison to the prior year, as they continue to wait for a sustainable recovery in fleet utilization, rental rates and used equipment values. As discussed in recent quarters, we took a number of restructuring and cost reduction actions during 2016 to better align our cost structure with customer demand for mobile products. Importantly, after the significant declines experienced for domestic mobile products during 2015 and 2016, demand for these products is finally starting to improve, as we've recently experienced a pick-up in orders with certain rental customers, including early signs of fleet replacement activity. In addition, although, we're not yet seeing any meaningful increased demand related to oil and gas drilling and production sites, oil prices appear to have stabilized in recent months in the low $50 range and there's optimism for the energy sector with a more favorable political environment that is more supportive of domestic energy production. We believe this combined with the potential for a significant increase in infrastructure spending is evidence that demand for our domestic mobile products appears to have bottomed and we're looking forward to returning to growth in this market going forward. Now, let me provide a few comments regarding the trends for our International segment. Recall that included in these result is the former Tower Light business which we acquired in August of 2013. Demand for mobile equipment in the markets served by Tower Light continue to be softer in the recent quarter, primarily driven by the continued deferral of capital spending by several larger rental customers across the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. In addition, the weakness within the UK market has been magnified by the devaluation of the British pound against the basket of foreign currencies, further impacting both sales and gross margins negatively. The International segment also includes the results from the Latin American region where sales volumes have been stabilizing over the past several months. We believe the improving results we're experiencing in these markets are primarily due to the progress we've been making on a number of initiatives coupled with a gradually improving overall demand environment. Lastly, included in our International segment is the Pramac acquisition, which closed on March 1, 2016. We have been pleased today with the overall financial performance of Pramac, which has experienced solid growth in sales and earnings compared to the prior year on a pro forma basis. The integration of the Pramac business remains an important focus for 2017, and we're making good progress in evaluating and pursuing a variety of revenue and cost synergies. I'd now like to share with you a few of our accomplishments from 2016. For the full year, net sales increased 10% to $1.4 billion as compared to $1.3 billion in 2015, with the increase primarily driven by the Country Home Products and Pramac acquisitions. Organic growth in residential products was offset by declines in shipments of mobile products, given ongoing oil and gas weakness in domestic markets and the deferral of capital spending within the European region. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company increased to $275 million, as compared to $271 million in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $3.03 per share for the year, as compared to $2.87 for 2015 and free cash flow grew strongly over the prior year at $223 million, as compared to $158 million last year. This strong free cash flow allowed us to continue to deploy cash in a variety of beneficial ways for our shareholders, including making strategic investments and acquisitions as well as certain capital expenditures, while also paying down debt and returning capital through share repurchases. Regarding residential products, with the backdrop of a modestly improved power outage environment during 2016, we continue to make progress and pursued a number of strategic initiatives to increase the awareness, availability and affordability of home standby generators. These include specific projects and activities targeted towards generating more sales leads, improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of these products. We believe we further enhanced our market position for residential backup power products during 2016 as retail placement was at all-time highs and the number of active residential dealers at the end of the year was consistent with the peak levels experienced at the end of 2013. In addition to our distribution related initiatives, we introduced an updated version of our industry-leading home standby product line this fall. This update was mainly focused on reducing the overall cost of installation based on several key improvements and how the product is connected to homes electrical system and fuel supply. We anticipate more efficient installations will lead to a reduction in labor cost and allow our residential dealers to have increased installation bandwidth, which is acutely needed during periods of high demand following an outage event. As we work to continue to decrease the overall cost of ownership of home standby generators, we believe there remains substantial opportunity to further grow the market for these products over the long-term. One important accomplishment in 2016 that I would like to mention is the rapid development of our competencies around remote monitoring. The age of connectivity is upon us and the ability for end users to have visibility of their equipment remotely is fast becoming a must have in many industries. For a generator that is in an emergency backup application on a home or a business, there is no more critical knowledge than knowing the status of your machine and having the confidence that it is ready to run in the event of a power outage. For our residential customers, we have offered our MobileLink remote monitoring device, which is a cellular-based service sold as an accessory with an annual subscription. While we have seen tremendous growth in this platform since its introduction four years ago, we believe more opportunity exists to make connectivity a standard feature in all products going forward. During 2016, we invested heavily and made substantial progress in developing hardware and software competencies required to make this a reality. Towards the end of 2017, we will launch an updated line of residential standby generators that will come standard with this technology and will include multiple service levels for customers depending on their monitoring needs. In addition to providing customers the visibility they want with their generator, we believe this new platform will also allow for unique insights into how and when these products are used. This is critical information for us as we develop future products, and we'll create a better understanding of additional market opportunities that may exist. In addition to our accomplishments, we made important updates to our Powering Ahead strategic plan during 2016. Powering Ahead which we have had in place since 2011 has guided our focus and our investment against four key strategic pillars of growing the residential standby generator market, gaining industrial market share, diversifying our demand with new products and services, and lastly entering new geographies. We believe that our success over the last six years is directly related to our execution of Powering Ahead, as we have doubled the revenues of the company, increased our served markets four-fold and delivered cumulative shareholder returns that exceeded the overall market over that time. But strategies must be periodically reviewed to evaluate their continued relevance in light of changes to the company, it's competition and the markets it serves. Powering Ahead is no different and although very successful, last summer our management team critically analyzed the elements of our strategy as they relate to our market opportunities, our competencies, our vulnerabilities and our areas for improvement. From this review, we determined that a number of changes to Powering Ahead were appropriate to position Generac for continued future success. That being said, the two strategic pillars of growing the residential standby market and gaining industrial market share continue to provide tremendous runway for Generac and will remain for the foreseeable future. Although penetration rates for home standby generators continue to grow and are now approaching nearly 4% of homes, we believe significant opportunities remain to further grow this market as the dependence on a continuous source of power for homes and businesses is more vital today than ever before. For our industrial products, we have continued to improve our market share over the last six years, but believe that substantial share growth opportunities remain as we look to further expand our product offering and improve the quality of our distribution network. Since 2010, we have dramatically diversified our product portfolio to include many engine-powered products beyond our core offering of backup generators. This has created access to new markets, new channels and new customers that have positioned the company for growth in the future. However, our team now feels that further diversification should be more selective, and that a pivoting strategy to a deeper focus on natural gas opportunities is better reflective of the changing market acceptance of gaseous fuel generators for emergency backup and their expanded use in continuous-duty and prime-rated applications. As part of this strategic shift, on January 1 of this year, we acquired Motortech, which allows us to build on our gas engine design technologies and competencies. Headquartered in Celle, Germany, Motortech is a leading manufacturer of gaseous-engine control systems and components, which are sold primarily to European gas-engine manufacturers and aftermarket customers. Motortech has over 250 employees located at its German headquarters and a manufacturing plant in Poland as well as sales offices located in the U.S. and China. With this increased focus on natural gas, we are targeting to dramatically expand our existing global addressable market for these products with the Motortech acquisition being the first key step towards this goal. The additional market opportunity is expected to be addressed by expanding our current natural gas backup generator product line, as well as by introducing new continuous and prime duty gas generators. These product extensions will also enable us to enter new markets, including combined heat and power, distributed generation, and demand response applications such as peak-shaving and energy curtailment uses. The final change to Powering Ahead that we are initiating is a shift away from entering new geographies and instead creating improved focus on expanding in the geographies where we are currently located. Over the last six years, we have put Generac on the path to becoming a major global player in the markets we serve. We have significantly increased our presence outside the U.S. and Canada with sales outside this region accounting for approximately 20% of our sales during 2016 as compared to only 1% of our sales in 2011. This increase is largely the result of the acquisitions of Ottomotores in 2012, Tower Light in 2013 and Pramac in March of 2016. Recall that Pramac headquartered in Siena, Italy is a leading global manufacturer of stationary mobile and portable generators, sold in over 150 countries through a broad distribution network. The company employs over 600 people across its 4 manufacturing plants and 14 commercial branches located across the globe. These acquisitions, including Pramac have dramatically increased our international footprint, allowing us to better participate in the over $13 billion annual market for backup power generation outside the U.S. and Canada. And we now believe that improving our share position in these countries we operate in today is where our focus is now needed. We are very excited about these updates for our Powering Ahead strategy and the impact it will have on our future. We are currently formulating a number of key initiatives to align with the changes we have made as we implement the new strategic framework throughout the company. I'd now like to turn the call over to York to discuss fourth quarter results in more detail. York?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.7% to $417.4 million as compared to $357.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, including $50.7 million of contribution from the Pramac acquisition, which closed on March 1, 2016. Looking at consolidated net sales by product class. Residential product sales during the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 20.3% to $238.9 million as compared to $198.5 million in the prior year quarter. As Aaron mentioned, we experienced a strong increase in organic sales for residential products during the quarter, as Hurricane Matthew drove a significant increase in demand for portable generators and to a lesser extent home standby generators. Residential product shipments were also aided by improved buying sentiment from our distribution partners which in turn improved the effectiveness of our promotional programs for home standby generators during the fourth quarter. Also contributing to the sales increase was the modest contribution of portable generator sales from the Pramac acquisition, along with increased organic shipments of DR branded outdoor power equipment from Country Home Products. Looking at our commercial and industrial products. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 12.3% to $148.1 million as compared to $131.9 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was due to the contribution from the recent Pramac acquisition and to a lesser extent increased shipments of stationary generators sold into the Latin American region. Partially offsetting these increases was a significant reduction in shipments of mobile products, both domestically and in Europe. In the fourth quarter, we continue to experience the deferral of capital spending by our key equipment rental customers, as a result of ongoing softness in the domestic oil and gas market, as well as declines in infrastructure spending in the European region, particularly within the United Kingdom due to the Brexit-related uncertainty. Net sales for the other products category increased 10.7% to $30.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to $27.5 million prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the addition of aftermarket parts sales from the Pramac acquisition. Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 36.9% compared to 36.6% in the prior year quarter. The increase in gross margin was driven by a variety of factors, including the ongoing realization of lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar, coupled with a favorable overall organic product mix given higher sales of home standby generators. These improvements were largely offset by the addition of Pramac sales, as well as lower margin for mobile products. Operating expenses declined $26.9 million or 25.9% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 with the prior year including the impact of $40.7 million of pre-tax non-cash charges for the impairment of certain intangible assets. Excluding these charges in the prior year quarter, operating expenses increased $13.8 million or 21.8% as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with the Pramac acquisition, including the impact of increased amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company as defined in our earnings release was $91 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to $80.1 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin before deducting for non-controlling interest was 22% in the quarter as compared to 22.4% in the prior year. Given the strong Q4 results, adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company finished the full year 2016 at $274.6 million with adjusted EBITDA margin before deducting for non-controlling interest at 19.3% of sales. Consistent with historical seasonality, we experienced a strong increase in profitability during the second half of 2016 as adjusted EBITDA margins improved 340 basis points as compared to the first half. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales were $339.7 million as compared to $326.6 million in the prior year quarter. The increase as we've discussed was primarily due to Hurricane Matthew driving strong shipments of portable generators and to a lesser extent home standby generators, with home standby shipments also benefiting from successful promotional campaigns. Increased organic shipments of DR branded outdoor power equipment from Country Home Products also contributed to the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these impacts was ongoing significant declines in shipments of mobile products into oil and gas and general rental markets. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $87.9 million or an impressive 25.9% of net sales as compared to $74.9 million in the prior year, or 22.9% of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the current year benefited from the overall favorable product mix, lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar, the benefit of cost reduction actions within domestic mobile products and improved overall leverage of fixed operating expenses on the organic increase in sales. International segment sales primarily consisting of C&I products increased to $77.7 million as compared to $31.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the contribution from the Pramac acquisition, which closed on March 1, 2016, and to a lesser extent, increased shipments of stationary generators sold into the Latin American region. Partially offsetting these impacts was a decline in organic shipments of mobile products into the European region in particular in the United Kingdom. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interest declined to $3.9 million or 5% of net sales as compared to $5.2 million or 16.7% of net sales in the prior year. This decline in adjusted EBITDA margin as compared to the prior year can mostly be ascribed to the large decline in mobile products margins given the reduced operating leverage on lower organic sales volume, unfavorable sales mix and foreign currency impacts with the weakness in the British pound. Also contributing to the decline in margin to a lesser extent was the Pramac acquisition sales mix. Now, switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2016 on a consolidated basis. GAAP net income for the company in the quarter was $41.5 million as compared to $9.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The current year net income includes the impact of $0.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt relating to the $25 million voluntary prepayment of term loan debt during the quarter, while the prior year net income includes the impacts of $40.7 million of pre-tax non-cash charges for the impairment of certain intangible assets. GAAP income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2016 were $24.4 million or a 37% tax rate as compared to $6.4 million or a 41% tax rate for the prior year. The decline in the GAAP tax rate is due to a portion of the prior year intangible impairment charge not being deductable for tax purposes. Adjusted net income for the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $71.4 million in the current year quarter versus $65.3 million in the prior year. Diluted net income per share for the company on a GAAP basis was $0.64 in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $0.14 in the prior year with the prior year earnings impacted by the aforementioned $40.7 million pre-tax impairment charge. Adjusted diluted net income per share for the company, as reconciled in our earnings release, was $1.12 per share for the current year quarter compared to $0.97 in the prior year. With regards to cash income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2016 includes the impact of cash income tax expense of $3.7 million as compared to a $448,000 benefit in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the first half of 2015, we're recognizing cash taxes at a higher rate than what ultimately played out, which is the reason for the small benefit in the prior year fourth quarter. The current year cash taxes reflect a cash tax rate of 5.9% for the full year 2016. As a reminder, our favorable tax yield of approximately $50 million through annual intangible amortization in our tax return results in our cash income tax rate being significantly lower than our GAAP income tax rate of approximately 37% for 2016. Cash flow from operations was a quarterly record of $123.9 million, as compared to $111.8 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow as defined in the company reconciliation schedules was also a quarterly record of $114.3 million, as compared to $101.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year improvements in cash flow were primarily driven by the increase in operating earnings, as compared to the prior year. Note that these record levels of operating and free cash flow benefited from the monetizing of approximately $50 million of working capital during the quarter. Operating and free cash flow for the full year 2016 were $253.4 million and $222.9 million respectively. As of December 31, 2016 we had a total of $1.05 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing cost and $67.3 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $985.6 million. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 3.6 times on an as-reported basis. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, there was approximately $138 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. The company repurchased 1.24 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter for $50 million under our new $250 million share repurchase authorization, which was announced in October 2016. Under the program, a total of $250 million of common stock is authorized for purchase over a 24 month period. For the full year 2016, the company repurchased nearly 4 million shares of common stock for approximately $150 million or approximately $38 per share. During 2016, we deployed our cash in a variety of strategic ways, including $76.7 million for the Pramac and Motortech acquisition, $30.5 million for capital expenditures, $25 million for the voluntary prepayment of term loan debt and approximately $150 million for stock repurchases. We believe these investments represent very attractive uses of capital for shareholders and demonstrate our confidence in the long-term growth prospects and strong free cash flow generation capabilities of our business. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our outlook for 2017.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, York. Today, we are initiating guidance for full year 2017 as we expect net sales to increase between 5% to 7%, when compared to the prior year with 1% to 3% core organic growth. The as-reported growth rate includes two months of the Pramac acquisition, which will annualize on March 1, 2017, as well as the contribution from the Motortech acquisition that closed on January 1 of this year. Importantly, this top-line outlook assumes no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment and also assumes the power outage severity levels similar to that experienced during 2016, excluding the impact of Hurricane Matthew. As a reminder, should the baseline power outage environment improve or if there is a major power outage event in 2017, it is likely we could exceed these expectations. For historical perspective, an average major outage event could add between $25 million to $50 million of additional sales depending on a number of variables. We expect the seasonality of quarterly results to demonstrate a normal historical pattern assuming no major outage events occur during the year. As a result, we currently expect the first half of the year to represent approximately 45% to 47% of total sales and the second half approximately 53% to 55%. By way of comparison, 2016 organic seasonality was 46% in the first half and 54% in the second half. Specifically, we anticipate that the first quarter of 2017 will be the lowest revenue quarter of the year with sales in the range of $315 million to $325 million, reflecting normal seasonality for residential products as well as the impact of field inventory destocking by distribution partners during the first quarter, due to the success of our home standby generator promotional campaigns in the fourth quarter of 2016. In summarizing our sales growth assumptions for 2017, we expect total core organic sales growth on a constant currency basis to increase between 1% to 3% compared to the prior year, with approximately a 1% negative impact from foreign currency. The acquisitions of Pramac and Motortech are expected to contribute roughly 5% growth for a total year-over-year as-reported net sales increase between 5% to 7%. With regards to gross margins, recall that 2016 included a restructuring charge related to domestic mobile products and certain purchase accounting adjustments related to the Pramac acquisition. When excluding the $6.1 million or 40 basis point impact from these non-recurring expenses in 2016, gross margins for 2017 are still forecasted to improve by approximately 25 basis points as compared to the prior year. Favorable impacts to gross margin are expected to come from pricing benefits, along with a variety of cost improvements related to new products, engineered cost reduction and sourcing savings from our increased scale and stronger U.S. dollar. Partially offsetting these favorable benefits are impacts from unfavorable product mix, higher commodities and the additional two months contribution from the Pramac acquisition. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the amortization of intangibles and the $4.4 million or 30 basis points impact from the non-recurring restructuring charge recorded in the first quarter of 2016 are forecasted to increase by approximately 25 basis points as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the impact from the Pramac and Motortech acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year 2017 before adjusting for non-controlling interest are expected to be between 19% to 19.5% as compared to 19.3% for 2016 with some variation throughout the year as a result of normal seasonality. Similar to the pattern experienced over the past several years, second half 2017 adjusted EBITDA margins are forecasted to be approximately 450 basis points to 500 basis points higher than the first half as a result of the increasing benefit from product cost reductions, a more favorable product mix, improved pricing and SG&A leverage on higher sales volumes through the back half of the year. Specifically, adjusted EBITDA margins in the first quarter of 2017 are expected to represent the lowest point of the year, with margins improving sequentially in the second quarter by approximately 300 basis points and then increasing sequentially during the third and fourth quarters. I'll now turn the call back over to York to walk through some guidance details to help model out the company's cash flows and earnings per share for 2017. York?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Aaron. In 2017, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $46.5 million to $47.5 million, which represents an increase compared to $44.6 million for the prior year. The primary driver of the increase is the assumption that LIBOR rate exceeds the minimum floor of 0.75% on our term loan for the entire year. The forecast for interest expense includes $44 million to $45 million of cash for debt service costs, plus approximately $2.5 million for deferred financing cost and originally issue discount amortization for our credit facility. This interest expense guidance assumes no additional debt prepayments during 2017 and our existing interest rate swap contracts remain in place. Based on our guidance provided for 2017, our cash income taxes for the year are expected to be approximately $26 million to $27 million, which translates into an anticipated full-year 2017 cash income tax rate of approximately 14%. This represents a notable increase as compared to the 5.9% rate in 2016. The projected higher cash income tax rate is a function of several factors, most notably higher pre-tax profitability levels, as well as expected reduction in share-based compensation expense for tax purposes during 2017 compared to the prior year. Our GAAP income tax rate is projected to be approximately 35% in 2017. Depreciation expense in 2017 is forecasted to be approximately $21.5 million to $22 million. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2017 is expected to be approximately $29 million to $29.5 million, which is a reduction from the $33 million in 2016. The decline in expense is primarily the result of certain definite-live intangibles becoming fully amortized during 2016. In 2017, GAAP stock compensation expense is expected to increase to approximately $11 million to $11.5 million. Our capital expenditures for 2017 are forecasted to be approximately 2.5% of our forecasted net sales for the year. Importantly, recall that we have a majority ownership position in Pramac and there was a minority non-controlling interest with this acquisition that must be deducted when forecasting adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS for the full year 2017 similar to the presentation reflected in the reconciliation schedules included with our earnings release. For full year 2017, free cash flow generation is expected to be strong, benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income expected to be over 90% in 2017. In closing this morning, sales of residential products during 2016 increased organically, as our market position remains strong. Business conditions in several of our C&I end markets remained soft during 2016, but we believe demand trends in a number of these markets are at or near the bottom, and we're cautiously optimistic in returning to organic growth during 2017. As we look at our outlook for 2017, we believe our Powering Ahead strategy is working, as the business has become more diversified in recent years. We remain optimistic regarding our overall long-term growth prospects and our strong cash flow generation capabilities give us the flexibly to make strategic investments that we believe will increase shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.
James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. This is James Picariello on for Jeff.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Well, good morning. good morning, James.
James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So, you mentioned this pivot in the Powering Ahead strategy away from regional expansion and now primarily focused on natural gas applications, it makes a lot of sense. Could you just talk about when this revelation occurred internally, and maybe how you're thinking about the company's current portfolio as it stands? Is there anything you would consider non-core at this point?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So, James, every year we do a strategic planning session, and review with our management team here at the company and with the board of directors obviously and we go through – again, we evaluate our strengths, our weaknesses. It's kind of classic SWOT analysis where you start, our position in each of the markets we're in, what's working, what's not working, where we think – kind of where is the puck going to be as we look out three years to five years. And in this year's session, I think – and maybe this has been tugging at us a bit, but really the pivot for us is this element of our strategy that's actually played a really significant part in actually York's final prepared remarks there a significant part, and I think the diversification of Generac, that part of the strategy of going after new products and new markets, we feel that we have become very diversified. We've gotten ourselves into a lot of new markets, a lot of new product categories that we weren't in before. They all have an engine at the heart of them, which is what we like. They provide some great scale for us in terms of not only a manufacturer of engines, but a customer of engine suppliers. And a lot of the new markets that we got into was great for the adjacencies that they gave us for our products – our existing product line. But also, I think we all feel that to go further from where we're at today might be a bit dilutive in terms of our focus. And so, we've been feeling that as we've slowly diversified the company. I think it's been clear to us that we needed to probably rein that in a bit. And I wouldn't say that coming from that analysis there is anything that we say doesn't belong anymore. I think we're comfortable with what we've got, and what we've amassed. And we may full well add some other products that are real close to, in the way they operate and the markets that are served by those products, we may continue to do that. We're just not going to make it a primary focus of our strategy going forward. So the pivot is really to – one of our major strengths, which has been natural gas generators for over 30 years, we've been a leader in emergency backup gas generators, and we believe that we can extend that leadership on emergency backup generators into some of the other places that natural gas is showing up, not only in energy combined heat/power type applications, demand response, there is utility curtailment programs, there is a lot of places where generators that may have traditionally been used in an emergency-only situation are now starting to be looked at as a potential way to actually cut energy cost. The natural gas obviously is viewed as a very clean fuel source, and it's also going to be a very readily available fuel source for a long, long time. Natural gas is going to be the world's fuel supply for at least the next 100 years, I mean the economics in favor there are far too strong. So the acquisition of Motortech that we just recently announced here, we believe is a really good step in the right direction of this pivoting strategy to a much deeper focus on natural gas, not only strengthening the existing positions we have in the market, but then going after some of these other market opportunities, and we think Motortech is going to really put us in a position to learn those markets and to begin to formulate initiatives as I said to go after those opportunities. So that's really the pivot that we're talking about.
James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Very helpful. And then just on International margins, can your provide some additional color on what's driving that segment's lower profitability? You mentioned UK weakness. So to what extent is FX just playing a factor there? And then with respect to the ongoing integration efforts at Pramac, can you just maybe provide some range on what the targeted revenue and cost out synergies are for this year? Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So I'll start the – the margins in International, I think were challenging this year. That segment has largely been our Tower Light business along with our Ottomotores business down in Latin America. And we're in a very fortunate position to be supplying the market in a very favorable way with products that that had very good margins and they still do have very good margins as a matter of fact, it's just unfortunately the Tower Light business in particular, we saw a breakdown in the capital spending by those larger rental accounts in Europe, primarily in UK, which is a big component of Tower Light's business and that really was last year, some of it precipitated by Brexit, I think that was probably the excuse if you will. We've seen large rental companies, they tend to throttle back CapEx very quickly. And it's pointed out, I think some opportunities within that business to expand our customer base into some reaches and some areas in maybe the second and third tier-type of customer layers there that maybe we weren't as concentrated on that we probably need to expand on, so I take every negative and try to make it a positive, of course, but that was really at the core of what happened there. And then obviously you layer in the Pramac business, which is a lower margin business. I mean typically when you look at power generation businesses globally and we've looked at a lot of them, they're really kind of mid single-digit EBITDA type margin businesses. The reason for that is they're primarily packagers. They are buying somebody else's engine, they're buying somebody else's alternator, buying somebody else's control, there is a limited amount of value add in the value chain. And so their margins tend – it's basically kind of commoditized, and so their margins are somewhat reflective of a market that is commoditized. And so you might ask, well why even bother going after that? Well, it's pretty simple. We think that there is an opportunity to take these packagers and make them more truly manufacturers like we are more vertically integrated where there are more value added streams. We manufacture our own control, the hardware and the software, our own alternators, our own transfer switches, many of our own fuel systems. There's a lot more value added content that we bring to bear, and I think it's reflective of the margins we have here domestically in those segments, and so – in those businesses. So that is I think the long-term plan. So more directly to your question about the synergies in Pramac, obviously, of course, we're coming up on the one-year anniversary. We've been able to capture some synergies, but not much, we expect this also will accelerate especially as we go into the back half of the year here. You won't see that dramatically showing up in EBITDA margins for that business this year. But we think it's really kind of a late 2017 and going into 2018 story. There's a lot of engineering work to be done to globalize our platforms, and that's really at the heart of that. And so those projects are pretty wide ranging, and they take fair amount of engineering resource, and they're currently underway, but they really won't – these are long sales cycle products as well, so they really won't have an impact on that business until later this year. Now some revenue synergies where we are starting to see some nice interest is in with gas products in the Pramac distribution, which is also part of that plan. So good step ahead for those businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Brian.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Brain.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: See I wanted just to ask about the breakdown of the revenue for the year first – last couple of years, first half of the year accounted for 46%, 45% of revenue and you mentioned that in the prepared remarks. But the difference between 2015 or 2016 versus this year in my mind is that we had this major weather event at the close of the previous year. So why wouldn't we see a little bit more revenue in the first half, so that balance be a little bit different?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Brian, this is York. I think Aaron – we talked about a steer in terms of where Q1 sales at $315 million to $325 million, and in Aaron's prepared remarks, he was referring to the success of our promotional campaigns in the fourth quarter of 2016. That will just result in a level of destock in the first quarter of 2017 here, so that guide is reflective of that. And then, the reality is Hurricane Matthew wasn't really a major event, I think there was – while it took the power out for a lot of people, it wasn't for a long duration. The severity was short (42:06) infrastructure wasn't really damaged. So, the afterglow of Matthew into 2017 is muted.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: It really was a portable generator, and that's more than anything is what we saw in Q4, Brian. I think what happened is our channel partners both on portables as well as home standbys, they get into a buying mood pretty quickly when they see a storm like that and we run normal promotional cadence those times of the year, and we got a high receptivity of those promos. And as York said, that's going to result in really higher kind of fuel inventory levels as we enter the year here, and there'll be some amount of destocking that will occur in Q1, and that's really what's reflective of that kind of seasonal steer that we gave first half, second half.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: So, Brian, it's a fair question, but I think given those comments that that would then cause the weighting first half, second half to be similar to 2016 here in 2017.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, great. That's really helpful. And then, can you go back and talk a little bit more about Motortech and the timing of maybe some of the new products and opportunities that would be associated with Motortech? And have you been able to quantify in any way, how much you're expanding your TAM with those products?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. We think the TAM for those products is about – it's about 1.5 times bigger than what we currently serve today in the emergency backup market. And so that – it's a pretty good opportunity for us and Motortech is currently selling into – that market is largely by the way I should say that TAM expansion is largely in Europe today. And we think that that is starting to appear here in North America as well and in Latin America. So, the Motortech technology and the competencies that we gain there, we believe are going to allow us to put ourselves in a position to capture that expanding TAM here domestically and in Latin America and then the existing TAM in Europe. In terms of timing, Brian, those are big product cycles for us, and so it's going to be something we're going to begin to work vigorously on here, already actually have in 2017 here. And that'll – I think we'll be in a position to give better updates throughout the year as we go forward, but we're excited about it. Because it's – again natural gas is going to be the world's fuel supply for a long time. We think we're going to where the puck is going to be here in the future and we're seeing evidence of that the traditional – even in the traditional backup generator markets, we've seen this for a couple of decades in the U.S. market, there's been a shift away from diesel and to natural gas. Outside the U.S. and Canada, it's still largely a diesel market for backup generators. We think that's going to change as well over time, gaseous-gensets are becoming much more accepted as a substitute, if you will, for diesel, and we believe we're going to be at the forefront of being able to capitalize on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jerry.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Aaron, I'm wondering, if you could talk about for your core Magnum business for light towers, what are you embedding in terms of the CapEx outlook for your customer base? In that business we saw one of your major customers put out some pretty positive CapEx indicators that also suggest the very good first and second quarter on a year-over-year basis in their planned spend. And I'm just wondering, if you anticipate your share of the CapEx budget for U.S. rental companies staying similar or is there anything that we should keep in mind about where dollar utilization stands for them in your products compared to the overall portfolio?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. It's a really good question Jerry, and obviously, one that we paid very close attention to in terms of all the major metrics there around the categories that we serve in that market. Lighting towers have been traditionally one of the better return on invested capital type products that's in a fleet for a rental customer. And so, as you would expect that's typically where we see recovery first, when we see fleet replacements occurring, and where we see capital expenditures deployed first. And that's basically what we're seeing. As I said in my prepared remarks, it's what gives us confidence that we've kind of seen the bottom, we've steered it down and we believe there's going to be a nice rebound in that business this year. We're already seeing order rates strengthening from those national account customers in those particular categories around towers. We think that gens generally will follow a little bit later. The generator markets are little different because there's a dynamic there around a shift in the average sell price for those products, it's reflective of the move from Tier 4 interim to Tier 4 final engine powering in many of those products, including the generator product line that we offer. So in effect, until rental rates are – there is an ability to increase rental rates in those products, it's going to probably keep a bit of a lid on maybe the CapEx spending there, until fleets – I think fleets are going to age a little bit more in those category. But we're seeing some really nice rebound there, we're watching and conversing with our national rental account customers on a daily basis in fact. And frankly, probably the bigger challenge in that business for us is just having rationalized the footprint of the business and done the cost reduction and the restructuring charge that we talked about last year is being able to react quickly to changes in demand, they often come in big chunks and we're seeing some of that now. So the ability to ramp our operations and our supply chain accordingly will probably be the constraining factor for us here in first two quarters of the year so. And that's really – I mean, seasonally speaking lighting towers from a seasonality standpoint are typically a Q3 product, I mean, it's when days get shorter. So, that's what gives us confidence that a lot of what's going on right now is true fleet replacement activity. So we like that and that's really without any recovery in oil and gas yet, any significant recovery there. So there could be some potential additional upside should oil and gas begin to come back on line and those investments be made. So we're bullish on it.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. And then for the standby business, it sounds like just based on field inventory timing maybe the business looks negative year-over-year in the first quarter. I'm wondering if you would just share with us how the underlying trends are attracting, whether it's the number of in-home consultations or whatever core underlying demand you think will reflect the underlying demand and how you look at the business today, can you just help us understand the cadence of what's played out over the course of the quarter?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So what we saw in Q4 Jerry, I mean we typically see a push towards the year end on activations which we saw in-home consultations usually perceive that by a couple of months, which we saw. I wouldn't say that the spikes were as large. Regionally speaking, the Northeast was down regionally for the year and also in the quarter although not nearly as severe as previous quarters. The Northeast still continues to come off of, I would call it the hangover of the events that had transpired out there in 2011 and 2012. So that decrease in that region put pressure overall on those things. That being said, I think that was offset largely in Q4 as we mentioned in our prepared remarks by the impact of Matthew. Now, as you're also learning, and you mentioned, a lot of that was sell-in, not necessarily sell-through as channel partners took a fair amount of inventory, took advantage of promotional cadence we have, they were in a better buying mood because of the outage events. And coming into the beginning of the year here, we see kind of from an end market demand standpoint, very similar trends to what we've seen in years past, not materially different. I would say that activations in in-home consultations in areas that we saw impacted by Matthew are up year-over-year and the rest of the market is either kind of flattish to maybe slightly down continuing in the Northeast still, which is pretty phenomenal, just goes to show you how big that market had gotten, but I think it's pretty stable trends. We've got a number of things, as we said, that we're working on to focus on improving close rates. I think that's a really big focus area, it has been last year, but we've adjusted some of our programs this year to reflect the importance of close rate in the rankings of residential dealers, which we hadn't done in the past. So we think that trying to better use market forces to our advantage to improve close rates. If we could just see even a slight improvement in close rates, it's a material impact. We do a lot of quotations, I mean, a lot of quotations and the close rates are relatively small. And if we could get those close rates to move just a little bit, it's going to have a nice impact on overall home standby demand. So I think that's really the game for us and our focus is that end of the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is now open. Looks like we've got...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Maybe go to the next one, operator.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hello. Charley, we're not hearing you.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Can you hear me, York?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: We hear you now.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. My apologies on that. My question is just quickly on the raw material costs, we've seen copper go up a little bit. We've seen some other raws go up. Any impact on the fourth quarter and kind of what's embedded in your expectations in 2017?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Charley. This is York. Yeah. In Q4 – starting with Q4, so we have realization lag, as you can imagine, with our supply chain and through our inventory. So what we're seeing come through Q4 can be commodity levels from six months ago or more. So we actually had a tailwind in Q4 relative to commodities and whatnot. But when you do flash-forward to 2017, you're right, copper, steel, aluminum are all up and trending up. So what we need to do is put initiatives in place from an engineered cost reduction standpoint, a sourcing standpoint, a pricing operating standpoint to help offset those headwinds on the commodity side. So, we did bake in some level of commodity pressures in our guide, but we also did include some price and some engineered and sourcing cost reductions to help offset. So that was reflected in our gross margin guidance for 2017.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And so, let me go back to commentary in the prepared remarks on the new product development and bringing down that installation cost and the labor cost of that installation. Can you just maybe get a little more granular on kind of (53:47) kind of what's the pipeline as to where, how much that could come down because obviously that's a very large factor in the decision process on buy or don't buy for those home standby products?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Charley, we think that it's probably somewhere in the area of a 5% reduction overall, it's really focused on the labor component by just reducing the overall cost to install, the time it takes to install. So 5% to 7% reduction in that, which again when you look at kind of the sensitivity analysis around a decrease in price there that should have a move up in volume. But that being said, as we've said repeatedly over the last several years, we do think it's going to take probably a more meaningful reduction in total cost of ownership. We've got some things that we continue to work on where we believe we can take a further step in that direction. We haven't really seen it show up yet in our proposals, obviously we're doing a lot of proposals, as I said before. So we haven't really seen it show up yet in proposals too dramatically because the product line simply just launched end of Q3, beginning of Q4. So, as proposals are put together, and as dealers get more experience installing the new version of the products, we think it will be – will improve that TCO push downward over the course of this year, but more to come on that. We've got a lot of work, we spend a lot of time on this internally, and we believe there are some things materially here in the future that could bring that down further.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, as we look at the implied 1Q impact from the promotional program successes in the fourth quarter, just wondering, if sell-through ultimately rules the volume demand over time, what's the net utility of the seasonal promotional programs?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: So the net utility of those promotional programs is really to make sure that there's field inventory for dealers, right. I mean if we were to keep all the field inventory here in our distribution centers and the ability to react to outage events as they occur becomes very constrained, very quickly. So we've always been keen to make sure that field inventory levels are healthy, that's an important element of reacting to demand. Demand happens quickly, it surges quickly, and it goes away quickly. So if levels are appropriate, we believe that that puts us in a position to win and not lose market share, should an event occur. So that's a big part of it. We also know frankly that having those products in front of those dealers for them to sell really gets them to focus on it. So if they don't have that unit in their shop, they are not looking at it. They are less focused and less likely to do the local advertising and the local marketing that we need for them to be successful and us ultimately be successful. So it's really kind of – it's a multipronged approach. And trust me, because we've questioned ourselves a numerous times on this, is there – are we leaving dollars on the table, where is that kind of balance in terms of how much promotion, there's too much promotion, what's not enough. And so, it's difficult to kind of walk that path, but we think we have the right approach. I will say the one change we're going to make going forward, last year we did our first kind of what I would say, we call it a pull promotion more at the consumer-oriented and level. So we did some extended warranties and things. Those were very well received, those were in the third quarter. We think that a better cadence of push and pull promotions, a better balance there is a way to kind of reduce our overall total costs while still creating the same level of engagement we need with distribution partners and ultimately changing the conversation a bit over at times of the year or two – a direct conversation with end consumers about having the product. So we continue to refine that, but that's really what the additional utility is all about with promotion.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then on the organic 1% to 3% for the year, how does that course respectively for the residential versus C&I?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Chris, this is York. So, on the resi side, I guess qualitatively we gave a guide that basically said we're assuming power outage severities similar to 2016 excluding this Matthew event. If you factor that as your overarching assumption on the residential side and then you factor in this destock in Q1 and then given the assumption of not having another Matthew happen in Q4, you'll have a tough comp in Q4. When you put that all together, resi is probably down slightly year-over-year from 2016 to 2017. Obviously, you get an event, any type of event and that will take that to positive growth year-over-year. On the C&I side, we're seeing solid growth in the core stationary business, be it domestically in Latin America or in Europe, but it's that mobile business that Aaron alluded to versus where we're seeing some strong trends. So we see on the mobile side both domestically and in Europe some strong growth year-over-year on the mobile side, but stationary, we are also seeing solid growth. So, I guess qualitatively that would be the direction we can give you on the resi versus C&I growth.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of John Quealy from Canaccord. Your line is now open.
John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, thanks, guys for squeezing me in. Good morning. Just one question.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Hey thanks John.
John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: So some of the newer or sort of refreshed opportunities combined heat and power, DR, peak-shave, talk about what you're going to do on the third-party side? I mean, are you going to talk to utilities or DR aggregators, maybe some E&C firms on the larger scale CHP, just talk a little bit about go-to-market? Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, John, good question. And so, as I said, I think we're in the early innings here on lining up the key initiatives around that, as we refer to it internally here we're calling it, lead gas. And so that lead gas initiative for us is going to get fleshed out here as we go forward. But clearly, from a go-to-market standpoint, it's not our traditional channels. I think that that's where probably the biggest amount of work has to happen. And frankly the products themselves require a bit of work, but not too dramatically, there are some different emissions levels, there is some different – some of the engines are a bit more heavy-duty, the alternators and other components may reflect a bit more heavy duty in nature to reflect the higher demand cycles for those products, but it's really the go-to market side of that, I think you've nailed it that is where our big – where really our heavy lifting has to be done. So, we'll be all the players and actors that you mentioned there are potential interfaces for us going forward. And that's going to require a different effort on our part. And as I said it's probably not going to look similar to what we do today. We've actually been down this path before, 15 years ago when distributor generation was going to be all the rage going forward when utility costs were going to up and gas prices were going to stay low, unfortunately gas prices went up and utility cost stayed low. So, it was the opposite effect and we ended up disbanding several sales initiatives and efforts that we had targeting distributor generation at that time. We had products in place and we had sales forces in place that we ended up ultimately moving away from and they were targeting utilities and other demand response aggregators, other places in the marketplace where you would expect to see that. So, more to come, early innings, but we think it presents really a whole new kind of area for us as we go forward here in 2017.
Operator: That now concludes our Q&A session. I will now like to turn the call back to Aaron Jagdfeld, President and CEO, for any further remarks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Great. Thanks. We like to thank everyone for joining us this morning and we look forward to our first quarter 2017 earnings release, which we anticipate will be sometime in late April. With that, we'll bid you adieu. Bye, bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Generac Holdings Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will have a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Mike Harris, the Vice President, Finance. Sir, you may begin.
Michael W. Harris - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and York Ragen, our Chief Financial Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Third quarter results exceeded our expectations in terms of net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Shipments of home standby generators were better than expected as they benefited from successful promotional programs. And portable generator sales were also higher than expected as a result of an increase in power outage activity during the third quarter. Importantly, power outages have moderately increased so far during the second half of the year relative to our previous assumptions. And we expect this to further benefit our business during the fourth quarter. The higher shipments of residential products during the third quarter helped to offset a weaker than expected performance of mobile products within domestic and international markets. During the third quarter, we also generated a strong level of operating and free cash flow, which enabled us to remain active with our share repurchase program. In fact, despite the headwinds experienced across several of our end markets, we have generated approximately $210 million of free cash flow over the last four quarters, which was a key factor in allowing us to complete our share repurchase program nearly a year ahead of schedule. On a year-over-year basis, net sales in the third quarter increased 4% to $373 million as compared to $359 million in the prior year, which includes a one-month benefit from the Country Home Products acquisition and a full three-month contribution from the Pramac acquisition. Although exceeding our expectations for the quarter, shipments of home standby generators declined modestly over the prior year as field inventory levels entering the current year third quarter were elevated when compared to last year and demand in the Northeast region remained soft on a year-over-year basis. Regarding power outages, since reporting second quarter results in early August, power outage activity has increased relative to the low levels experienced over the past several quarters. This has been primarily driven by a more active Atlantic hurricane season relative to recent years but also the result of a pickup in localized outage activity during the third quarter. Earlier this month, Hurricane Matthew impacted the Southeast region of the U.S. And although not making landfall anywhere along the Florida Coast, it still resulted in a large number of customers without power. While the duration of outages from Matthew wasn't to the magnitude of a major event, it did result in a large increase in portable demand. In addition, we believe Matthew should help to serve as an important awareness event and demand catalyst for home standby generators in the months ahead. As the company focused very heavily on backup power generation, our business model is built around providing a very high level of service and support during outages. I'm very proud of our teams at Generac as they stepped up their efforts by shipping product to the affected regions, assisting thousands of customers with their questions and providing technical support to our distribution partners. In addition, we're working on various activities to allow us to execute on the anticipated increase in demand for home standby generators in the Southeast, including ramping up our targeted marketing efforts and supporting our dealer base in that region as they focus on the resulting sales leads. As we have previously discussed, we remain focused on a number of strategic initiatives to increase the awareness, availability and affordability for home standby generators, including specific projects and activities targeted towards generating more sales leads, improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of these products. The improved power outage activity experienced thus far during the second half of 2016 should provide us a good opportunity to better leverage the innovative sales and marketing programs for home standby generators that we have implemented over the last several years. In addition, we believe we have enhanced our market position for our residential backup power products during the downturn as retail placement is currently at all-time highs and the number of active residential dealers has returned back to the peak levels experienced at the end of 2013. Looking at our Country Home Products acquisition, we continue to be encouraged by the overall performance of this business, including solid growth in sales and earnings and improved adjusted EBITDA margins compared to the prior year on a pro forma year-to-date basis. As we commented last quarter, the main drivers of the improvement are CHP's introduction of new value-oriented price points on several flagship models. The CHP acquisition annualized during the third quarter. And looking back over the last year, we've executed on a number of identified synergies and continued to pursue additional initiatives to capitalize on the combined strengths of the two companies. One area of our business that remains particularly challenging, however, is our domestic mobile product offering primarily serving the rental markets. While average energy prices have continued to improve over the past several months from the trough levels seen in mid-February, they remain below levels required for a meaningful recovery in oil and gas related capital equipment spending. As a result, this has had a significant impact on third quarter mobile product shipments to our broad base of rental customers in comparison to the prior year as they wait for a sustainable recovery in fleet utilization, rental rates and used equipment values. As discussed in recent quarters, we've taken a number of restructuring and cost reduction actions and continue to pursue other expense adjustments to better align our current cost structure with customer demand for mobile products. Now let me provide a few comments regarding the trends for our International segment. Recall that included in these results is the former Tower Light business which we acquired in August of 2013. Demand for mobile equipment in the market served by Tower Light continued to be soft during the third quarter and were below our expectations, primarily driven by the deferral of capital spending by several larger rental customers across the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. In addition, the weakness within the UK market is being magnified by the devaluation of the British pound against a basket of foreign currencies, which is further negatively impacting both sales and gross margins. As a result, we remain cautious regarding our views on rental fleet spending particularly in the UK markets. The International segment also includes the results from the Latin American region which experienced a modest year-over-year decline in sales during the third quarter. Although demand has been soft over the last several years in this area of the world as a result of volatile local currencies, lower energy prices and reduced infrastructure spending, the rate of decline continues to slow providing further support that end market demand may be stabilizing. Completing our discussion of the International segment is an update on the Pramac acquisition which closed on March 1 of this year. Similar to our recent CHP acquisition, we continue to be encouraged by the overall financial performance of Pramac which has also shown solid growth in sales and earnings and improved adjusted EBITDA margins compared to the prior year on a pro forma year-to-date basis. The integration of the Pramac business remains an important focus for 2016. And we have made good progress in evaluating and pursuing a variety of revenue and cost synergies. The acquisition of Pramac greatly expands our geographic footprint and revenue base, essentially doubling our international sales mix outside the U.S. and Canada and elevating us to a major player in the global power generation market. And lastly, as announced this morning, our board of directors has approved a new share repurchase program which authorizes the company to purchase up to an additional $250 million in common stock over the next two years. Given our ongoing strong free cash flow generation, we believe share repurchases represent an attractive use of capital at these valuation levels. Having an additional share buyback program in place will give us continued flexibility to deploy capital in the most beneficial way on behalf of our shareholders. I'd now like to turn the call over to York to discuss third quarter results in more detail. York.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the quarter were $373.1 million as compared to $359.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, including $60.8 million of contribution from the recent acquisitions of Country Home Products and Pramac. As a reminder, The Country Home Products acquisition closed on August 1, 2015. So results for the third quarter of 2016 include one month of contribution before becoming annualized and the Pramac acquisition closed on March 1, 2016. Looking at consolidated net sales by product class. Residential product sales during the third quarter of 2016, which are predominantly sold through the Domestic segment, increased 4.3% to $192.9 million as compared to $185 million the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the contribution from the recent acquisitions of Country Home Products and Pramac partially offset by a decline in shipments of home standby generators. As Aaron mentioned, the year-over-year decline in home standby generators was modest. And shipments during the quarter came in ahead of our expectations benefiting from increased power outage activity coupled with successful promotional programs. The organic decline in home standby generators as compared to the prior year was impacted by excess field inventory levels entering the third quarter as well as ongoing headwinds in activation rates in the Northeast region. As we enter the fourth quarter, we believe field inventory levels for home standby generators are now better balanced when comparing to the prior year levels. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales for the third quarter of 2016 increased 1% to $149.7 million as compared to $148.2 million for the prior year period in 2015. The increase was due to the contribution from the recent Pramac acquisition, which was mostly offset by a significant reduction in shipments of mobile products, given continued softness in the domestic oil and gas market as well as declines within the European region primarily driven by a deferral in capital spending by key rental equipment customers. Net sales for the other products category were $30.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the $26.1 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of after-market parts sales from the recent Country Home Products and Pramac acquisition. Gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 36.9% compared to 36.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in gross margins was driven by a variety of factors including the ongoing favorable impact of lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar coupled with a favorable overall organic product mix primarily due to higher sales of home standby generators. These improvements were partially offset by the addition of Pramac sales as well as the lower margins for mobile products. Operating expenses for the quarter increased $19 million or 30.4% as compared to the third quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily driven by the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with the Country Home Products and Pramac acquisitions. Recall these acquisitions both carry a higher level of operating expense infrastructure. In CHP's case, it's to support its direct-to-consumer business model. And in Pramac's case, it's due to its global commercial presence selling into over 150 countries. An increase in amortization of intangibles of $3.2 million also contributed to the year-over-year increase, which includes a $1 million write-off related to a tradename as the result of a new product transition. Lastly, the higher operating expenses in the third quarter of 2016 are also due to increased promotional activities which helped drive higher than expected home standby shipments during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company as defined in our earnings release was $72.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $81.2 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin before deducting for non-controlling interest was 19.5% in the quarter as compared to 22.6% in the prior year. The decline in adjusted EBITDA margin was solely driven by the acquisitions of CHP and Pramac as organic EBITDA margins were consistent with prior year. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments. Domestic segment sales were $299.1 million as compared to $332.2 million in the prior year quarter. The vast majority of the decline was due to the ongoing significant declines in shipments of mobile products into oil and gas and general rental markets. In addition, as we've discussed, shipments of home standby generators declined modestly over the prior year, but it exceeded expectations. Partially offsetting these reductions was the contribution from the Country Home Products acquisition which annualized on August 1. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $69.3 million or 23.2% of net sales as compared to $77.1 million in the prior year, also 23.2% of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the current year benefited from overall favorable product mix as well as lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar. This was offset by increased promotional activities and reduced overall leverage of fixed operating expenses. International segment sales primarily consisting of C&I products increased to $74 million as compared to $27.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase is primarily due to the contribution from the Pramac acquisition, partially offset by declines in organic shipments of mobile products into the European region. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment before deducting for non-controlling interest declined to $3.5 million or 4.8% of net sales as compared to $4.1 million or 15% of net sales in the prior year. The decline in International adjusted EBITDA margin as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with the Pramac acquisition, unfavorable product and geographic sales mix, foreign currency impacts and reduced operating leverage on lower organic sales volumes. Now, switching back to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2016 on a consolidated basis. GAAP net income attributable to the company for the quarter was $26.2 million as compared to $34 million for the third quarter of 2015. Included in the prior year other (expense) income section is a $2.4 million loss on changing contractual interest rate as a result of an increase in our term loan interest rate spread of 25 basis points for an anticipated period of four quarters. Included in the current year other (expense) income section is an additional $3 million loss on a changing contractual interest rate as a result of a continuation of the 25-basis-point spread increase for an anticipated period of five additional quarters. GAAP income taxes during the third quarter of 2016 were $15.5 million or a 37.5% tax rate as compared to $19.2 million or a 36.1% tax rate for the prior year. The increase in GAAP tax rate is due to a non-recurring discrete tax item impacting the current year quarter. Adjusted net income attributable to the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $53.2 million in the current year quarter versus $63.4 million in the prior year. Diluted net income per share attributable to the company on a GAAP basis was $0.40 in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $0.49 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted net income per share attributable to the company, as reconciled in our earnings release, was $0.82 for the current year quarter compared to $0.92 in the prior year. With regards to cash income taxes, the third quarter of 2016 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $2.3 million as compared to $0.5 million in the prior year quarter. The prior year reflected a cash tax rate of only 1% for the quarter due to a year-to-date true-up adjustment to revise cash taxes downward based on the latest projections at that time. The current year cash taxes reflect a cash tax rate of approximately 6%. As a reminder, our favorable tax shield for annual intangible amortization in our tax return results in our expected cash income tax rate being significantly lower than our currently projected GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% for 2016. As we drive profitability over time, cash income taxes can be estimated by applying a projected longer-term GAAP income tax rate of 36% on pre-tax profits going forward and then deducting the approximately $50 million of annual cash tax savings from the tax shield each year through 2021. Cash flow from operations was $48.3 million as compared to $35.3 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow, as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules, was $41.4 million as compared to $29.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. The improved cash flow versus prior year is primarily driven by a reduction in working capital investment during the current year quarter as compared to the larger investment in the prior year. This improved use of cash for working capital was partially offset by an overall decline in operating earnings. As of September 30, 2016, we had a total of $1.09 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs and $54.2 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $1.03 billion. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 3.9 times on an as-reported basis. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, there was approximately $145 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. The company repurchased 1.8 million shares of its common stock during the quarter for $65.4 million, which completes the total authorized amount under the share repurchase program which was announced in August of 2015. Under the program, a total of 6 million shares of common stock were repurchased for $200 million or approximately $33 per share. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide additional comments on our updated outlook for 2016.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, York. We are revising upward our prior guidance for revenue growth for the full year 2016, which is primarily due to an increased outlook for portable and home standby generators as a result of the higher power outage activity being experienced during the second half of 2016 as previously discussed. Net sales are now expected to increase between 9% to 10% over the prior year, which is an improvement from the 6% to 8% growth previously expected. Total organic sales on a constant currency basis are now anticipated to be down between 8% to 9%, which is an improvement from the previous assumption of down between 10% and 13%. Looking at our guidance by product class on a consolidated basis. For residential products, we now expect net sales to increase in the low to mid teens range during 2016, which assumes an organic increase in sales in the flat to low single-digit range. This compares to the previous expectations for net sales to increase in the mid to high single-digit range and organic sales to decline in the low to mid single-digit range. As discussed, the increase in organic net sales for residential products is primarily due to a large increase in demand for portable generators in response to Hurricane Matthew along with an improved outlook for home standby generators benefiting from the more favorable outage activity thus far during the second half of 2016, along with the success of our promotional programs. With regards to our commercial and industrial products, we now expect net sales to increase in the low single-digit range, a slight reduction from the previous expectation of a low to mid single-digit increase due to the lower shipments of mobile products. Organic net sales for C&I are now expected to decline in the low to mid 20% range, which is a slight decline from the previous guidance of low 20% range. Our expectations for gross margins, operating expenses as a percentage of sales and adjusted EBITDA margins remain the same as prior guidance. As a reminder, gross margins are expected to improve approximately 100 basis points to 125 basis points over the prior year when excluding the $6.1 million of non-recurring expenses recorded during the first half. Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales excluding amortization of intangibles and the $4.4 million non-recurring restructuring charge reported in the first quarter, are still expected to increase approximately 225 basis points to 250 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interest are still expected to be approximately 19.5% for the full year 2016. Importantly, recall that we have a majority ownership position in Pramac and there is a minority non-controlling interest with this acquisition that must be deducted when forecasting adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS for the full year 2016 similar to the presentation reflected in the reconciliation schedules included with our earnings release today. Operating and free cash flow are still expected to increase significantly over the prior year, benefiting from the strong conversion of adjusted net income. As a result of our upward guidance revision for sales and adjusted EBITDA dollars for 2016, we now expect to generate approximately $200 million of free cash flow for the full year. Regarding the outlook for our reporting segments, we expect net sales during 2016 for the Domestic segment to decline approximately 2.5% from the prior year base sales of $1.2 billion with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to be approximately 22.4%. For the International segment, net sales are expected to increase to approximately $275 million primarily as a result of the Pramac acquisition with adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 7% before deducting for the non-controlling interest. Lastly, regarding our outlook commentary, we're providing an updated summary of some guidance details to help model the company's earnings per share and cash flows for full year 2016. As a result of the increase in earnings outlook specifically for the fourth quarter 2016, the cash tax rate for the fourth quarter is anticipated to be approximately 11%, which results in cash taxes for the full year 2016 to be approximately $13 million to $13.5 million and the full-year tax rate of approximately 8.5%. We now expect interest expense to be in the range of $45 million to $45.5 million. The forecast for interest expense includes $41 million to $41.5 million of cash outflow for debt service costs plus approximately $4 million for deferred financing costs and original issue discount amortization for our credit facility. Depreciation expense is still expected to be between $21 million and $21.5 million. GAAP intangible amortization expense is now expected to be between $33.5 million and $34 million. Stock compensation expense is still expected to be approximately $10 million to $10.5 million and capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be approximately $32 million. In closing this morning, the moderate improvement in power outage activity experienced during the second half of 2016 should serve as an important reminder of the need for backup power and act as a catalyst for increased demand for our residential products. In addition, we'll continue to make strategic investments in new products, technologies and infrastructure across the business to support the next leg of growth that we believe will occur as more of our end markets improve. We remain optimistic regarding the long-term secular growth opportunities that exist for several areas of our business. And we intend to leverage our strong liquidity position as we evaluate our priority uses of capital to increase shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. So good color on the additional power outage activity. Can you just talk about, Aaron, maybe what you think are the one or two biggest things that you've changed in your approach or tools that are going to favorably impact kind of the reaction from these outages and maybe some of the early feedback you've gotten from those initiatives?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Sure, Jeff. I think for us, one of the interesting things is a lot of the tools that we put in the hands of distribution and frankly in our own hands are relatively new since the last kind of increase in outages occurred back in the kind of 2011-2012 type of period. So as an example, our PowerPlay iPad-based selling solution which is a – it's basically a sales system which has given us tremendous visibility into the markets and has really helped us understand the performance dealer to dealer, market to market, and what's going on in terms of close rates, in terms of activity, in terms of quoting, all things that we never really had visibility to before, the differences in installation costs, all those additional pieces of information have been great for us to kind of really focus on tightening up. I think one of the unknowns for us is really how does that lead system is which is really what it is, how does that perform in a period of increased outage activity. So one of the things that is very evident to us is this area of the country where the most recent outages took place, so kind of the eastern coast of Florida all the way up through the Carolinas, is an area that hasn't had a lot of outage activity in a number of years, and no, we're not going back just to 2011-2012. Really Florida, 10 years; the Carolinas, a little bit longer in some parts. So that's an area where you might argue that distribution has been a bit atrophied just in terms of engagement. And we actually have quite a few dealers in the affected area, over 400 dealers in that area. But in terms of alignment and in terms of just some of the program elements that we've offered over the years, we see probably a little bit lower engagement level in those areas because of the muted power outage environment. So as we ramp up, what we have to be mindful of is that we're going to need to help these dealers kind of walk before they run. They need to take some of these solutions like PowerPlay and we're going to have to do some additional training. We're going to have to get in the market and help them accelerate their use of some of these tools because they haven't been as advanced using them as maybe, say, some of the areas of the country like the Midwest or the Northeast. So that's kind of my commentary and that early returns from these markets have been as you would expect. With portable generators, very good, initially. We've got great distribution from a retail footprint standpoint in that area of the country. That's an area that hasn't atrophied. As we mentioned on our prepared remarks, kind of at all-time highs in terms of our retail placement. And we really saw that play out with the ability to deliver a lot of portable generators in that region of the country. And that's a key underpinning in why we raised our guidance for Q4. Alongside of that, as we've said, we do think these tools that we've got are going to lead to an increase in the home standby activity. And as evidenced, some of the leading indicators that we'll watch would be things like our in-home consultations. And we've seen in-home consultations, in particular, of that region have really picked up nicely as we would expect. And so we expect as we get in and start training and we've got a team that we've deployed from the factory here that will actually hit the ground next week in the Carolinas and in Florida to actually expand on the use of these tools; we expect that in-home consultations should increase even more. One last thing I'll add to that, Jeff, and I know it's a longwinded answer, but I think there's a lot of things going on here. Our targeted marketing efforts, we've got some pretty good views on what's going on market to market and where these outages happened. And so we're now in the final stages of completing our media plan to go after those markets in a very large way to target those regions to really fill the top of the funnel with leads. So a lot of activity going on as you would expect. We want to make sure we can capitalize on the increased awareness around the product categories. And we expect that that will play out here over the next several quarters.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just a quick – that's helpful. Just a quick follow-on on – so you took your revenue guidance up, you left the margins unchanged. Can you just speak to – I thought there'd maybe a little bit more leverage there. Maybe speak to what might be holding that back.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Jeff, this is York. So we have a longwinded answer for this one as well. So as you'd imagine, so we raised our residential guidance, brought down our mobile products guidance down a little bit. Overall, though that would generally imply a more favorable overall sales mix with that higher residential sales. You'd also get favorable overall SG&A leverage on those higher residential sales. But partly dampening that is just the fact that bringing our mobile guidance down a bit, we're also – not only top line but also the margin. So we're just seeing relative to previous expectation that those mobile product margins down overall. We did talk about promotional activities and whatnot here in the third quarter. So that – when you factor that into the full-year guide, that is something that's sort of offsetting some of those favorable impacts. And then just the fourth quarter with the updated guidance. You're going to have some additional employee incentive comp accrual. So when you put that all together, that allows us to hold the 19.5% EBITDA guidance for the year.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Mike.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird: So just on the C&I piece, any signs of stability at the bottom there for some of those affected markets?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I think domestically, Mike, we're starting to obviously – we'll get around the horn here in terms of getting into easier comps in that business. But that would be probably – the only sign of stability is just the fact that the numbers get quite a bit smaller in terms of comparatives going forward from a demand – just a pure market demand standpoint, we saw some normal seasonality kind of manifest itself in Q3 in terms of lighting towers, which is typically when we'd see that. The heating season, we've seen better interest in heat this year versus last year, of course. But we're coming off of a warm winter. And to be very frank, that business has been – that product line has been disappointing since we acquired it. It's just the timing of our acquisition was challenging. And that's really what the difficult comp in Q3 was all about, this time around was heat. We delivered a significant amount of heat last year in the third quarter and that didn't repeat this year. So as we get into the fourth quarter, we still have some headwinds that the way our guidance plays out, that we'll have to fight through. But as we get into 2017, we think that that'll abate certainly. But I think the key measurements and the key KPIs that we keep watching there are around rental rates, fleet utilization and then secondary market equipment pricing. All of those metrics are moving, I think, in a favorable direction. But without a meaningful recovery at least in energy prices, it's kind of a wait-and-see game. And you got to wait for these fleets to age. And until they age, it's – the fleet refresh cycle, that replacement cycle is just going to be deferred. And we're seeing – I think at one point, we were hopeful that might happen more likely in the back half of 2017. Frankly, that may play out to be more of a 2018 story depending on where energy prices go here. But we just don't see anything in the short term that gives us a tremendous amount of confidence in any major change there.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird: Yeah, okay, that's fair. And then back on the activity you've seen over the last couple of months here. Could you try to frame that a little bit from a historical perspective? Obviously, with the new tools you're implementing, that's going to be skewed more favorably for you. But what kind of pull-through do you typically get from this type of outage activity, what kind of tail is it? And at what point do you have a little better sense for how much pull-through you start getting on the standby side?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: So what we've said in the past and what we've experienced in the past – and again, the category is only about 15 years old with standby. So there's been a couple of notable points of over-indexed activity and under-indexed activity. So I'll speak to those. But I think our typical response has been – we'd see two to four quarters of follow-on demand in general on an average basis in the home standby category following an elevated period of outages. That was, of course, exacerbated after Sandy. That was really pushed to something more like six quarters to eight quarters. It really was a very strong follow-on. I think a lot of that, Mike, is the fact that when you kind of peel back the onion on an event like Sandy, that region had been impacted serially by a number of events in a short period of time. So there was a strange – you had Hurricane Irene and then you had a Snowtober event which was the snow on the leaves that caused trees to drop and take out power and then you had Sandy. And you had kind of those three things happen in rapid succession over the period of about kind of a year and a half. And this event, Matthew, in the Southeast is kind of a one-time deal in 10 years' time. So I think it would probably fall more along the lines of our two to four quarter statement. Just putting it in context, when you compare it to those other events that I just mentioned; in terms of our – kind of the way we look at power outages, right, and we've talked about this proprietary severity index which is a – it's really a mathematical formula of not only the number of people impacted by an outage but the amount of time, the duration of their outage, which we think is an important driver of demand. And so when you look at that kind of amalgamation, that severity index; this event would not rise to any of the last three events that I just mentioned. So it's still below that. And that's why in our estimation, it's really not a major event. It will drive increased awareness and it's certainly helpful in an area of the country where we haven't seen a lot of outages for a longer period of time. And there were millions of people that were without power. So that is certainly going to help us. And as we mentioned, I think the first wave here was portable gens as we've called out. But I think two to four quarters is probably the safe bet. And we'll get better visibility on that as the fourth quarter plays out here in terms of some of our efforts, shorter term and kind of how the distribution kind of is accepting of those efforts, and of course how the end market is accepting of the product category as the kind of fourth quarter plays out.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning and thank you for taking my call. Just a quick question for you on the number of dealers kind of in the impacted area. It didn't sound like many of them had been using your PowerPlay tools. Is that correct? And how quickly would it be to get them ramped up with that to take advantage of the storm?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Stanley, that's exactly what my comments were about. We have a good dealer base there. But it's not as what we would refer to as engaged as maybe some other parts of the country, that engagement level as measured by usage of those tools like PowerPlay. So it is a small percentage that are on the PowerPlay system in that region. And so in response to your question, how quickly can we get them to engage and get them signed up on the system; it's a very easy process. It's as easy as them getting an iPad and buying a license for the software. And that's something that can be done in very short order. And that actually is the number one priority of the team. We're deploying a field team. As I mentioned, that team will hit the ground next week in fairly large numbers to engage those 400 dealers in getting them signed up for PowerPlay. Remember that what's really important for those dealers, the messaging there is all of the activity we do in terms of marketing – so the infomercial and all the other lead generation activities that we do; all drive consumers, homeowners to our lead team internally here and that lead team qualifies those leads and then schedules those leads by pushing them out to dealers that are on PowerPlay. So if you're not on PowerPlay as a dealer, you're not going to get those leads. So the alignment that is required there is really important for those dealers to get those leads. So the messaging is a pretty simple one. If you want to see the leads – we're going to spend a lot of money in that area to work on awareness and of the category and through our marketing efforts. And if you want to get the leads in your hands, you've got to be on PowerPlay. So it's a pretty simple message. What we'll do is we're actually going to do a lot of what we refer to as ride-alongs. So we're going to go out with dealers and actually do a lot of handholding to do those first kind of initial kind of couple of IHCs with the system so that they get a feel for it. And then we'll turn it over to them and we'll be onto the next dealer. So we think over the next 60 days, we're going to be able to get a much higher adoption level of PowerPlay in that region of the country.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. And thankfully, the election is going to be over here in a couple of weeks. But does that impact your ability to -
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Thankfully.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Does that impact your ability to get favorable advertising rates in some of these markets which are going to be contested states? And how do we think about that? Does it delay the ability to get down and get the message out right on the heels of the storm or does it have to have a little bit of a lull period? How do we think about all that?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, advertising rates are a little bit more elevated at this time of year in an election cycle than you would see without that, of course. But I think the timing of this, maybe it pushes it a week or so. Really, the event just happened a couple of weeks ago. You have to wait for the power to come back on. We've got to get the dealers engaged and then we've got to get our media plan put together. We've actually started playing some media in that region already. But we'll double-down on that effort after the election passes. We also don't want to get caught up in the noise. Not only the just elevated pricing for the media cost today, but we don't want to get caught up in kind of the noise. People are – I know in our household, anytime there is an election ad that comes on; we're turning the channel. So I don't know. At some point, people are going to get the hint. But it's one of those things that it's just – we'll have to deal with it. It may push this out a week or so. But I don't think it's going to have a material impact on kind of the cadence that we would normally have around post-outage.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. I was wondering if you could go through some of the organic revenue growth figures for the quarter. I don't know if you'd be able to give us. For resi, it is up 4% in total and C&I up 1%. But if you give us organic numbers there and then maybe even organic on Domestic and International.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yes, Brian. It's York. So on the residential side, organically, that's only down slightly. It's a modest decline organically on the residential side. So they did get some contribution from one month of CHP that didn't get annualized. And then Pramac, if you recall, does sell portable generators which we classify a certain amount, not a lot, but a certain amount goes to that residential bucket. So organically, residential's down, call it modestly, organically. And then on C&Is, given that oil and gas decline; they're down about mid-20% range. So that's still weighing on the year-over-year growth rates. And I think Aaron mentioned it earlier in a commentary as we sold a lot of heat in the prior year. And that didn't necessarily repeat given the underutilization of that equipment on the field.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then I guess that's then Domestic versus International.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think the key there is – Domestic is where all the residential is. And International is primarily all C&I. And most of that growth year-over-year there, Brian, for International is in fact the Pramac acquisition growth. There is a certain amount, small amount that mobile products year-over-year declines in the European region. So there is some decline there. But the vast majority of that increase in International is going to be acquisition growth.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Can you just remind me how much of the Domestic segment actually is C&I?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: I guess we haven't broken that out.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: I guess you've got the slice by Domestic and International. And then you got the slice by product class. We haven't necessarily...
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: ...provided the matrix on that.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then I was wondering if you could, given the renewal of the share repurchase authorization, just a quick update on capital allocation plan. It's been about a year and a half since the Analyst Day. And is there any change to the amounts that you're expecting for share repurchase versus acquisitions and debt paydown, et cetera?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Brian, it's York again. So I guess the discussion of uses of cash and priority capital allocations is really a very – that discussion hasn't changed really since we've gone public. And we've got our stated priorities in terms of how we want to allocate capital. And debt paydown is something that we look at. We have a targeted leverage range of 2 times to 3 times. We're elevated now at 3.9 times. But we know, given where EBITDA has troughed here, we believe that that can return pretty quickly here as end markets recover. So not concerned about that leverage being that elevated. We are cognizant of that leverage and we don't want that to get too much higher. But we believe that that leverage ratio will moderate here as end markets return and get back to that 2 times to 3 times. So then you've got an M&A pipeline. We've demonstrated that we can execute on that M&A pipeline. We still are integrating Pramac here, so we want to be measured there. So then after that pipeline is return of capital to shareholders. And as we've demonstrated that share buybacks at these levels are an attractive use of that cash. And I think that we'll be opportunistic when we execute on that.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: And Brian, it gives us the opportunity to be – it gives us an added flexibility to evaluate a wider range of options then when we do have excess capital, as York said, after stepping through the priorities here. And as we mentioned, EBITDA – this would be our trough quarter on EBITDA given our guidance here. So we're optimistic we'll begin to delever that, if nothing more, then through improvements in the EBITDA run rate on an LTM basis. So that doesn't worry us where we're at from a leverage standpoint. But again, the buyback is really just another tool for us.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And we do have excess cash flow sweeps that are built into our term loans. So we have to be cognizant of that in our uses of cash as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jerry.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Aaron, are you willing to share the numbers with us on how much the in-home consultations are up through October just to help us understand the cadence of how the next couple of quarters might look and just to put the storm impact in context versus the company as a whole?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. We won't give specific percentages, Jerry. But what I can tell you is just kind of from a just data standpoint – we track this. Obviously, it's an important leading indicator and we've been tracking it over the last three years. And typically, what you'll see is there is a seasonality to this. In years where we haven't had major events in the fall, we actually do still see a nice improvement or have seen in the last few years where we got PowerPlay in place. We've seen a nice improvement in IHCs kind of in the back half of the third quarter as we enter the fourth quarter. And that's – I think the result has been you've seen improvement in our home standby run rates in Q4. Really, and that's the result of the Northeast still kind of coming off of those events, those serial events that happened. As we've called out, the Northeast has actually been pretty soft this year in terms of activation. And so we weren't necessarily seeing that same seasonality play out with IHCs. It was lower, as you would expect, as activations were lower there as well. What we have seen is that's now turned around. We've seen the IHCs pick up materially here again. It's just later than we would have seen it in maybe the last couple of years. And that really is a result of – based on regionally where we're looking at the IHCs, it's really a result of these outage events and the increased awareness. Oddly enough, we actually have seen the Northeast respond as well. So what we oftentimes see is there is a spillover effect. When you get a major event in whatever part of the country you get; the last area that was affected previously, in this case, the Northeast, there is an increase in interest. It becomes topical for people. And so we're going to make sure that we try to capitalize on that as well, that increased awareness there, by shifting some of the media spend into that market where otherwise, we may have otherwise started to curtail that. We're actually going to shovel some dollars into that region because we have seen a pickup in IHCs in that area. So again, I'm not giving you like discreet numbers. But I think just the timing of when we would see IHCs ramp and the nice increase that we have seen is very encouraging for us as a leading indicator to support the fourth quarter guidance that we've given. And again, we're in the middle of the budgetary process for 2017 here and we'll evaluate its impact overall as we kind of work through that process.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you for the context. And then for Pramac, you spoke about the impact of the weak pound on Tower Light. Has that had any impact on Pramac as a whole? And do you expect to recover the lost pricing as a result of the currency move in your businesses or is there is a local competition in the UK that would make that challenging?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, so the first part of the question. Pramac doesn't have much of a UK presence, just a little bit. It's actually smaller than Tower Light's UK business. So in terms of the currency impact, they're not as material or on a – it's material to Tower Light's business as a business, but it's not incredibly material to our results overall, I guess, would be a way to put it. And certainly with Pramac, it's even smaller because they don't have as big of a footprint there. Unfortunately, we don't believe there's going to be a great opportunity to recover the pricing. These are large national rental customers. Some of those prices are contracted. There is some wiggle room to move pricing. Thankfully, there aren't a large number of local manufacturers in the UK. But that notwithstanding, it is still a competitive environment and we have to respond to that as such. So unfortunately, we don't think – we certainly aren't going to recover all of that in pricing. There may be a little bit of that. Where we're really going to get the opportunity to try and work on improving margins in the UK is through consolidation of operations. We have an operation in the UK for Pramac and we have an operation in the UK for Tower Light. We're currently in the investigative stage of consolidation of those operating footprints so that we can try and reduce our overall cost structure in the UK. But again, I think our bigger issue, our bigger challenge is really on the pricing side and that probably is not something that we see resolving itself very easily.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: And it's reflected in our guidance.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: And it's reflected in our guidance appropriately in that fashion.
Operator: And our next question is from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hello, good morning. Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Ross.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, I just wanted to ask you about telecom, like how that's trending like up or down year-on-year. I don't think you mentioned it in your formal remarks. And how do you think this AT&T-Time Warner thing impacts that business. I know like over the last couple of years when the DirecTV acquisition was pending, it seemed like you felt that that had a softening impact on the market. And I'm wondering if that – obviously, this is going to be a long drawn out process, but if that weighs on capital spending in that market?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I think, obviously, it's a great question, Ross. And we watch that market very closely. It's been an important market overall for us as a vertical in C&I. And we've been a longstanding supplier to that market. We had more encouraging conversations earlier in the year. But those conversations – I think as M&A activity for many of our major channel partners there has increased with Verizon, it's Yahoo; with AT&T, it's been DirecTV and now the Time Warner deal. And just historically for us, anytime we see those channel partners use their capital for M&A; it tends to come – at least in our markets, it tends to manifest itself in kind of muted demand for telecom. And that is really what we've reflected in our guidance here. We really haven't reflected any material uptick in it. We were kind of already seeing that. And I think the AT&T announcement with Time Warner only kind of doubles-down on that. I think what is a little more interesting to me is just maybe the signal all of those deals are sending in terms of just the network infrastructure spend by any of the wireless companies. I just find it interesting that since the net neutrality rules have come into play here, that – I guess is there a broader macro theme here of deemphasizing the investment in the networks and the investment in hard assets as I guess in reality, you're basically building a highway for somebody else to drive a car on. And does that give their shareholders the best return? I thought it was interesting Google Fiber kind of made their announcement yesterday or this morning kind of pulling back. And I think they found it a lot more costly to go into the markets and to do what they wanted to do. But is that also somewhat tied to net neutrality? They didn't call it that. But you just wonder where is the investment in hard assets for the pipe for all these things, whether it be wireless or whether it be fiber, where is that going longer term in terms of investment. So we'll continue to watch it. I think the good news is there is a lot of sites out there that still don't have backup power. So the opportunity set for us is pretty large. And power quality continues to degrade and that's something that we'll keep an eye on the market. But you do see some kind of signs on the horizon here with the M&A activity and some of the other kind of macro themes here. It makes one pause in terms of what that may mean for kind of capital spending by these types of customers today and into the near term.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks, Aaron. And then just lastly, I wanted to ask you about the big-box retailers. You mentioned that your product placements, I think, at all-time highs with the retailers. But just wondering how sell-through has been, retail sell-through, aside from like the increased power outage activity. It just seems like some of the vendors to the big-box retailers are reporting softer numbers over the last couple of days in different categories than yours. But have you seen that at all generally outside of the weather-impacted areas or has it just been pretty steady state?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. To be honest, we haven't really talked too much about sell-through. We see sell-through activity from our channel partners. And I can tell you there's nothing I've seen in the last several weeks – now I haven't looked at it in the last couple of days, which I think was your reference point. But in the last several weeks, the sell-through activity is as we would expect. In the regions that were impacted by the outages, that was elevated certainly during the outages and immediately thereafter. And we haven't seen anything there that would lead us to a different conclusion about kind of either our feelings about the impact. Remember, as important of a channel as retail is – and it is an important channel, great partners and we've had longstanding relationships there – our dealer channel is really the channel that, for home standby anyway, because this is a home improvement project. It's an installed product. It's a considered sale, highly considered sale, highly researched sale, a big ticket item. The dealer channel is the larger channel there and over the last decade has grown faster than retailers. The retailers still serve a really important part though of the awareness around these product categories. A lot of times people will see the product for the first time at a retail shelf. And they may start to get interested in the category through that interaction. So our point of purchase displays are really important. And obviously, the training and other things that we do with those retailers is really critical. But to be frank, the dealer channel – most people want a turnkey solution and some of our retailers are already paired up with our dealer channel. We have retail install programs that have been successful. In those programs, we've seen nice improvement of those numbers over the last several weeks as you would expect in the regions that were impacted. But we haven't seen anything – and I can't speak to anything in the last few days to be honest, Ross. But we'll continue to keep an eye on kind of sell-through and understand how that might impact the business going forward.
Operator: And your next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Chris.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. So on the comments about the modest increase in outages; obviously, the hurricane was in October. But is that a dynamic where there's no individual call-out, it's more of just a little bit of a wave through the various geographies?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And part of it – we've run some campaigns, some pretty effective promotional campaigns coupled with the outage events, in our estimation, have been very successful. And it's one of the reasons why the outperformance in Q3 certainly, as we kind of got to the back half of September, even before kind of Matthew. But we've seen an event like Matthew being an overall awareness event. We've also seen some localized outages up in the Northwest coming off of some of the storms that have been hitting the Northwest Territory here over the last couple of weeks. All of those things are driving to improve, I think, the overall IHC environment, the in-home consultation environment as we've called out. A lot of our leading indicators are pointing, what we believe, in a very good direction. And I'd also say inventory levels have played a part. We talked about field inventory. As we entered the third quarter, field inventory was a little bit elevated. And so there was a bit of a destocking that occurred during the third quarter. And in spite of that, we outperformed our expectations, a lot of that again the promotions coupled with kind of the elevated outage event. But as we entered the fourth quarter, we look at kind of inventory levels today in the field as being very much in line year-over-year. And I think that's an important point to make because we don't anticipate and our guidance doesn't contemplate any kind of restocking or destocking events that need to take place in any measurable way certainly in the fourth quarter. So I think that that is an important part of the guide as we go from Q3 to Q4.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then regarding the fourth quarter revenue lift and sort of allocating that; obviously, we could take the segment guidance and triangulate. But I just wanted to take a little different angle. The midpoint of your full-year guidance puts roughly a $40 million higher fourth quarter than the third. Just wanted to ask about the components of that. Is that pretty much all standby or is there some little bit of seasonality and C&I contributing to that?
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Going from Q3 to Q4 is the question, Chris? That's your question?
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, and the midpoint has it, call it, $40 million higher than the third quarter.
York A. Ragen - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's predominantly that resi volume and I think the outage activity, the concept that Aaron just talked about in terms of not having the field inventory, being more balanced coming into the Q4. So most of that $40 million that you're talking about is going to be on the resi side.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from John Quealy with Canaccord. Your line is open.
John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So big picture. I know I talked about this, I don't know, a while ago. Aaron, your thoughts on battery storage. Tesla not really doing much, as it seems, with Powerwall. LG Chem announced some stuff in the Gulf Coast. Talk about that and if cost still is an issue. But would you guys think about it if it got commercial traction and the economics were there? Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, John. And obviously, I think what's really important in battery storage – and you've seen I think the Tesla Powerwall. I think they pulled the product down that they had put out there as a backup solution. I think it's an interesting storage device for people who have alternative power sources at the home or business, solar being the primary there. Having an intermittent storage device to work on the rate arbitrages that exist during the middle of the day or the peak times during the day is important. But as a backup, as a purely backup solution, you don't know how long an outage is going to occur. And that's really what – our product is fundamentally different. We serve a different market there. And I think a couple of things would have to happen. Certainly, the economics of batteries would have to improve dramatically. But the amount of storage that you'd need – again, Hurricane Matthew is a great example. There were people down in Hurricane Matthew – in the impacted zones that were out of power for four days. There's no battery today on the market – you'd have to have a lot of batteries to get you past four days. So to spend that kind of money on a solution just doesn't make sense. So let's fast forward, John, and assume for a second that the economics become workable at some point in the future. If they did, I think what's really important – and I try to stress this with not only external constituents but internally here at the company. What we do with a home standby generator – I'd love to tell you that there's a ton of proprietary technology there. I think what we do on a scale basis is unique. And I think what we do in certain elements of the product is unique. But to be honest, the product itself, the technology itself, a reciprocating engine driving a set of copper windings has been around for a long, long time. It's kind of Physics 101. It's been around 80 years. And I think we've done some unique things with it. But I think what's really important is the system that we built to create awareness and the system we built to sell it and promote it and market it and install it and service it. That entire investment over the last 15 years, the network that we built, that 5,400 dealers we called out when we're back at our high point for distribution post-Sandy, which is amazing to me just sitting here that we've got that many engaged partners that are interested in the category in spite of being in kind of a down power outage environment. So what's inside the box, whether it's an internal combustion engine or whether it's a set of batteries; we can commercially go out and buy batteries on the open market. And if batteries tomorrow, if technology shifts and the economics make sense; that's what we would do. Again, there is really nothing proprietary there. But all the things we do around it, that's what's really valuable to us. And I think that's what's really hard to replicate when it comes to just the amount of time and the amount of money that we put into that.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions. So I'll now turn the call back over to Aaron Jagdfeld, President and CEO, for closing remarks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Generac Holdings, Inc.: Great. We want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings release which we anticipate will be sometime in mid-February of 2017. With that, we'll bid you a good day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Generac Holdings, Inc., Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will have a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today's conference, Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will begin today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. As announced in our earnings press release, this morning, we have changed our segment reporting structure, as a result of the recent Pramac acquisition in March of this year, which doubled our International sales mix and accelerated our strategic plan to expand our business internationally. Going forward, we'll present results under two new reporting segments, Domestic, which represents our businesses based in the U.S. and Canada, and International, which represents the Ottomotores, Tower Light and Pramac acquisitions. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our overall financial results for the second quarter as residential product sales, highlighted by our organic growth in home standby generators were up solidly over the prior year and were above our expectations due to the effectiveness of our pre-season promotional programs ahead of the important summer storm season. This performance helped to offset the continued weakness in demand for mobile products in the U.S. and Canada as a result of further reductions in oil and gas related capital spending along with lower than expected international shipments of mobile products, particularly in the United Kingdom. Overall growth in adjusted EBITDA margins were also in line with our expectations, helping to generate a strong level of operating and free cash flow during the quarter. In addition, we also resumed activity on our share repurchase program. On a year-over-year basis, net sales in the second quarter increased 27% to $367 million as compared to $288 million in the prior year, which includes the benefit of the Country Home Products acquisition, which closed in August of 2015, as well as the full three-month contribution from the Pramac acquisition that closed on March 1. Shipments of home standby generators during the current year quarter improved over the prior year as field inventory levels entering the current year second quarter were lower as compared to last year. This factor, along with the improved distribution sentiment led to the improved effectiveness of our normal pre-season sales, marketing and promotional programs ahead of the summer storm season. Regarding power outage severity, the second quarter of 2016 experienced lower outages than the second quarter last year, and are still well below the long-term average, with the baseline level of outages over the past year and a half remaining particularly low, contributing to an ongoing soft market for backup power. While penetration rates for home standby generators continue to increase, the growth rate for the category has been slowing due to an extended period of low power outages. With 2016 representing the fourth consecutive year, since the last major event along with a very low baseline level of outages experienced during 2015 as well as the first half of 2016. The Northeast has been the primary driver of this weakness, as demand in this important region continues to soften after experiencing peak levels during 2013, following the major power outage events that took place during 2011 and 2012. An encouraging sign of the categories continued growth potential is evident when looking at the regions outside of the Northeast. Activation rates outside the Northeast, during the first half of 2016, fared better showing solid growth in the aggregate over the prior year. While the power outage environment is obviously beyond our control, when market conditions inevitably improve, we believe we are very well positioned to fully leverage the innovative sales and marketing programs for home standby generators, which have only been implemented over the last several years. In addition, we believe we have enhanced our competitive position for our residential backup power products, during the downturn, as our market share and retail placement are currently at all-time highs and the number of active residential dealers is near the peak levels experienced at the end of 2013. We remain focused on a number of strategic initiatives to increase the awareness, availability, and affordability for home standby generators, including specific projects and activities targeted towards generating more sales leads, improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of these products. In particular, we have an important new product launch coming in the fourth quarter that is specifically aimed at reducing the installation cost of a home standby generator. This launch represents the comprehensive redesign of our flagship Guardian product line, and we estimate that the changes to the product will reduce the total time it takes to install a unit by up to 25%. As we continue to focus on innovative ways to tackle the challenge of making home standby generators more affordable, we believe that additional opportunities exist in the future to further improve the speed of installation and thereby reduce the total cost of ownership. One area of our business that remains particularly challenging is our domestic mobile products offering, primarily serving the rental markets. While average energy prices have improved in recent months from the trough levels seen in mid February, they continue to remain below levels required for a meaningful recovery in oil and gas related capital equipment spending. Accordingly, this has had a significant impact on mobile product shipments to specialty and general rental customers during the second quarter relative to the prior year, as these customers wait for fleet utilization, rental rates and used equipment values to recover. As a result of the significant downturn in capital spending for these products, we announced a number of restructuring actions on our last earnings call, that we made good progress on in the second quarter, including the consolidation of the Bismarck, North Dakota, facility into our Berlin, Wisconsin facility. In addition, we continue to pursue other facility footprint reductions and numerous operating expense adjustments to better align our current cost structure with current customer demand for mobile products. A few other comments on the remainder of our Domestic C&I products. Shipments to our telecom national account customers increased during the second quarter compared to the prior year. However, the overall soft capital spending environment that persisted in 2015 has continued thus far in 2016. As we enter the second half of the year, we're not seeing the increase in telecom related backup generator projects that we had originally expected due to the reprioritization of capital by our national account customers. We continue to believe that telecom is an important vertical longer term for backup generators, as this critical element of the nation's infrastructure remains particularly vulnerable to the effects of an aging and underinvested power grid. Shipments to our North American industrial distributors increased during the quarter, as we continued to see results from our multiyear effort to expand our industrial generator product line and improve our distribution through several key initiatives. However, in the second quarter, we began to see lower quotation levels, which we believe correspond with softening nonresidential construction bid spec market for generators as well as a weakening in overall business capital spending, which impacts the market for optional standby generators. Finishing up our comments on the Domestic segment, the second quarter was our first experience with the seasonally strong peak demand quarter for the Country Home Products business. Remember that, CHP is a leading manufacturer of professional-grade engine-powered equipment sold primarily under the DR brand and used in a wide variety of property maintenance tasks. Results for the quarter were strong, and we are encouraged by the overall financial performance of CHP including solid growth in sales and earnings, and improved adjusted EBITDA margins, compared to the prior year on a pro forma basis. The main drivers of the improvement are CHP's efforts to redesign certain products, allowing the company to offer new value-oriented price points on several flagship models. Thereby opening up additional channels for DR branded products for consumers who are more price sensitive. In addition, the company has been able to utilize its existing marketing capabilities for the new products, to better leverage its fixed operating expense infrastructure. We continue to make encouraging progress with the integration of CHP, as we're pursuing some exciting cross-selling opportunities for our combined product lines, along with leveraging CHP's direct-to-consumer expertise in helping us further refine our targeted marketing skills as we work to broaden the awareness and appeal of home standby generators. This acquisition has also provided additional scale to our existing offering of power equipment products, allowing us to target certain cost synergies, as we leverage our global sourcing and manufacturing capabilities. Now, let me provide a few comments regarding the trends for our new International segment. Included in these results is the former Tower Light business, which we acquired in August of 2013. Demand for mobile equipment in the markets served by Tower Light, particularly in the United Kingdom, which represents an important market for this business, softened significantly in the second quarter. The pullback in capital spending by several large rental customers in the UK can be attributed to Brexit-related uncertainty that has developed in recent months. As we begin the important fall season for mobile lighting equipment, we remain cautious regarding our views on rental fleet spending in the second half of the year, particularly in UK markets. Also included in the International segment are the results from the Latin American region, which experienced a year-over-year decline in sales during the second quarter. This region remains challenging as a result of volatile local currencies, lower energy prices and reduced infrastructure spending across a number of Latin American countries. Although demand has been soft over the last several years in this area of the world, the rate of decline has slowed, and a bottom for end market demand seems evident. While we remain optimistic about the longer term prospects for our business in Latin America, macroeconomic factors in the near-term will continue to make this a challenging region for backup power providers. Rounding out the International segment for the second quarter are our full three months of results from the Pramac acquisition, which closed on March 1. Pramac, headquartered in Siena, Italy, is a leading global manufacturer of stationary, mobile and portable generators sold in over 150 countries through a broad distribution network. Results for the second quarter were strong, with solid growth in sales and earnings and improved adjusted EBITDA margins compared to the prior year on a pro forma basis. The improved sales volumes led to higher absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs and improved leverage of operating expenses, and were the primary driver of the EBITDA margin improvements. It's relevant to note that a majority of Pramac sales are in the European region. However, the company has only minimal direct exposure to the United Kingdom. The integration of the Pramac business continues to be an important focus for us for 2016, and we have made encouraging progress in evaluating and pursuing a variety of revenue and cost synergies. Pramac provides significant diversification benefits to Generac, as the acquisition greatly expands our geographic footprint and revenue base, essentially doubling our International sales mix outside of the U.S. and Canada, and elevating us to a major player in the global power generation market. I'll now turn the call back over to York to discuss second quarter results in more detail. York?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the second quarter of 2016 were $367.4 million as compared to $288.4 million in the second quarter of 2015, including $88.1 million of contribution from the recent acquisitions of Country Home Products and Pramac. Looking at consolidated net sales by product class. Residential product sales during the second quarter of 2016, which are predominantly sold through the Domestic segment, increased 36.2% to $181.7 million as compared to $133.5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the contribution from the recent Country Home Products acquisition, along with an increase in shipments of home standby generators, and to a lesser extent portable generators. Given the second quarter represents CHP's peak demand season, this acquisition was a significant contributor to the year-over-year sales growth for residential products. The organic increase in home standby generators over the prior year, as Aaron mentioned, was impacted by improved pre-season buying activity in the current year against a relatively softer second quarter of 2015 comparison. As discussed, home standby sales in the prior year were negatively impacted by excess field inventory levels that existed at that time, which reduced the impact of our normal pre-season sales promotions ahead of the 2015 summer storm season. In contrast, during the current year quarter, there was improved sentiment from our distribution partners to invest in additional inventory levels, as a result of a more favorable field inventory situation entering the second quarter of 2016. Looking at our Commercial & Industrial products. Net sales for the second quarter of 2016 increased 16.5% to $156.7 million as compared to $134.6 million for the comparable period in 2015. The increase was due to a full three months of contribution from the recent Pramac acquisition, which closed on March 1, and to a lesser extent, increased domestic shipments of stationary generators through industrial distributors and telecom national account customers. These increases were partially offset by a significant reduction in shipments of mobile products, given continued softness in domestic oil and gas and general rental markets as well as Brexit-related uncertainty in the United Kingdom. Net sales for the other products category were $28.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $20.3 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of aftermarket parts sales from the recent Country Home Products and Pramac acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, the increase was also due to additional service parts sales resulting from our growing base of stationary and mobile products in the market. Gross profit margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 33.8% compared to 33.3% in the prior year quarter. The current year includes the impact of $3.4 million of additional cost of goods sold relating to the purchase accounting step-up in value of inventories relating to the Pramac acquisition. Excluding the impact of this adjustment, gross profit margin was 34.7%, an improvement of 140 basis points over the prior year. The increase in gross margins was driven by a variety of factors including the favorable impact of lower commodity costs, and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar in recent quarters, a favorable overall organic product mix, primarily due to a higher sales mix of residential products in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year; and the favorable impact of gross margin from the acquisition of Country Home Products. All these improvements were partially offset by the addition of Pramac sales mix. Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2016 increased $23.6 million as compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily driven by the additions of recurring operating expenses associated with the Country Home Products and Pramac acquisitions. As previously mentioned, the second quarter is the seasonally strong peak demand quarter for CHP's products and this acquisition carries a higher level of operating expenses, due to its direct-to-consumer business model. Also, the second quarter results include, for the first time, a full three months of contributions from the Pramac acquisition, which also carries a higher operating expense infrastructure to support its global presence, selling into over 150 countries. In addition, a $2.2 million increase in amortization of intangibles also contributed to the year-over-year increase in operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $62.3 million in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $52.4 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin before deducting for non-controlling interest was 17.4% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 18.2% in the prior year. The decline in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to prior year was primarily attributable to the increase in operating expenses driven by the acquisition mix, partially offset by the improvement in gross margins as the result of the factors just discussed. I will now briefly discuss financial results for our two new reporting segments. Domestic segment sales increased 11.1% to $286.7 million as compared to $258.1 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the contribution from the Country Home Products acquisition and to a lesser extent, an increase in shipments of home standby generators, partially offset by a significant reduction in shipments of mobile products into oil and gas and general rental markets. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased to $57.4 million, or 20% of net sales as compared to $48.5 million in the prior year, or 18.8% of net sales. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a favorable product mix as well as the favorable impact of lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar in recent quarters, partially offset by modestly higher organic operating expenses. International segment sales, which primarily consist of C&I products, increased to $80.7 million as compared to $30.2 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was due to the contribution from the Pramac acquisition, partially offset by declines in organic shipments into the UK, given Brexit uncertainty, and into Latin American markets given continued economic softness in that region. Adjusted EBITDA for the International segment, before deducting for non-controlling interest, increased to $6.6 million or 8.2% of net sales, as compared to $4 million or 13.1% of net sales in the prior year. The decline in adjusted EBITDA margin as compared to the prior year was primarily due to unfavorable product and customer mix, along with lower absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs and reduced leverage of operating expenses on the lower organic sales volumes. Now switching back to discussing more of our financial performance in the second quarter of 2016 on a consolidated basis. GAAP net income attributable to the company for the second quarter of 2016 was $20.9 million as compared to $14.8 million for the second quarter of 2015. The current year net income includes the $3.4 million pre-tax purchase accounting inventory step-up adjustment related to Pramac, as previously discussed. In addition, the prior year included a $3.4 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt that impacted prior year GAAP net income. GAAP income taxes during the second quarter of 2016 were $11.9 million, or a 36.3% tax rate, as compared to $8.6 million, or a 36.8% tax rate for the prior year. Adjusted net income attributable to the company, as defined in our earnings release, was $42.7 million in the current year quarter, versus $35.3 million in the prior year. The increase over the prior year is primarily the result of the previously discussed overall improvement in operating earnings as adjusted for the $1.5 million of minority non-controlling interest related to the Pramac acquisition. Diluted net income per share attributable to the company on a GAAP basis was $0.31 in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $0.21 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted net income per share attributable to the company, as reconciled in our earnings release, was $0.64 for the current year quarter, compared to $0.50 in the prior year. With regards to cash income taxes, the second quarter of 2016 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $1.5 million, as compared to $0.9 million in the prior year quarter. This year-over-year increase in cash income taxes for the quarter was primarily the result of higher pre-tax earnings in the current year quarter, as the cash tax rate of 5% was similar to the 6% rate in the prior year. As a reminder, our favorable tax yield through annual intangible amortization or tax return, results in our expected cash income tax rate, being significantly lower than our currently projected GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% for 2016. As we drive profitability over time, cash income taxes can be estimated by applying a projected longer term GAAP income tax rate of 36% on pre-tax profits going forward, and then deducting the approximately $50 million of annual cash tax savings from the tax yield, each year through 2021. Cash flow from operations was $59.1 million as compared to $16.3 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow as defined in the accompanying reconciliation schedules was $52.2 million as compared to $8.6 million in the second quarter of 2015. The increases in cash flow were primarily driven by a large reduction in working capital during the current year quarter, as compared to a large increase in working capital in the prior year, along with an overall improvement in operating earnings. As of June 30, 2016, we had a total of $1.08 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs, and $75.6 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $1.01 billion. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter 2016 was 3.7 times on an as-reported basis. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, there was approximately $142 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. The company repurchased 935,000 shares of its common stock during the second quarter of 2016, under its existing share repurchase program announced in August of 2015. Remember that this program provides the authorization to repurchase up to $200 million of common stock over a 24-month period, and to-date, a total of 4.2 million shares of common stock have been repurchased for an approximately $135 million. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our outlook for 2016.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Thanks, York. As a result of current end market conditions, we are revising our prior guidance this morning for full year 2016 revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margins. Entering the second half of the year, we've seen some additional weakening developed in several end markets, which is leading to a reduction in our full year outlook. This includes an ongoing very low power outage environment, continued weakness in oil and gas markets, lower capital spending by telecom national account customers, a softening nonresidential construction market for industrial generators and Brexit related economic concerns within Europe. Net sales for full year 2016, are now expected to increase between 6% to 8%, with total organic sales on a constant currency basis, now anticipated to decline between 10% and 13%. This revised top-line guidance continues to assume no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment, and also assumes the power outage severity during the second half is similar to the levels experienced during the first half of 2016, which remain at very low levels relative to the recent baseline average over the last several years. As a reminder, should the power outage environment normalize, or if there is a major event in 2016, it's likely we could exceed these expectations. Looking at our guidance by product class, on a consolidated basis, for residential products, we now expect net sales to increase in the mid-to-high single-digit range during 2016, which now assumes an organic decline in the low-to-mid single-digit range. The decline in organic net sales for residential products is due to a more conservative view of end market demand for standby generators, particularly regarding the outsized impact from greater declines than expected in activation rates within the Northeast region, as previously discussed. With regards to our Commercial & Industrial products, we now expect net sales to increase in the low-to-mid single-digit range. Organic net sales for C&I are now expected to decline in the low 20% range, primarily due to the reasons previously discussed. Regarding gross margins, excluding the $6.1 million of non-recurring expenses recorded during the first half, consisting of the $2.7 million first quarter restructuring charge and $3.4 million purchase accounting adjustment in the second quarter, gross margins are now expected to improve between 100 basis points to 125 basis points as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding amortization of intangibles and the $4.4 million non-recurring restructuring charge recorded in the first quarter are now expected to increase between 225 basis points and 250 basis points as compared to 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interest are now expected to be approximately 19.5% for the full year of 2016. Similar to the pattern experienced in the prior year, second half 2016 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be notably higher than the first half. The improvement in second half margins is still expected to be as a result of increasing benefit from product cost reductions, a more favorable product mix, and improving SG&A leverage on higher sales volumes through the back half of the year. Specifically for the third quarter, we anticipate net sales to be approximately flat as compared to the prior year on an as reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the third quarter are expected to improve approximately 250 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2016 and then further improve sequentially during the fourth quarter. As an important reminder, we have a majority ownership position in Pramac and there will continue to be a minority non-controlling interest with this acquisition that must be deducted, when forecasting adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS for the full year 2016, similar to the presentation reflected in the reconciliation schedules, included with our earnings release this morning. Despite our reduction in guidance for sales growth and adjusted EBITDA margins, we still expect to generate over $100 million of free cash flow in the second half of the year. Regarding the outlook for our new reporting segments, we expect net sales during 2016 for the Domestic segment, to decline between 6% to 7% from the prior year base sales of $1.2 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to be approximately 22.5%. For the International segment, net sales are expected to increase to approximately $280 million, primarily as a result of the Pramac acquisition, with adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 8% before deducting for the non-controlling interest. Lastly, regarding our outlook commentary, we are providing a summary of some guidance details, to help model the company's earnings per share and cash flows for full year 2016. We now expect interest expense to be in the range of $45.5 million to $46 million. The forecast for interest expense includes $41.5 million to $42 million of cash outflow for debt service cost, plus approximately $4 million for deferred financing costs and original issue discount amortization for our credit facility. Cash taxes are now expected (27:00) to be approximately $7.5 million to $8 million which translates into an anticipated full year 2016 cash income tax rate of approximately 5%. Depreciation expense is still expected to be between $21 million and $21.5 million. GAAP intangible amortization expense is now expected to be between $31.5 million and $32 million. Stock compensation expense is now expected to be appropriately $10 million to $10.5 million and capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be approximately $33 million to $34 million, which is still only about 2.5% of our forecasted net sales for the year. In closing this morning, while our revised outlook for the remainder of the year reflects further softening across several of our end markets, we remain focused on controlling costs as we continue to make strategic investments in new products and technologies. We also continue to invest in the necessary infrastructure to support the next leg of growth that we believe will occur in the future as markets improve. As we navigate through the challenging macro demand environment in the near-term, we are focused on several important strategic initiatives to drive our Powering Ahead plan forward while remaining optimistic regarding several long-term growth opportunities that exist for our business. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Jeff. Good morning.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Hi, Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So it sounds like most of the changes to your guidance are commercial related, because it just seems like home standby did reasonably well, and I think you've been planning for kind of low storms. I mean is that fair, are you seeing some incremental softening in quoting activity on the home standby side?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. I mean, Jeff, it's – we think of our guidance change this morning primarily in that context around just end markets that have softened up a bit more, oil and gas has been a very challenging area for us, impacting mobile products. We've called that out over the last four quarters or five quarters, maybe six quarters now. And unfortunately, we just don't see, I think there was a bit of optimism in the back half of this year, at least, around some seasonality that would occur. And I think that, as we look, we step back and in particular with the most recent pull back in oil prices here, we just don't feel like it's prudent to think about a recovery there, even on a seasonal basis in the back half, so that's disappointing. You're throwing that on top of that with our European exposure now in particular in the UK, and it really is primarily the Tower Light business, the former Tower Light business and mobile products there. We've seen CapEx essentially dry up very quickly in the second quarter in the UK, where the rental market is really the most well defined in Europe. There is a larger rental customers there, and unfortunately with all of the discussions around Brexit, and some of the other macroeconomic issues in Europe that slowed down dramatically. And we've got, again that business is seasonal as well, when the days get shorter, lighting equipment generally tends to become in higher demand, but again I think we're taking an approach here that, because of the uncertainty around Brexit, we felt that reducing the outlook there was really the better call. Telecom spending, it was interesting in the first half of the year. I think we felt better about telecom, in fact, our results in the first quarter outperformed our expectations, in the second quarter, we were in line, which was a beat year-over-year. But unfortunately, as we got to the back half of the quarter, it felt like there is a clear reprioritization of capital, in particular, amongst some of our national account customers, with some of the more recent deal activity that's been announced. We feel that could impact the what we thought would be kind of an improving schedule for power, backup power projects in the second half of the year, we're not feeling as good about that. Non-residential construction, third quarter in a row declined, which we're starting to see as we noted in our prepared remarks. We're starting to see lower quotation activity in the second quarter for our industrial distributors, which – again, we're very pleased by the way with that C&I business. It's done very well in the face of, I think, a fairly muted growth environment, certainly here in North America. We believe we've been taking share there. We believe that the expanded product lines we've got, and the improvements in distribution and the strides we've made there are paying off, but we can't ignore the trends. And the recent trends there in the second quarter were to lower quotations, which we believe portends to a potential slowdown in the second half. So that was again something, as we started the year, we felt a lot stronger about that business than we feel today. And then lastly to your point with residential, it's interesting. Our original guidance for the year contemplated kind of a flattish type of scenario for activations in the first half of the year. And on balance, that's kind of what we saw, but the problem was the pacing from first quarter to second quarter, the trending was negative. And in particular in the Northeast region, which has a fairly outsized impact, we saw a weakening there that we really didn't anticipate. And the other markets outside of the Northeast are up modestly for the year, which we like, and again, I think, speaks to the resilience of the category, but I think we just continue to be struck by just how large the Northeast market and how fast it had grown. I think offsetting some of that is some encouraging signs around the fact that our distribution levels, our dealer counts are really very close to their peak levels, which were reached at the end of 2013. So I think we like where we're at there. We're just – I think we can't ignore the fact that the trends for activations were lower, second quarter outages were considerably lower than last year, which did not help at all. And we really exit the quarter here with probably a higher inventory level. So what we're kind of anticipating in the third quarter is probably a bit of a destocking event that needs to happen.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: If outages remain low.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: So if outages remain low, to York's point, if they recover to normalized levels, or as we said, if we see a season develop that could certainly change, but that's kind of how we're playing it out. And that is, I know it's a long winded way to answer your question, but there is a lot of moving pieces, and just wanted to give you added color there. York, you might have...
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: So, Jeff – so if we're changing our guidance assumption here that we're laying out here is about a 5% change from prior guidance, I think you're right, a good three quarters of that is C&I related, and about a quarter of that is resi related, just taking a more conservative view on the second half relative to the trends we're seeing in the second quarter. So I think that's the best way to characterize our outlook.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just a couple of quick follow-ups. So I'm surprised how often you mentioned Brexit. Can you just quantify your UK business, because I had Tower Light is kind of $50 million business on $1.3 billion, and maybe only a portion of that UK. And then just can you tell us what your price was on your buyback? And how you're thinking about buybacks going forward? Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah, I think on the – just to mention – we did mention Brexit a couple of times, and I think it's not only the direct impact to the Tower Light business and the lockup in CapEx, I think when you look at our International – our new segment reporting here the International segment, that was a disappointment really as a result of what we saw in the pullback in CapEx spending. We attribute that to the direct exposure in the UK, those national rental accounts. But what we're a little bit concerned about is obviously the uncertainty of Brexit spreading into something, some additional malaise economically throughout Europe. So I think there's a little bit of a pins and needles kind of approach there by customers across the European Continent right now. So while our direct exposure to the UK is relatively small and your assumption for Tower Light is pretty close. Again, I think it's the broader fear of the uncertainty around that, and then, York, I think on the buyback...
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, it's about $37 on average.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: And then I think our views on buybacks going forward again, we've got there is another $65 million call it of open-to-buy, if you will, on our authorized repurchase program. So at the current levels that we see the stock price trading at, we're buyers of our stock. Should we see a season develop and should the stock price accelerate upward, we may change our views on capital allocation priorities, but today, we see buybacks as a – it's a pretty good return on the investment.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. We don't have any debt principal payments on the horizon, requirements that is, we have our M&A pipeline. But, like Aaron said, we have $65 million open on our buyback, so those will all be factored into our priorities.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Great.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Hey, good morning, Mike.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Mike.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, Aaron, would you – great color on all those end markets, could you also touch on the rental side too. And maybe just talk about what the channel partners are saying there. How much cannibalization is still going on with some of that oil and gas weakness. Are they getting to the point where the inventory levels are bouncing out a little bit on that channel? And just some thoughts going forward.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah, I think, the big thing, Mike, as we talk to, and we have exposure to all the major rental houses here, not only domestically, but also internationally now through Pramac and through Tower Light. So I think we get a pretty full picture of what's going on there. And certainly here domestically in North America, the concern is around utilization rates of fleet. And so as utilization rates remain low, and particularly the categories of product that we play in, right, which we kind of classify as support or ancillary type products. So, lighting, tower, dewatering type products, heating products. These are products that generally maybe but for heat, but the rest of those products are generally used in a support role on the site, or in construction, or at the oil and gas frac site. And as a result, what we've seen is that equipment is pretty fungible. So, it's easy to go back into the general rental market, when it has been coming off of rent, in the oil and gas patch. And so that kind of tidal wave of additional product going into the general rental markets has really depressed utilization rates in those markets. So when we talk to these end channel partners about what concerns them most, it's just really the poor utilization fleet at this point. And unfortunately, because used equipment prices are low as a result of the influx of all this equipment, there's not a lot of places to put it. So taking it to auction or secondary markets, traditional secondary market channels is really a poor return, really impacts the overall return profile of the equipment in that business. So I think a lot of the fleet partners have chosen to kind of wait it out, and have the equipment age out as opposed to selling it out. And so, I think the one thing that we hear continuously here is the fleet's not getting any younger, it continually ages, and maybe they can squeeze additional time out of it in months as we measure it. We can see a lengthening of the amount of ownership time of fleet assets, in particular in these support categories. But until utilization comes back, which also by the way gives them – equates directly to pricing power. So rental rates remain kind of stifled as well as a result of poor utilization. Until that kind of recovers, it feels like we're bumping along the bottom though. I don't think we feel like it's going to get a lot worse, it's just unfortunately there isn't going to be a catalyst like higher oil prices, at least in the near-term, in our view, to kind of shake ourselves off of this in a faster way. So I think it's just a matter of kind of waiting it out, and letting things age out. So that's kind of the, again, long-winded answer, but kind of that's really an amalgamation of the views of our fleet partners.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks for that. And then on Country Home Products, sounds like that's performing quite well, maybe just an update on some of the cross-selling initiatives that you guys are working on, on that side. How did the end markets – or how did that unit perform for you through the first peak season? And then any change on expectations there going forward?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. CHP has been a great – that's a great company for us. It's very well run. It has a very good sense of its purpose in terms of the types of products that it delivers to the market, and who it delivers them to. The cross-selling opportunities, and we've talked about this on previous calls, and we've seen some very nice – we've received some nice placement of some of their products at what we would call more value-oriented price points is kind of the terminology we used in the prepared remarks, at some of our channel partners. So in the retail space, those companies carry some of the products that CHP has, and we've gotten some nice – we've had a couple of nice wins there, and those will roll here in the fall season and into next spring season as well. So we're encouraged by our thesis playing out as it relates to some of those things. I think where the thesis maybe originally wasn't as strong, but has proven to be playing out very well for us is just what a great marketing company CHP really is. And they've been very helpful on two fronts for us. One, we launched a new inverter-style generator, portable generator last year, late last year, beginning of this year, really targeted at the recreational segment. So it goes straight up against one of the leaders in the industry there. We believe we have a superior product in terms of technology, in terms of sound level, and CHP has been wonderful in helping us orient our marketing around that product through use of infomercial and short-form media, and through campaigns to kind of get a grassroots type of demand around that product, and it's been quite successful, and we credit CHP with helping us with that. And the other area would be, their critical analysis of our home standby marketing process and sales process. So they've been very helpful in pointing out as we kind of deconstruct the sales process, and I think we look at it more than anybody is the kind of share we have and the amount of calories that we burn around home standby, at this company, to drive that category forward. We deconstruct continuously the sales process and understanding what works, what doesn't work. But sometimes you get too close to it, forest through the trees kind of thing, and CHP helped us kind of take a fresh look at that process and identify some critical leakage out of the funnel, sales funnel as we look at it, where leads were leaking out and other areas to kind of improve close rates and improve the consumer touch points, which is really their expertise area, every touch point. They're very, very in tune with every electronic touch point, every telephonic touch point, every printed touch point, every interaction with the consumer, we want to leave them with a high-quality experience, and CHP is very in tune with that. So it's been very helpful. So it's been from my standpoint, a great company to work with so far.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks for the time.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Mike. Operating: And your next question is from Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, Aaron. Hey, York.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning Brian.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Good morning, Brian.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: I'm wondering if you could give us any color regarding organic revenue growth or decline in, first of all, in resi and C&I and then in the new segments Domestic and International, just any help on organic revenue growth rates would be great.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Brain. Yeah, so, I think on the product class side, if you think about the Domestic, residential is basically a Domestic category. There is a little bit there in the International side, but when you think about residential it's mostly there in the Domestic side. And as we call it, residential did have some nice organic growth during the quarter for the reasons we talked about, high single-digits, from an organic growth standpoint. On the C&I standpoint, from a C&I standpoint, globally, given the oil and gas concerns that we've had, and then the new UK, Brexit uncertainty exposure with our Tower Light business, that C&I had organic declines this quarter of around 17%, 18%, so still seeing a drag on growth from oil and gas and now a little bit in the UK there.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. So, and I'll have to sort through this after the call, I guess, further, but you're saying – I guess the International business is really primarily, or exclusively C&I...
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, think of International, yeah, correct, think of International primarily C&I, and think of residential as more of a Domestic category.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. But it's not a clean comparison between – I guess Domestic isn't the new resi right here exactly, right?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: There is a little bit of resi in International.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: There is some resi in International. And frankly we expect to grow the residential component internationally. That's one of the thesis is, theses, if you will, with the acquisition of Pramac is to extend our, what we do well with our residential here in the U.S., we think there is an opportunity for pockets around the world where that makes sense for the category. But right now, as it exists, it's primarily C&I in that International segment.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. So reviewing this – so resi is up high single digits organically in the quarter, C&I is down 17% to 18% and....
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Correct.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: (46:23) those growth rates though what I see are similar growth rates or declines for Domestic and International, so like Domestic up high single digits organically in the quarter or do you have that?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, we haven't provided that, but I think you can get a general idea on our product, consolidated product class base, what's going on there from a regional standpoint as well.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then just one more. You mentioned destocking might need to occur, as we move into the second half of the year. Did you mention where the field inventory is at the end of second quarter 2016 versus 2015?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. So end of second quarter – it is higher. This year end of second quarter versus last year end of second quarter. So we reflected that in our guidance statement here that we talked about third quarter being, on a consolidated basis, revenue being roughly flat with prior year. So that would – we've factored in – if outages remain low, which is what the assumption is in our guidance, you'll have a bit of a de-stock event as a result of that higher field inventory this year versus last year.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: In the past you've mentioned it's 10% higher or 5% higher, can you give us any ballpark feel for how high?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: It's higher, but it's not dramatically higher.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Ross.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I just want to elaborate on your comments, or hoping you could elaborate on your comments on the Northeast. So I mean do you guys feel like when there is an outage even on a very local level like you're not getting the order intake that you might have gotten three years or four years ago, and you feel it all like that's a sign of any type of market saturation in that region of the country. Just curious on your thoughts on that.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: No, I mean we look at the penetration rates on not only on local level, but also in the regional level and the penetration rates are still very low, mid single-digits in the Northeast. So we think there's a lot of runway there. It's, Ross, just, I think, the overall fact that we just have not had kind of outages to even in that, particularly, in that area of the country to kind of drive the conversation around the category. So it's just become a tougher market to sell into. Obviously it weighs on channel partners. There's inventory concerns right, because that is something that is always something we look at kind of regionally as well, but it just feels – it doesn't feel like there is a saturation point that we're hitting. I wouldn't say that. I think it's just the growth rate slowed in that region, and it slowed up faster than we thought it was going to than we were planning on it. And that's really I think the kind of the crux of the issue for us.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: In terms of like promotional activity that you focused on and you mentioned, I think, a stronger sell in, into hurricane season, part of that was tied to the stronger activations at the end of the first quarter. But are you having to promote more, lot more aggressively than you have in the past? And is that impacting your gross margin within the standby business?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: No, I mean the promotion activity is kind of on par with what we would say as kind of the year following a non-season, a non-event season, so – or a low outage environment. So it's been the same. Roughly, I wouldn't characterize Q2 as being an outsized amount of promotion running through, in particular – definitely not impacting EBITDA margins. But it was better sentiment, better buying sentiment, because we had two things happen. One we had lower inventory levels coming into the second quarter, and because of the higher activation rates that's why that happened in Q1. But then also, I think there's been more talk this year around the potential for a season this year. This La Niña versus El Niño, and the kind of transition away from that environment that was not conducive to outages to maybe an environment, what, meteorologically there would be more conducive outages. We're not meteorologists, so, I mean, for us, we watch the forecast, but we know that our channel partners watch the forecasts as well, and kind of mid-quarter in the second quarter, it became a little easier to sell when NOAA comes out with a stronger hurricane season prediction and others as well. So that was helpful in the second quarter, and puts people in more of a – our channel partners in particularly in more of a buying mood. So that's really what led to that in the second quarter.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly, could you give us a little more color on your capital structure targets in the medium term. I mean, I think your leverage is a little bit higher than it has been in the more recent past at least as you diversified into C&I, and obviously end markets are tough right now. You guys are buying back a little bit of stock. You hadn't really bought back stock in the past. But just curious, why all the cash was not really going towards debt reduction right now, and sort of where do you think you can get, where do you want to be in sort of more on an 18-month to 24-month level in terms of net debt to EBITDA?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I mean, we – hi, Ross, it's York. So we've consistently talked about leverage levels, target leverage levels of say 2 times to 3 times. At 3.7 times that does not in any way bother us, given the amount of cash, given the amount of EBITDA that we convert to cash that 3.7 times for us is different to than 3.7 times for maybe somebody that doesn't convert as much of that EBITDA to cash. So we're not worried about the 3.7 times. I think the key there is you comment about, hey, where will we be 18 months, 24 months from now, at these, what maybe characterized as trough EBITDA level, you'll grow back into that 2 times to 3 times target, relatively quickly, just as you resume that pick up in EBITDA. So, I think, we're comfortable with our leverage, and I think you see that illustrated by the fact that we are buying back stock and we're comfortable with that situation.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: I would just add Ross, that I mean, our liability structure is very cost effective, and there are no covenants. And so, we believe, we've got a very good liability structure, and to take that out at the current rate environment, it doesn't...
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: At all plus 2.75 (53:33)
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah, just doesn't feel to be a good use of capital. So we believe that buying back stock presents a better use of capital and the acquisitions we've done, and obviously the things that we focused on in terms of reprioritizing here. Now if the rate environment changes, maybe that gets us to re-think that, but at this point, we think that EBITDA growth off of these, as York characterized trough levels, I think, is a better way to de-lever than it is to pay down the debt, in our opinion.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Hey, Jerry.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Can you folks talk about where you view normalized EBITDA margins for your International segment, and how long it takes to get there? I think you mentioned the target is 8% for this year, I know you're in the middle of integrating Pramac just, can you touch on where you think you could take the margin structure longer term, and talk about how the procurement integration, specifically is going and how is the opportunity set evolving from what you initially expected?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Jerry, this is York. So, I think if you recall, we've said a number of times. So the International segment, if you will, is made up of the Pramac business, the Ottomotores business in Mexico that was acquired, Tower Light. And if you recall, our strategy with regards to margin expansion for our acquisitions is to take a business that's maybe mid-to-high single-digit EBITDA margins, in the case of some of these acquisitions like a Pramac or an Ottomotores, and then try to double that through revenue synergies and cost synergies. So we've seen, we've demonstrated that we can do that in other acquisitions, Pramac just closed. So taking something that mid-to-high single-digit margin, we want to double that. And that's I guess we're in the middle of that maturation, if you will, with Ottomotores and Tower Light, which is why we're at 8%, and we believe we can take that higher as we execute on the synergies with Pramac. So I think that's probably the best way to characterize our goals there with our International EBITDA margins.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And York, can you just touch on the timeframe and how is the purchasing integration tracking on Pramac?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I mean some of it's low-hanging fruit, so you can get those costs, and they're mainly bill of material cost reductions as you leverage the scale and your supply chain. Some of it is low-hanging fruit, but inevitably some of it might be design changes, and those take a longer period of time to get that through the design cycle and then get that through the P&L. So I would say that's more of a long – 18 months.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: 18 months to 24 months.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: To probably get that ultimately through on the design. The globalization of the platforms, and there is obviously, as York said, there is some of the component costs. It's easy to get some synergies right away, but some of the more, some of the deeper redesign of the product, so that we can really maximize the synergies. I think are going to take a little more time.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: And then a part of that too is just leveraging the fixed costs on a higher top line too. That takes a little time to execute on the revenue synergies as well, and there is some product – as you expand our offerings out there can be some improved mix as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, good morning.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: First question is on the new presentation style. Are you going to continue presenting the resi and the C&I products as well as Domestic, International and you are going to recast the Domestic, International results historically?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I think so the – yeah, the product classes that we have, those will continue. That's for the requirements that you are required to disclose your product classes, and that's why we have done that historically. With the Pramac acquisition that's the catalyst to – which expanded our International business, accelerated that strategy rapidly here, which was the catalyst to sort of introduce these new Domestic, International segments. And so the International segment was pretty small in the past, so that's sort of why you don't – we're not really going to recast anything because it was small in the past. So it's really just the catalyst of Pramac acquisition, which is causing the two segment reporting structure, but the product classes will continue as well because that's a requirement.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just another one, I guess, it's going to be maybe harder to answer. But I guess, if we talk about the power outage activity in North America being well below historic levels at – we've gone through a number of quarters now where it's at that level, and I can't recall exactly what the historic database is on tracking that, but it's not something like 20 years, I don't believe. At what point does the current level of activity start to really look like maybe this is closer to normal than well-below normal? Just interested in your thoughts on that, Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. Charley, I mean, again, our database of outage severity, which is a proprietary calculation, we've been tracking for five years to six years now. You're right, it's not 20 years of data, but what we do have is 20 years of government data, that on outages and although maybe not accumulated in the same fashion that we accumulate it, outages over the long haul have been traditionally higher, or historically higher, and in my 20 plus years here at the company, we've seen outage activity higher. This is a very, very low level. So again, it's kind of big pattern stuff. We don't know why it happens in the multi-year cycles that it happens, but it seems to be, you'll get a couple of years of active outage environment, and then followed by several years of inactive. So it's just kind of on, off cycle that is inherent to – and a lot, again, 70% of all outages caused by weather. So I think those big patterns are weather-related, and again some of the El Niño, La Niña kind of cycles that happen here, and I think are the root cause of some of that. So, we don't try to predict that. All we can do is say, let's look at the current environment, let's give our best, put our forecasting ability and our historical kind of perspective on this, and come up with our best view on outlook. And that's kind of what we've done. But again I think you look at where outages are at, and where they – even in that six years of data that we do have where they've been even before the major outages in 2011 and 2012. They were – the outages – the outage activity has been higher. So we just – we characterize this as kind of an ultra low level. You can also look at one other area I would point to, we're starting to look at, we look at insurance losses, basically non-flooding insurance losses, because the flood related stuff doesn't necessary generate power outages, but wind damage related insurance losses are down and have been down in the last – I mean, it's been a decade since there has been a major event in Florida, which is really unheard of meteorologically. So again we just characterize the current period as being really below normal, well below normal.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from John Quealy with Canaccord. Your line is open.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey guys. I appreciate you squeezing me on. Just two questions. First -
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, John.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey York, can you talk about your price discipline across the businesses. I think you gave us a little bit of detail on resi standby, but talk about the whole portfolio, how is the price starts moving forward. And then second, all the acquisitions you're doing, talk about what's in your control in terms of potential future cost synergies, or how you feel comfortable that you can control your own destiny on OpEx. Thank you guys.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: John, this is York. I mean, I think one thing to point to on the pricing side of your question about pricing dynamics is our gross margin bridge. There was really no impact, or very nominal impact on price year-over-year in the gross margin bridge. So, excluding that inventory step-up, gross margins were up 140 basis points, and there was really no pricing impact. So I think we haven't seen a degradation on the price side.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: No, but for the netting of the promotions and things that we do. But again, those are normal seasonal...
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: (1:03:03) it's normal.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. We feel that's pretty normal. But I think as we look forward to pricing, John, we think about that. I think we're in the middle of – this is the time of the year when we – as we kind of gear up for the forecasting season here for 2017, start to take a critical eye towards just where our commodity is trending, where our currency is trending, and the other impact, the other inputs, if you will, into what would drive pricing in the industry across all of our products. So we don't see though any macro kind of competitive pressures, or other undue kind of forces there that would say, we either have pricing power in an area or we need pricing to reduce. I think we've always taken the position that we are – we want to be very competitive in price, and I believe that we do that with a very competitive cost structure that enables us to be very competitive on price. I believe that even in markets where we lead like home standby, we have the most competitive pricing position across the broad spectrum of products in the industry. And we want to – we believe that that's important, especially in that market where affordability is what we believe unlocks the next layer of demand. We don't think that that means we've got to take and reduce prices on home standby generators by a immaterial amount. As we've said, we think that when we look at the total cost of ownership, we think there's opportunity area there to continue to bring installation costs down. So that's our focus. Penetration is still low, and there is still a lot of opportunity there. So C&I products pricing, that obviously has impacted more broadly by the input costs of steel and other things, and obviously we see steel costs up year-over-year, in a lot of cases up by 40% actually.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: We'll evaluate that.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: So we'll evaluate that. And as we think about 2017 and then the pricing environment there that will start to come into our decision process. On the acquisitions, I think your question was kind of around the OpEx, opportunities for OpEx there, and I think as we think of OpEx in both of the entities that we talk about on acquisitions and results at least in the second quarter around CHP and Pramac, the ability to leverage the OpEx through – again the revenue synergies that we've talked about. With CHP, I've talked about some of those. With .Pramac, there are opportunities there to take some of our mobile products and connect them with their customers and their mobile generator lines, and then conversely the ability to maybe take some of their products down into some of our markets in Latin America, where some of those products are maybe European style product, in particular in markets like Brazil. It's probably a better product than maybe the product coming from North America. So we think there's some opportunity there. And the natural gas products across the pond here into Europe where there are markets where natural gas is starting to become a more important play for backup power. We think we'll have an opportunity. Again growing the top line though, Pramac has a large OpEx expense load relative to their sales volume today. CHP is the same, but for different reasons. Pramac is really because they've got far flung operations, 14 sales branches serving 150 countries. We really want to grow the top line there with all things I talked about. And then CHP a good chunk of their business is direct-to-consumer, so they bear a much higher expense load as it relates to all the marketing costs that they absorb on a direct basis. So the more we can expand their top line and leverage that as well is going to result in improved EBITDA margins over time. So that's kind of how we view those businesses.
Operator: I'm not showing any further questions. So I'll now turn the call back over to Aaron Jagdfeld, President and CEO, for closing remarks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director: Thank you, operator. We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning, and we look forward to our third quarter 2016 earnings release, which we anticipate will be at some point in late October or early November. That concludes our call this morning. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We'll begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements.

I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our overall financial performance for the first quarter exceeded our most recent guidance expectations as the increasing diversification of our business helped to offset the ongoing headwinds being experienced within oil and gas-related end markets. Shipments of our legacy residential products came in modestly ahead of our expectations, benefiting from higher home standby activation levels due to a relatively mild winter season along with a more favorable power outage environment as compared to our assumptions. Also, we experienced better than expected shipments from the recent acquisitions of Country Home Products and Pramac, and shipments to telecom national account customers were also more favorable due to higher levels of capital spending by certain customers. This outperformance helped to more than offset additional weakness within portions of our commercial and industrial products, primarily driven by lower than expected sales of mobile products as a result of low and volatile energy prices. Adjusted EBITDA margins also came in slightly ahead of our expectations, benefiting from lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. On a year-over-year basis, net sales in the first quarter were $287 million as compared to $312 million in the prior year as we faced stronger comparisons for both residential and commercial and industrial products. As compared to the prior year, shipments of home standby and portable generators declined as expected due to higher levels of backlog and lower levels of field inventory entering the prior-year first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2016, which more than offset the improvements in end-user demand during the quarter. Although the first quarter experienced a more favorable power outage environment when compared to our assumptions, this represents only a single quarterly data point, and outage levels were still well below the long-term baseline average. While the power outage environment is obviously beyond our control, when market conditions inevitably improve at more sustained levels we believe we are very well-positioned to fully leverage the innovative sales and marketing programs for home standby generators which have only been implemented within the past three years. In the meantime, we remain focused on a number of strategic initiatives to increase the awareness, availability and affordability for home standby generators, including specific projects and activities targeted towards generating more sales leads, improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of these products. Regarding our mobile products, energy prices experienced another sizable move downward during the early portion of the first quarter of 2016, particularly with the price of oil, but have improved significantly from the trough levels seen in mid-February. However, the volatility and overall low levels of prices continues to have a worse-than-expected impact on capital spending for mobile products as our rental equipment customers deferred new equipment spending during the quarter. Accordingly, this has had a significant impact on our current quarter mobile product shipments relative to the prior year. As a result of this ongoing and significant downturn in capital spending within the oil and gas industry, we initiated a number of meaningful but necessary expense-reduction actions during the first quarter to better align our current cost structure with customer demand. The cost actions being taken include the consolidation of the Bismarck, North Dakota heater facility into our Berlin, Wisconsin facility by July of this year. In addition, we are implementing other facility footprint reductions, numerous head count and operating expense adjustments, along with recording certain non-cash asset write-downs and other one-time product charges related to the MAC heater line. Given these actions, first quarter results include the impact of $7.1 million of nonrecurring, pre-tax charges related to these business optimization and restructuring costs. While these cost-reduction actions are significant, we believe they are necessary to address the adverse impacts from the severe and extended downturn in energy prices that continue to have a negative impact on industry fleet purchases. We estimate the cost actions will yield between $4 million to $5 million of annualized cost savings once fully implemented by the fourth quarter of 2016. Although near-term market conditions are challenging, we remain optimistic on the long-term need for mobile products that are essential to oil and gas drilling and production activities. Now a couple of quick comments on the remainder of our C&I business. Shipments to our telecom national account customers were down during the quarter as the overall soft capital spending environment that persisted in 2015 continued into the early part of 2016. We also saw a decrease in shipments to our North American industrial distributors in the quarter as a result of lower quotation levels experienced in the second half of 2015. The Latin American region remained challenging as well as a result of weakening local currencies, lower energy prices and reduced infrastructure spending in these countries. While these broad-based headwinds affected our C&I business in the first quarter, we are seeing encouraging signs of increasing demand for these products as we enter the second quarter. Improving nonresidential construction trends, the relative stabilization as of late of Latin American currencies, a firmer capital spending environment for telecom, and normal seasonality are all contributing to an increase in quoting and order activity, which is expected to lead to a sequential improvement in shipments for C&I products. The first quarter of 2016 includes the results of the Pramac acquisition, which closed on March 1. Headquartered in Siena, Italy, Pramac is a leading global manufacturer of stationery, mobile and portable generators sold in over 150 countries through a broad distribution network. Pramac employs over 600 people across its four manufacturing plants and 14 commercial branches located across the globe. It is important to note the vast majority of Pramac's net sales are classified within C&I products with the balance relating to portable generators classified within residential products, along with a smaller portion of aftermarket parts sales classified within other products. Although not much time has passed since closing, our integration efforts are well underway, and we are making encouraging progress in evaluating and pursuing a variety of synergies. These include the pursuit of global cross-selling opportunities, including selling Pramac's stationery, mobile and portable generators through Generac's existing international distribution channels while also selling Generac's natural gas generators and our broad array of mobile equipment into Pramac's distribution. Also, we have made good initial progress in evaluating some compelling cost synergies and opportunities to better optimize existing facilities and use the combined scale of the two companies as we leverage our collective global supply chain. We are excited about the diversification benefits from Pramac as the acquisition significantly expands our geographic footprint and revenue base, essentially doubling our international sales mix outside the U.S. and Canada, and elevating us to a major player in the global power generation market. We are also making encouraging progress with the integration of Country Home Products, which closed in October – or excuse me, in August of 2015. Recall that CHP is a leading manufacturer of professional-grade engine-powered equipment sold primarily under the DR brand and used in a wide variety of property maintenance tasks. The company's products are largely sold in North America through catalogs, outdoor power equipment dealers and select regional retailers and include field and brush mowers, chippers and shredders, trimmers, leaf vacuums, stump grinders and log splitters. We are excited about the potential cross-selling opportunities for these products, and we are gaining valuable insights as CHP's direct-to-consumer expertise is helping us further refine our targeted marketing skills as we work to broaden the awareness and appeal of home standby generators. This acquisition also provides additional scale to our existing platform of power equipment products, allowing us to target certain cost synergies as we leverage our global sourcing and manufacturing capabilities. We believe the benefits that Country Home Products provides, particularly as we enter the seasonally strong peak demand second quarter for CHP's products, is an important part of our overall strategy of further diversifying our company. I would now like to turn the call back over to York to discuss first quarter results in more detail. York?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the first quarter of 2016 were $286.5 million as compared to $311.8 million in the first quarter of 2015, including $37.2 million of contribution from the recent acquisitions of Country Home Products and Pramac. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales during the first quarter of 2016 increased to $159 million as compared to $156.8 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was due to a combination of contributions from the recent Country Home Products and Pramac acquisitions, which was mostly offset by a decline in organic shipments of home standby generators and, to a lesser extent, portable generators. The decline in home standby generators was primarily due to higher levels of backlog and lower levels of field inventory entering the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2016. Recall that as we entered 2015, we were coming off a period of record activation rates as a result of heightened power outage activity. This situation did not exist entering the first quarter of 2016 and as a result caused the tough prior-year comparison. However, as Aaron mentioned, end user demand in the form of home standby activations were up modestly year over year in Q1 2016, which helped to partially offset these prior-year headwinds. Looking at our commercial industrial products, net sales for the first quarter of 2016 were $103 million as compared to $133.8 million for the comparable period in 2015. The decline was primarily due to a significant reduction in shipments of mobile products into oil and gas and general rental markets as a result of lower capital spending caused by the substantial decline in energy prices. To a lesser extent, shipments of C&I products were also impacted by a decline in Latin America along with lower shipments to industrial distributors and telecom national account customers. Partially offsetting these declines was a modest contribution from the Pramac acquisition which closed on March 1, 2016. The negative impact of foreign currency on C&I organic product sales was only approximately 1% during the quarter. Net sales for the other products category were $24.6 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $21.2 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of aftermarket parts sales from the recent Country Home Products and Pramac acquisitions. To a lesser extent, the increase was also due to additional service parts sales resulting from our growing base of stationary and mobile products in the market. Gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2016 was 34.2% compared to 32.9% in the prior-year first quarter, which includes the impact of $2.7 million of nonrecurring charges related to the oil and gas downturn that are classified within cost of goods sold. Excluding the impact of these charges, gross profit margin was 35.2%, an improvement of 230 basis points over the prior year. The strong increase in gross margins was driven by a variety of factors, including the following: a favorable overall product mix, given a higher sales of mix of residential products in the current-year quarter, including the acquisition of Country Home Products, partially offset by the addition of Pramac sales; the favorable impact of lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar in recent quarters; and the fact that gross margin in the prior year was negatively impacted by temporary increases in certain costs associated with the West Coast port congestion as well as other overhead-related costs that did not repeat in the current-year quarter. Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2016 increased $13.4 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015, which includes the impact of $4.4 million of non-recurring charges related to the oil and gas downturn that are classified within operating expenses. Excluding the impact of these charges, operating expenses for the quarter increased $9 million as compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with Country Home Products and Pramac acquisitions partially offset by reductions in certain organic selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the company was $49.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $57.1 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin before deducting for non-controlling interests was 17.4% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 18.3% in the prior-year quarter. The decline in adjusted EBITDA margins compared to prior year was primarily attributable to the increase in operating expenses partially offset by the improvement in gross margins as a result of the factors just discussed. GAAP net income attributable to the company for the first quarter of 2016 was $10.2 million as compared to $19.7 million for the first quarter of 2015. The current-year net income includes the impact of the $7.1 million non-recurring pre-tax oil and gas charges, as previously discussed. GAAP income taxes during the first quarter of 2016 were $5.7 million, or a 35.9% tax rate, as compared to $11 million, also a 35.9% tax rate for the prior year. Adjusted net income attributable to the company as defined in our earnings release was $30.9 million in the current-year quarter versus $34.1 million in the prior year. This decline over the prior year is primarily the result of the overall decline in operating earnings as previously discussed partially offset by $3.3 million in lower cash income taxes. Diluted net income per share attributable to the company on a GAAP basis was $0.15 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.28 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted net income per share attributable to the company as reconciled in our earnings release was $0.46 for the current-year quarter compared to $0.49 in the prior year. With regards to cash income taxes, the first quarter of 2016 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $1.8 million as compared to $5.1 million in the prior-year quarter. This year-over-year decline in cash income taxes for the quarter was primarily the result of lower pre-tax earnings along with a lower expected cash income tax rate for the full year 2016 of approximately 9% as compared to the prior year of approximately 17%. As a reminder, our favorable tax shield through annual intangible amortization in our tax return results in our expected cash income tax rate being significantly lower than our currently projected GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% for 2016. As we drive profitability over time, cash income taxes can be estimated by applying a projected longer-term GAAP income tax rate of 36% on pre-tax profits going forward and then deducting the approximately $50 million of annual cash tax savings from the tax shield each year through 2021. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was consistent with typical first quarter seasonality and only declined modestly to $15.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $18.7 million in the same period last year. It's important to note the Pramac acquisition added approximately $50 million of primary working capital to our balance sheet as of March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, we had a total of $1.09 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs, and $69.4 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $1.02 billion. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2016 was 3.9 times on an as-reported basis and was 3.7 times on a pro forma basis with the Pramac and CHP acquisitions. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, there was approximately $149 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. The company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the first quarter of 2016 under its existing share repurchase program announced in August of 2015. Remember that this program authorizes the company to repurchase up to $200 million of its common stock over a 24-month period, and to date, a total of 3.3 million shares of common stock have been repurchased for approximately $100 million. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on outlook for 2016.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Thanks, York. We are maintaining our prior guidance for full year 2016. Net sales are still expected to increase 10% to 12% with total organic sales on a constant currency basis still anticipated to be down between 5% to 7%. Nearly all of this decline is expected to be from ongoing weakness in mobile product shipments into the oil and gas and general rental markets. Importantly, this top-line outlook assumes no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment and no improvement in power outage severity for the remainder of the year relative to the very low levels experienced during 2015. We still expect the seasonality of quarterly results to demonstrate a normal historical pattern, assuming no major outage events occur during the year, with the first half representing approximately 44% to 45% of total sales and the second half approximately 55% to 56%. Specifically for the second quarter, we anticipate net sales to increase sequentially on an as-reported basis and to be in the range of $350 million to $360 million, primarily due to normal seasonality and a full quarter contribution from the Pramac acquisition. Looking at our guidance by product class, for residential products we still expect net sales to increase in the low-teens range during 2016, which assumes approximately flat year-over-year organic growth with the difference attributed to the Country Home Products acquisition and, to a lesser degree, some residential product sales from the Pramac acquisition. As previously mentioned, this sales guidance includes the assumption that power outage severity does not improve for the remainder of 2016. As a reminder, should the baseline power outage environment normalize relative to the very low levels experienced in 2015, or if there is a major power outage event in 2016, it's likely we could exceed these expectations. With regards to our commercial and industrial products, we still expect net sales to increase approximately 10% on an as-reported basis for 2016, which includes the benefit of C&I products acquired in the Pramac transaction. Organic net sales for C&I are now expected to decline in the mid-teens arrange, which includes only a modest expected negative impact from foreign currency of less than 1%. The decline in organic net sales is primarily due to the continued strong headwinds with shipments of mobile products into oil and gas and general rental customers as these markets continue to search for a bottom during 2016. Gross margins, excluding the $2.7 million of non-recurring charges recorded during the first quarter, are expected to improve by approximately 125 basis points as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding amortization of intangibles and the $4.4 million of non-recurring charges recorded during the first quarter, are expected to increase approximately 200 basis points as compared to 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins before deducting for non-controlling interests are still expected to be approximately 20% for full year 2016 with some variation throughout the year as a result of normal seasonality. Similar to the pattern experienced in the prior year, second half 2016 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 450 basis points higher than the first half as a result of increasing benefit from product cost reductions, a more favorable product mix and improving SG&A leverage on higher sales volumes through the back half of the year. Specifically for the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately flat sequentially as compared to the first quarter of 2016, which is similar seasonality to the prior year, but then improve sequentially during each of the third and fourth quarters. As a reminder, we have a majority interest ownership position in Pramac, and there will continue to be a minority non-controlling interest with this acquisition that must be deducted when forecasting adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS for full year 2016. We expect to continue generating significant free cash flow given our superior margin profile, low cost of debt, favorable tax attributes and capital-efficient operating model. We are maintaining our guidance for full year 2016 free cash flow generation with the conversion of adjusted net income still anticipated to be over 90%, resulting in improved levels over the prior year. Lastly, regarding our outlook commentary, we are providing an update to some guidance details to help model out the company's earnings per share and cash flows for 2016. We expect interest expense to be in the range of $46 million to $47 million. The forecast for interest expense includes $41.5 million to $42.5 million of cash outflow for debt service costs, plus approximately $4.5 million for deferred financing costs and original issue discount amortization for our credit facility. Cash taxes are expected to be approximately $14 million to $15 million, which translates into an anticipated full-year 2016 cash income tax rate of approximately 9%. Depreciation expense is forecasted to be between $21 million and $21.5 million. GAAP intangible amortization expense is expected to be between $33 million and $33.5 million. Stock compensation expense is forecast to be approximately $11.5 million to $12 million, and capital expenditures for the year are expected to be approximately $35 million to $36 million, which is still only approximately 2.5% of our forecasted net sales for 2016. In closing this morning, although our first quarter results reflect continued softness in certain of our end markets, we have been focused on controlling costs and we continue to make strategic investments in new products and technologies as well as the necessary infrastructure to support the next leg of growth that we believe will occur as markets eventually improve. The integration of the Pramac business will be an important area of focus for us as this strategic acquisition builds significantly upon the transactions we have completed over the past five years that have transformed Generac from a North American-focused, power generation-only company into a global power products company. As we think about the future for Generac, we remain optimistic regarding the long-term secular growth opportunities that exist for several areas of our business, and we intend to leverage our strong liquidity position as we evaluate our priority uses of capital to increase shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks and, at this time, we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Your line is open.
James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is James Picariello.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Good morning.
James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: A quick question. Good morning. So for the C&I guidance, you did take that down a bit from down low-teens organically to now down mid-teens. Can you just sort of flesh out the incremental weakness that you are obviously seeing in mobile versus the pickup in telecom that you did mention with respect to orders in the quarter?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yes. This is York. As we highlighted, we have seen continued weakness in oil and gas as we try to find a bottom there. We've reflected that in our organic C&I outlook. You're correct in terms of highlighting now expecting a decline – organic decline in C&I in the mid-teens range. There are offsets to that, though. We are seeing some outperformance on the Pramac outlook, which is helping to offset that. So if you recall, our as-reported C&I outlook is still up approximately 10%. So we are holding that. But the pieces inside that are organically down a little bit more because of oil and gas but offset by outperformance with Pramac. So that's where a lot of the puts and takes are relative to our previous guidance.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: I would just add that that previous guidance, when given, oil took another leg down during the first quarter, and I think that kind of continued to put a damper on the fleet purchases that normally happen in oil and gas. And then the spillover effect into the general rental markets that we are witnessing as a result of that I think is properly reflected in this updated guidance for the organic piece of C&I.
James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. No, that's fair. I'm sorry, what?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yes. There is some contribution of increased telecom outlook in that number as well, but, as you pointed out.
James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then can we just go back to the quarter to get a better sense of the organic assumptions or the organic growth rates broken out by resi and C&I? I mean, we know that residential is the smaller piece for Pramac. Can you provide just a little more detail as to what that breakout might be so we can get a stronger sense of the core growth in the quarter?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: If you're looking for core growth for resi, it's more – I mean, CHP is the biggest piece of that in terms of the acquisition contribution. There is a small amount for Pramac for resi. But if you're looking for just core growth, year-over-year for resi, it was down about 11%. And that is mainly from home standby for the reasons we talked about in terms of the prior-year headwinds with backlog and field inventory.
James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I will get back in queue.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Sure.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Good morning, Brian.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Good morning.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Can you talk a little bit more about the seasonality from first quarter to second quarter? There is just a lot of moving parts here, including CHP, Pramac, just general seasonality in home standby and industrial, the Magnum tower light business. So there is a big step up I think in models in general from first quarter to second quarter, and it would be helpful if you could in any way kind of further quantify those factors.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yes, this is York. I mean getting specifics in terms of quantification, but you are right. We posted $286 million first quarter net sales, and second quarter our prepared remarks talked about $350 million to $360 million. So Pramac, in the first quarter there was only one month of contribution there. So we will have three months in second quarter. So right off the bat there you will get a large sequential increase just by getting a full quarter from Pramac. But beyond that, I mean there is some normal seasonality in our business that Q1 is always the lowest quarter for us in the year and it builds then up throughout the year. And especially – so CHP is where it hasn't quite annualized, but when you look at their business they are a spring and fall business. So you should expect -
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Q2 is definitely their best quarter.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yeah. You should expect a definite increase from Q1 into Q2 as their bigger quarter's in the spring. Even in the mobile business, there is some seasonality where Q1 is just typically your lower quarter. So you build off of that. On the home standby side, same thing. Q1 is typically your lowest quarter, and you build into the year from Q1 into Q3 – I'm sorry, from Q2 into Q3. So it is really, I think what it is highlighting is there is a good amount of seasonality that will explain that sequential increase. And then Aaron highlighted I think in his prepared comments about we are seeing some stronger quoting and order rates on the industrial side, which should support a sequential increase on some of that legacy C&I business from Q1 into Q2.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then I guess one other factor is you had I think some modest pull forward from 1Q into 4Q in the telecom space. Is that another reason why this kind of step from first quarter to second quarter could look amplified?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Yeah. I think it was more of a budget burn situation for some of those customers in Q4, Brian. So coming into Q1 we saw it kind of return to some of the lower levels that were occurring from a CapEx environment standpoint. But again, in our prepared remarks we think that that CapEx spending environment for telecom appears firmer as we go forward. I wouldn't say materially so, but at least it gives us some encouragement that, as we come around the year here, that we would anticipate seeing improvement there.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: It supports an increase obviously...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: It supports an increase certainly off of Q1. And again, I think our remarks on C&I for Q1 to Q2, the improvement we are seeing there, those are real improvements. I mean, that's kind of a backlog business in terms of lead times on products and things. So we have pretty decent visibility into C&I at least for the next quarter. So we feel very comfortable with the kind of increase that we are projecting there. So it definitely feels like the C&I market took a pause in Q1 off on the back of some lower quoting activity in the second half. Kind of that industrial recession maybe that happened in the second half of last year I think put a pause on some of the ordering of that type of equipment. And that seems to have freed up here as we go from Q1 into Q2.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then if I could just ask, you mentioned $4 million to $5 million I believe in savings that you will achieve as an annual run rate by fourth quarter 2016. What do you expect to realize within 2016? And secondly, did restructuring impact first quarter 2016 OpEx?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: So I guess when you annualize – or quarterize that $4 million to $5 million, that is about $1 million a quarter. And we expect that to start in Q4. So that I guess, just quarterize the $4 million to $5 million and that is what we expect to start in Q4. And then in terms of what hit OpEx in Q1 was the question, Brian? I apologize.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. No. Sorry. I am just saying, you said $4 million to $5 million is going to be the run rate you achieve but what amount will you recognize within this fiscal year? It's something less than $4 million or $5 million.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Correct.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: And then I am wondering did we get enough of these restructuring actions complete in this first quarter of 2016 to where it actually impacted the quarter or is it all kind of going to flow through later this year?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yeah. The most – the vast majority of the actions were implemented here in the first quarter and that's part of the $7.1 million restructuring and optimization charge. There may be a small amount that maybe gets announced in future quarters but the vast majority is here in Q1.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning, guys.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Good morning, Ross.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Good morning.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I am just trying to understand what the real message is just sort of on the current environment for standby, on one hand, core growth is down 11% but you are talking about activations. I wasn't really clear on what you are saying about field inventories there, so can you just flesh that out a little bit more? Is the overall environment getting better or worse?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Yeah, it's a great question and one that is a bit – there is a lot of moving pieces in that, too, just looking at the quarter. But we look at – so we look at a couple of things, Ross, as you know. We look at kind of end user demand for us, we have real-time activation data so every machine that's installed we know exactly where it's installed and when it gets turned on for the first time. So we believe that gives us very good insight into what's going on in the end market. We saw activations year over year in the quarter were up and we think that that's primarily related to a milder winter, so more of those machines were able to get put in, and also power outage severity was – there was a little more in terms of outages in the quarter. Now, nothing relative to where we have been historically but over this kind of trough period over the last three years, it was kind of in line with that. So a little bit up from the really super-low levels from last year, so we think those two things – a milder winter and a little bit more power outage activity – drove activations higher. I think where the 11% decrease in the shipments comes from is the fact that when you wind the clock back and you look at how we came into Q1 of 2015, we were coming off of a Q4 in 2014 that was a very strong quarter in terms of activation rates. And so what it led to is there was actually a bit of backlog – quite a bit of backlog coming into 2015 that was satisfied. Those shipments were made in the first quarter of 2015, and we didn't have that same situation repeat here. So that is the backlog piece of that. Field inventories also coming into 2015 then, because of the backlog, were lower at the beginning of 2015, and we had higher field inventories, for lack of a better term, in the first quarter of 2016 on a like-for-like basis. So when you kind of wash all that out, that is the 11%. I think what we look at – again, we watch this activation data very closely and the power outage data, of course – we like the trends. Kind of as we ended the quarter here, field inventories were very much in line with where we were last year, but because of the higher activation rate in the first quarter, we are actually seeing those inventories turn a little faster. So we like that as kind of a – in terms of how that translates to market sentiment, in terms of buying for Q2, and that's really the inverse of what happened in Q2 last year. So we were coming out of the first quarter last year, activation rates were actually slowing in the back half of that first quarter. So the buying mood turned decidedly negative in Q2 on us last year. So our promotions and other normal things that we would do in Q2, we just didn't get a lot of uptake in that in Q2 last year. We don't believe that that same situation is going to happen this year, and we are appropriately reflecting that in our guidance.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Could you just explain the significance of the activation? My understanding is, at the time of the activation, you've already recognized the revenue from shipping to the dealer. Is the significance of the activation that that essentially moves that product out of dealer inventory?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Correct. Correct, that's exactly what happened. So by the very nature of our shipments to distribution, we know how much inventory, if you will, is in the field very precisely up to the point when it is activated, and then effectively, as you are saying, it comes out of field inventory at that point.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Can you guys also just talk about the year-on-year increase in receivables and inventory? I think you mentioned that Pramac added $50 million of working capital, but I think even if you stripped that out you would be up, and maybe Country Home Products is contributing to that, too, but any help there.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yes. So I'll help you out there, Ross. So the Pramac opening balance sheet for AR will have about $56 million. So that then organically we'll have a decline in AR. Inventories was about $40 million inventory balance coming on from Pramac. So that would show an increase in inventories, and the highlight there is we were doing some strategic volume engine buys here in the first quarter, and that was the main driver for the organic increase in inventory. So that maybe helps you out a little bit more.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you. And your operating expenses were a little bit higher, tied to these acquisitions. I imagine there is – part of the rationale in doing the Pramac deal is that you take out some SG&A. So how quickly do you think you can get that SG&A associated with that transaction down to more like Generac ratios?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Yes. There's two things there, Ross. First, on the Pramac side, actually most of the synergies that we are looking at are going to come on the COGS side, in the cost of goods sold. So optimization of the manufacturing footprint, and then most of the synergies that we are targeting are going to come out of the combination of the global supply chains of the two businesses. On the SG&A side, their cost-to-serve as a global business with 14 branches worldwide, four plants worldwide, is a bit higher than what you would see for us. I mean, we have a fairly simple operating structure in North America here with core Generac in comparison. So there may be some opportunities as it relates to combinations with our Tower Light business over there. There might be some SG&A, but to be frank we are not putting a lot of math behind that. I think we are hoping to leverage that SG&A. We don't think it's going to grow a lot more in terms of raw dollars. We just think we're going to be able to leverage it as we work on the revenue synergy side of that, and then again the savings are going to come out of COGS. And then the second piece on the overall SG&A is the Country Home Products business, as a primarily direct-to-consumer business they have very good gross margins but then there is a high cost to serve as a result of that direct-to-consumer model. So there is no distribution channel. So the "costs" that would normally be borne by distribution are borne by, in this case, CHP directly, and that's reflected in the higher SG&A load as a percentage of sales.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.
Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Good morning, Charley.
Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: On the $7.1 million optimization restructuring, I just wanted to understand that a little bit better. Can you remind me, you mentioned it but I missed it, when you are going to consolidate that plant, the Bismarck plant?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yeah, the Bismarck plant should, by the end of July, should be completed. So we announced that in the first quarter, and we are in the process of that transition as we speak. It should be completed by July.
Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Is the head count reduction piece of the restructuring completed?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: It's substantially completed at this point. There is a few – I mean, as we wind down the facility there is a few more heads there. And then there are some heads within the mobile business in totality, the broader business there, that we are continuing to work through here in the second quarter.
Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And on the asset write-down, was all of that from MAC, and can you quantify that?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yeah. The vast majority was – we haven't provided the specific details on that, but the vast majority was on the MAC side. As you transition the inventory over from one plant to another, there is some inventory you just don't want to move. So there were some write-downs related to that. Most of that, you are correct, is inventory related to MAC.
Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then I guess I don't know if I missed the answer or not, but on a prior question about the $4 million to $5 million that you had a run rate by Q4, I guess what I am trying to get to really, what's the run rate for Q2 and Q3 and the rest of the year? Obviously, as he said earlier, you're not going to get the full $4 million to $5 million until you're done with everything. But there is some percentage of that that you are going to get a piece of prior to the end of Q4.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yeah. That's fair. That is fair. However, the building is still there, so you are not going to get everything. But as volume comes down, you're going to get those savings. But to your point, Charley, there are some savings that get realized here in Q2 and Q3 as we are transitioning the MAC business into the Berlin location.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: But the biggest driver of the cost is the closure of the facility and the head count reduction. So Q3, although it won't happen until the end of July, so you are already into Q3, you will see a significant part of that quarterized version of that $4 million to $5 million. I don't know that it is quite $1 million at that point because you only have two months, but by the fourth quarter we will be pretty close to run rating that.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yes.
Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Is that facility owned right now or leased?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: It is an owned facility.
Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. So at some point presumably you're going to put it up for sale and there will be a gain or something on that at some point.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: At some point. We will evaluate after we get out of it just kind of what we want to do. It is an older facility. So to be frank, the value, both on the books and from a market standpoint, is pretty minimal. So I wouldn't expect any massive gains from that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Good morning, Jerry.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Aaron, can you talk about how the supply chain review is going at Pramac? I think you had mentioned a 90-day period that was a key milestone for where you folks would do – it would be fairly reasonably far along in terms of evaluating how the supply chain fits within the broader Generac purchase organization. And can you just give us an update how that review is going and what the cost-saving opportunity looks like today versus compared to when we last spoke on last quarter's call?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Yeah. I think obviously it's a major area of focus for us, Jerry, given that we think that a lot of the opportunity in combining these businesses is in supply chain. It's front and center in the integration activities, so we're kind of call it maybe halfway through that process, 60 days into the 90 days that we've called out. What we're finding is that there is a lot of moving pieces, as you know, as you could expect with factories all over the world now trying to figure out just the optimized logistics spots of the supply base from one plant to another – from their plants, from the suppliers' plants, to our plants. So that's actually playing a bigger role in some of this analysis. And then, as it relates to things like Brazil, you've got imports, duties and other things that you have to put into consideration. So not dodging the question, but it's turned into a pretty elaborate exercise. I think the biggest piece would be engine supply on the diesel engine side and our alternator supply for the facilities outside the U.S. where we don't manufacture our own alternators in particular and we have suppliers that do that for us. Those two pieces of the supply chain are the pieces that we are evaluating first and foremost because they represent the largest spend items. And we are knee-deep in the evaluation process. So we've sent out – frankly these are big RFP processes that are currently underway. And we've got teams, both combined with Pramac and Generac people and also with our Tower Light folks. We're dealing with the stationary side of the business first, and then we will move to our mobile business later because in many parts of the world, specifically here in North America as it relates to engines, anyway, you've got a different emissions requirement for mobile products versus stationary products. So that enters another variable into the analysis. So there is a lot of pieces here. We hope to have I think some more information around being able to quantify the savings. But right now we're still very encouraged by what we're seeing. And as we talk to the supply chain partners, we think that partnering with Generac for many of these suppliers gives them just a wonderful opportunity to access the global power generation market in a way that they couldn't before with a single customer. And I think that a customer who has not only the footprint to serve but also the technical capabilities to work with these partners to make sure that we've got the right products and the right applications. So we're evaluating it and we're going through the process, but it's going to be a big project.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And Aaron, when do you expect to be done with the RFP process and to give us a sense for what the cost structure looks like? How should we be thinking about that?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Yeah, I mean we're hoping to get most of that work done – leg work done here in the second quarter, Jerry. And so from our standpoint, our original target date was to try and get it all done by June. It might be more towards the back half of June or July. Then we have to notify suppliers. And then the fact of the matter is, the realization of the savings is going to take longer because many of the changes, whenever you're changing anything within the major – the power head configuration of a product, either the engine or alternator or both, there is design work to be done there. So in some cases it may be easy because it might be a supplier that we're already using that we're just going to realize a better pricing structure on or better delivery or some other improved set of terms. But in a lot of cases it may mean changes to the product lines, and those changes are going to need engineering resources to get done. So the true realization of a lot of these changes and a lot of these savings really won't come until 2017. And I think we were consistent on that when we called this out early on, but we have said that we really won't see much of this until next year.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you for the color. And then for the residential standby business, can you talk about how in-home consultations are tracking? I guess normal seasonality is for residential standby sales to be up 10% to 15% sequentially 2Q versus 1Q. I'm wondering if the in-home consultations are supportive of that normal seasonal ramp.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: They are. They look – right now they are somewhat flattish in terms of IHCs as it relates to the prior year. But everything that – as we look at it, I think the one underlying difference when I look at IHCs, our close rate has actually improved a bit. We continue to focus on training, not only from a sales standpoint but also just from a quality of lead standpoint. I think one of the really interesting things that we are finding right now and we're kind of in the early innings of it, but the Country Home Products acquisition for us was – included within that company is a really good direct-to-consumer marketing entity. They buy their own media. They produce a lot of their own media. They have an eye towards consumer interaction and how to maximize consumer interaction. We always talk about the sales funnel here. They really helped us kind of open up our eyes a bit to just how wide the funnel can be and how much more can go in that funnel based on certain techniques that they have done and have used over the years. In particular, as it relates to some of their larger-ticket items, when you go after one of their walk-behind brush cutters, you're talking about a $3,000, $4,000 machine. So it is not so dissimilar from what we are talking about with a home standby generator. And so I think their experiences are pretty applicable here. And what we are just kicking off now is we have got some things in test around IHCs where they are actually doing the in-home – they are not doing the in-home consultations but they are driving the leads for the in-home consultations. And so that is a new twist for us, and we are excited about some of the early returns on that and looking to expand and ramp that up here in Q2 as we go into the season. So between that and the improving close rate underlying IHCs, those two things are things that give us the kind of confidence that I think is framed around our guidance here for the balance of the year with residential.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Good morning.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): So Pramac certainly has a totally different scale relative to your prior acquisitions, if I am not mistaken. So congratulations on that step. And just wondering in terms of integration if that raises any interesting questions on the cultural integration side, and I know you already have some Italian blood going there with Tower Light, if I am not mistaken.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Correct. No, that is a good question, Chris. I think there are two things that I'd point to. Clearly, just from the outside looking in, it is our biggest transaction to-date by a high percentage. It is a complex organization in terms of 14 sales branches, four manufacturing plants, 600 people. It is a global organization, which presents its own unique challenges with integration of systems, just within Pramac itself. So from the outside looking in, it's clearly a tough challenge. So there is two things I would point to, though, and what we have tried to do to mitigate the challenge that exists there in integration. The first is we don't own 100%. I think it is really important from an alignment standpoint, the founding family of this business is remaining a significant owner. And so they are a great partner for us. They are people that I have known for quite a long time in our industry – seven years, eight years and have worked with them on a number of things. And we have a very good relationship in terms of very open, very frank discussion about where we think we can grow, about some of these supply chain discussions that I have talked about this morning. That notwithstanding, I think their complete alignment with us in terms of the performance of the business is an important element of taking, de-risking some of the what I would call kind of the overarching integration issues or performance issues, anyway, with the business that could exist. Secondarily, we took a very seasoned person from our team here – our management team here, and we actually have deployed him within Pramac's walls in Siena in their headquarters to help really as an integration lead. We have never done that before. We have never really kind of, I would say, helicoptered somebody into an acquisition solely for the purposes of being an integration lead in that fashion. And it is somebody with a supply chain background, which is, again, where we think we have the biggest opportunity. This also happens to be an individual who speaks Italian. So that does help in terms of some of the language barriers. But as you mentioned, we have already a pretty good presence in Italy with the Tower Light acquisition. That also is helpful here in mitigating some of the risks of integration, not only because of our familiarity with some of the cultural things that go on in Italy but basically we have got a team on the ground just two hours north of Siena. So that team has already been very helpful and particularly on the finance side. As we just do our normal process of consolidating financials, that team has been very helpful with helping the Pramac team kind of navigate our process there and they are on the ground and very hands-on. So we feel good about it. It is not that there is no risk to it. It is certainly, as you pointed out, there definitely are some risks. But we think we have taken the appropriate measures and actions to mitigate that.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And can you remind the percent you have?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: We own about 65% of the company.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And sticking with bookkeeping for a second, the comment on Q2 EBITDA was for the margin rate to mirror the first quarter. Is that right?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Correct. That was our prepared comments. Correct.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then on the resi standby with sales down, activations up, field inventories, the clear plugs, so this dynamic seems to be a couple times a year variant that kind of plays with the "normal seasonality." Is that something you see ironing out as your channel matures over time or just something that we can expect updates on fairly regularly?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Chris, this is York. I think Q1 of 2015 there was a number of unique things going on, and that is when we really started having these discussions about field inventory and backlog. And it was all exacerbated by the fact that Q4 of 2014 was very strong, and then in Q1 part of the end market softened pretty fast and, as a result, that field inventory really increased in Q1 more so than ever. And then we also talked about that the other extra piece to that is the backlog was high coming into 2015 because of the strong market conditions in Q4 2014. So those two things together caused Q1 of 2015, the prior-year Q1 quarter, just to be elevated. And so therefore you flash forward to this quarter and we have some tough comps as a result. So I think that period there of very strong record activations in Q4 of 2014 is really what caused a lot of this.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: I think I would add to that, too, Chris, that you know every quarter that goes by we get a little smarter in terms of the value of the information that we compile internally with activation and field inventory. As I said before, we actually have a pretty clear picture on those two pieces. And I think, you know, based on that and we know – obviously, we know what backlog is and when it does exist as it did when we came into Q1 of 2015. So I think as the situation plays out, as the channel matures, as different things occur that could move those pieces, we will give updates accordingly. And I think in my mind, those updates have become clearer from our standpoint because we have continued to kind of mature the way that we look at the business and the way we understand the things that kind of trigger moves up or down, either in end demand or in the field inventory levels and their impact on current run rates. So while we do not have a ton of visibility to the future in that business and obviously you could get a power outage tomorrow and that thing could take off like a rocketship and that is kind of what we have been saying is that to go three years like this without outages and still have the kind of end demand that we have today, we are actually very pleased with that. And I won't say we are surprised by the strength of it, but in some respects we look at kind of some of the regions around the country that we continue to see strength in activations and end demand in the West and the southern parts of the country, and you know it's very encouraging for us that when the kind of normalized outage environment, we keep referring to that, it hasn't happened for a long time. So it is difficult to say that. But it will happen again and when that does happen, and we've never really pressure-tested all the new stuff we put in. So with PowerPlay and with our PowerPro dealer programs, all the talk around IHCs, those are all things that were post kind of the last elevated period of outage activity. So how those things play out into the future will be interesting to see, both I'm sure not only from our standpoint but from yours as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy from Canaccord. Your line is open.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for fitting me in. Two quick questions.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Hi, John.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: How are you, York? I'm sorry if these are remedial here. First, on the telecom trends, I think you guys said they are firming up. What sort of evidence do you have for that or what gives you some conviction in there, if that is the right assumption? And then secondly, how is the early sell-in season look for CHP? Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Yes. So on the issue of telecom, you know, John, I think for us we are just, again, I think it was a pretty poor year in 2015 in terms of the CapEx spending environment and it goes in cycles. So what we look at is obviously the discussions we are having with the customers in that channel have, I would say, have been decidedly more positive year-over-year in terms of their planning around projects. And so as they plan for projects, that doesn't necessarily mean it has materialized into orders, and it doesn't necessarily mean that they will spend those dollars. But the budgets – it appears to us that the budgets that they have set aside for purchases are greater this year than they were last year. So that's a big part of it I think in terms of just how we feel about the overall as it relates to telecom specifically. I don't – we are not saying it is going to be materially up year-over-year, but we just feel like it's a firmer environment in general and based on the kind of discussion. And then as far as sell-in on the CHP, that side of that question, because it is primarily a D&C business there is not a tremendous amount of sell into a channel, right. So I mean this 80% of what they do, more than 80% of what they do is direct-to-consumer. So a lot of that is transacted real-time and so – in fact, we are – it is pretty amazing actually how quickly they see changes in buying habits for end consumers. You know they – we don't have to wait for something to work through the channel. We don't have this discussion of field inventory and all these other things like we have in our core business. They actually see real-time kind of phone traffic and web traffic. It's really kind of real end demand, and it is real time, so kind of an interesting business that way. We have not had a direct-to-consumer channel before that we have been associated with, and this has been kind of interesting to watch how even simple things like moves in the stock market day to day have impacts on just how consumers feel about their household wealth and then what that translates into in terms of buying patterns on a day-to-day basis, week-to-week basis. So it is pretty interesting.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. So there is no like precedent with your big-box relationships? I know obviously that is one step to the consumer, but I guess the broader question, Aaron, was just based on where we are with weather and economy and your comment about stock prices,..
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Yeah.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: ...order trends shaping up like you thought they would have or – I know it is a smaller piece, but...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: Yes. So not a lot of retail channel there, so that is what I was referring to. But in terms of just kind of order trends or call it consumer sentiment around those types of products, housing remains very strong. And so new construction has been a bullish segment of the economy here and that obviously is good for all those types of products. And Q2 is kind of the peak season for this business, as we said, in terms of seasonality, and we believe that is going to play out. CHP had a nice first quarter for us. We like the trends. It is up year over year in terms of on a – even though we haven't annualized the acquisition yet, in terms of just looking at them, kind of their results year over year. They like the trends. They think the consumer feels pretty – is on solid footing with energy prices lower, housing up. Even though the stock market is – you can pick your number on where you think the market is going to end, but right now they feel very good about the consumer trends. As I said, I think the one thing that is interesting about this business is changes can happen pretty quickly in that end demand because of the direct nature of the channel. So it is kind of interesting to kind of watch the kind of pure consumer reaction as we go week to week in terms of order patterns. Weather does impact that as well. It has been a pretty decent spring so far around the country, and that also helps those types of products. So those are all positive factors as we go into Q2.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: You bet.
Operator: Thank you very much for that question. I am showing there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jagdfeld. Thank you.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - Executive Chairman, President & CEO: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning, and we look forward to our second quarter 2016 earnings release, which we anticipate will be issued sometime in late July. With that, we will conclude our call. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our overall financial performance for the fourth quarter exceeded our most recent guidance expectations, with net sales and margins continuing the strong seasonal performance experienced during the second half of 2015. Despite the persistent very low power outage environment in the quarter, higher-than-expected shipments of residential products improved organically on a sequential basis and helped to largely offset additional weakness within our Commercial & Industrial products, driven by lower-than-expected shipments of mobile products as a result of the further weakening in energy prices. Also, shipments to telecom national account customers were higher than expected due to some year-end budget-related spending. We generated a record level of free cash flow during the quarter of $101 million which was largely due to a significant reduction in inventory levels and the monetization of receivables. We also remained active with our share repurchase program as we increased our total repurchases to $100 million for the entire second half of 2015. On a year-over-year basis, net sales in the fourth quarter were $358 million as compared to $404 million in the prior year as we faced strong comparisons for both residential and Commercial & Industrial products. The power outage severity environment remained very low during the quarter but was consistent with our previous guidance. As a result, activations of home standby generators declined on a year-over-year basis, resulting in a corresponding decline in shipments of these products to our customers. However, activations improved during the quarter at a healthy rate on a sequential basis as a result of the effectiveness of our sales, marketing and promotional programs. Shipments of portable generators increased on an organic basis as compared to the prior-year quarter due to cross-selling synergies from the Powermate acquisition, the recent launch of our new iQ2000 inverter generator and some incremental demand driven by potential outage threats during the current quarter. Regarding our C&I products, the significant decline in energy prices that persisted throughout 2015 continues to have a worse-than-expected impact on capital spending for our mobile products. Rental customers have been actively repositioning their underutilized equipment from oil and gas-related applications to other rental opportunities. This is resulting in a deferral of new equipment spending and playing a major role in the decline in the overall demand for mobile equipment. Recall that starting in the second quarter of 2014 we experienced a significant increase in demand for mobile equipment used in the oil and gas sector with this strength peaking through the fourth quarter of the prior year, creating a very challenging year-over-year comparison for our C&I products during the current quarter. We remain optimistic on the long-term opportunity related to domestic energy production and the need for mobile products that are essential to these activities. However, the adverse impacts from the severe drop in energy prices throughout the year and the additional leg down and volatility in oil prices experienced thus far in 2016 continue to have a negative impact on industry fleet purchases. Accordingly, we are taking what we believe to be a cautious approach to our 2016 outlook for shipments in mobile products as we evaluate the further impact of lower energy prices on the demand for capital equipment. Before discussing additional fourth quarter details and our outlook for 2016, I want to share with you several important accomplishments from 2015, as well as provide some added color on the Pramac acquisition that we announced yesterday. We executed on a number of initiatives throughout 2015 involving our legacy residential products, in particular within the home standby generator category, but also with portable generators. As mentioned previously, overall power outage severity declined significantly when compared to the prior year as there were no major outage events for the third consecutive year and the baseline level of outage activity also continued to decline. Despite this very challenging backdrop, shipments of portable generators were only modestly lower on an organic basis for the full year. This outperformance was encouraging to see as we fully integrated the Powermate product line and launched our new iQ2000 inventor generator during the second half of the year. We remain focused on building out and enhancing our leading share position within the portable generator market, which we now estimate to be in the high 20% range and we entered the year with our broadest lineup ever and with retail placement of these products currently at an all-time high. The significant decline in outages also led to a further reduction in shipments of home standby generators for the year. However, as the clear market leader, we believe we had a notable influence on the end user demand for these products in 2015 as we continue to make investments in our innovative sales and targeted marketing programs to increase the awareness of the category. These investments continue to pay off in our efforts to grow the category as in-home consultations or IHCs increased at a strong rate over 2014 despite the challenging end market dynamics for home standby generators. We also maintained our intense focus on new product introductions and efforts to develop distribution throughout the year. As a result, the year-over-year decline in activations and shipments of standby generators were much better relative to the overall decline in power outage severity. Although the category experienced a very robust growth period following several major outage events in 2011 and 2012, residential product shipments have declined in each of the past two years. Despite this decline, we believe demand for our home standby and portable generators has remained relatively resilient. In fact, the current baseline level of demand for these products is still much higher relative to the prior baseline period of lower outages which occurred back in 2010, with shipments growing organically at an approximately 12% compounded annual rate over the past five years. We believe this growth is evidence of the penetration opportunity that exists for home standby generators and emergency backup power in general. While the power outage environment is obviously beyond our control, when market conditions inevitably improve, we believe we are well positioned to fully leverage the innovative sales and marketing programs for home standby generators, which were largely only implemented within the last three years. In the meantime, we will continue to focus on a variety of strategic initiatives to increase the awareness, availability and affordability of home standby generators. These initiatives include specific projects and activities targeted towards generating more sales leads, improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of the home standby system. Innovation has always been a core value of Generac and remains an important element of our future growth. During 2015, we introduced a number of new products while continuing to build on a substantial portfolio of future development initiatives. An important residential product introduction was the new iQ2000 inverter generator, the quietest, most intelligent portable generator on the market. As the only inverter generator built in U.S., the iQ2000 includes state-of-the-art sound mitigation technology coupled with advanced electronics that greatly reduces noise while also improving fuel economy and ease of operation. We also introduced several new C&I products during the year, including a number of stationary and mobile natural gas generators that further expand our broad gas product range. We began shipping our new 400-kilowatt power node earlier in the year at an industry-leading price point. And toward the end of the year, we announced a new 500-kilowatt natural gas generator, the largest gas unit in our industrial generator line. Both of these units are ideal for large standby power applications such as office buildings, mission critical data centers and healthcare facilities. Recently, we also introduced the new MGG450 mobile generator that operates on natural gas, wellhead gas or liquid propane and offers superior power density making it ideal for powering large equipment under continuous operation in remote field locations. We believe our ability to innovate is something that separates us from competitors in our industry, and we will continue our significant investment and focus on new product development as we work on a substantial pipeline of product launches across our business. We also made further progress during the year in building out and expanding our capabilities for larger industrial generators, an area we have been focused on since acquiring the Baldor Generator business in late 2013. This includes a significant expansion of our product line to include a broader, more competitive offering of larger output systems, as we all as improving our distribution capabilities to better enable our industrial distributors to sell these more complex products. As a result of these efforts, shipments of larger output diesel generators increased at an encouraging rate during 2015. We also continue to experience growth for our industrial gas generators during the year as we further leverage our core competencies with natural gas engines. In addition, overall shipments through our domestic C&I distributors increased year-over-year despite the overall softness in the bid-spec construction market for industrial gensets. This outperformance gives us confidence that we are executing on a key portion of our Powering Ahead strategy of gaining industrial market share. Heading into 2016, we remain committed to a number of important initiatives to further gain share in the larger end of the power generation market. This includes leveraging the recent introductions of new natural gas generator products, the continued optimization of our industrial dealer network, and targeting and improvement in the specification and closure rates for C&I products. Regarding M&A activity, we continue to remain active throughout the year evaluating strategic acquisitions. In early August, we acquired Country Home Products which was founded in 1985 and employs over 200 people at its facilities located in Vermont. Country Home Products is a leading manufacturer of high-quality, professional-grade engine-powered equipment sold primarily under the DR brand and used in a wide variety of property maintenance tasks. The company's broad product line of chore-related engine power tools are largely sold in North America through catalogs, outdoor power equipment dealers and select regional retailers and include field and brush mowers, chippers and shredders, trimmers, leaf vacuums, stump grinders and log splitters. We're excited about the potential cross-selling opportunities for these products to our existing distribution along with gaining valuable expertise to help us further refine our targeted consumer marketing skills to continue to broaden the appeal of home standby generators. This acquisition also provides additional scale to our existing platform of engine-powered products, allowing us to target certain class synergies as we leverage our global sourcing and manufacturing capabilities. Lastly, as announced yesterday, we entered into an agreement to acquire a majority ownership interest in PR industrial S.r.l and its subsidiaries collectively known as Pramac, which was founded in 1966 and is headquartered in Siena, Italy. Pramac is a leading global manufacturer of stationary and mobile generators which provide continuous, prime and backup power for a variety of commercial and industrial applications under the Pramac brand name, as well as portable generators used for numerous residential, light construction and recreational purposes. The company also produces a line of manual and electric material handling equipment marketed under the Lifter brand. These products are sold into over 150 countries worldwide through a broad distribution network. Pramac employs over 600 people across its four manufacturing plants and 14 commercial branches which are located across the globe. The addition of Pramac, our large acquisition to-date, built significantly upon the transactions we've completed over the past six years that have worked to transform Generac from a North American-focused power generation-only company into a global power products company. The acquisition of Pramac aligns directly with the key element of our Powering Ahead strategic plan of expanding our geographic footprint and revenue base internationally, essentially doubling our international sales mix outside the U.S. and Canada and elevating us to a major player in the global power generation market. We believe this transaction will create global cross-selling opportunities, including selling Pramac stationary, mobile, and portable generators through Generac's existing international distribution channels while also selling Generac national gas generators and our broad array of mobile equipment into Pramac distribution. With the combined scale of the two companies, we believe we can achieve meaningful cost synergies as we leverage our global sourcing opportunities and manufacturing footprint. The acquisition is anticipated to close before the end of the first quarter of 2016. I'd now like to turn the call back over to York to discuss fourth quarter results in more detail. York?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $357.8 million as compared to $404 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Sequentially, net sales in the current quarter were approximately flat as compared to $359.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, continuing our seasonally strong performance. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales during the fourth quarter of 2015 increased to $198.5 million as compared to $194.9 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from the Country Home Products acquisition and, to a lesser extent, an increase in shipments of portable generators were mostly offset by a decline in shipments of home standby generators. On an organic basis, residential product sales declined approximately 5% compared to prior year. The softness in home standby shipments was primarily driven by very low levels of power outage severity during the current year. Also, recall that prior year fourth quarter saw record levels of activation rates as a result of the two-year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, homeowners being more proactive after the polar vortex winter in the previous year, and heightened levels of localized outage activity within the Midwest and Canada during 2014. However, as Aaron mentioned, shipments of home standby generators did outperform our expectations in the quarter as home standby installation activity remained strong and improved sequentially from the third quarter. Lastly, shipments of portable generators increased modestly during the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year due to cross-selling synergies achieved from the Powermate acquisition, new product introductions and some incremental demand driven by potential outage threats. Looking at our Commercial & Industrial products, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $131.9 million as compared to $185 million for the comparable period in 2014. The decline was primarily due to a significant decline in shipments of mobile products into oil and gas and general rental markets as a result of lower capital spending caused by the substantial decline in energy prices. To a lesser extent, shipments of C&I products were also impacted by declines in Latin America as a result of continued softness in infrastructure spending in those markets. The negative impact of foreign currency on C&I product sales was only approximately 2% during the quarter. Net sales for the Other products category were $27.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $24.1 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of aftermarket product sales from the recent Country Home Products acquisition and, to a lesser extent, additional service part sales resulting from our growing base of stationary and mobile products in the market. Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 36.6% compared to 34.3% in the prior year fourth quarter. This strong increase was driven by a variety of factors including the following: a favorable product mix given the higher sales mix of residential products in the current year quarter; the impact from the Country Home Products acquisition, which had a higher gross margin profile on average; the favorable impact of lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar; and finally, gross margin in the prior year was negatively impacted by temporary increases in certain costs associated with the West Coast port congestion as well as other overhead-related costs that did not repeat in the current year quarter. The fourth quarter of 2015 includes the impact of $40.7 million of pre-tax, non-cash charges for the impairment of certain intangible assets. Nearly, all of this charge relates to the impairment of tradenames totaling $36.1 million as a result of a new branding strategy to transition and consolidate various brands acquired through acquisitions over the past several years to the Generac tradename. As a result, we have reclassified these tradenames as definite-lived intangibles for accounting purposes and will amortize their remaining book value over a two-year period. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased $44.5 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, which includes the impact of the aforementioned $40.7 million of intangible impairment charges. Excluding the impacts of these charges, operating expenses for the quarter increased $3.8 million or 6.5% as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with the Country Home Products acquisition, partially offset by reductions in certain organic selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets and the intangible impairment charges, was 15.9% for the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 13.4% in the prior year period. The result of Country Home Products, higher OpEx infrastructure and the reduced leverage of fixed SG&A costs on a lower organic sales base. Adjusted EBITDA was $80.1 million or 22.4% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $92.2 million or 22.8% of net sales in the same period last year. The slight decline of adjusted EBITDA margins compared to prior year was primarily attributable to the 250 basis point increase in operating expense as a percent of net sales, partially offset by the improvement in gross margin as a result of the factors just discussed. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2015 was $270.8 million or 20.6% of sales. We were encouraged to see the strong seasonal increase in profitability develop during the second half of 2015 as adjusted EBITDA margins improved 420 basis points as compared to the first half. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $9.2 million as compared to $49.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The current year net income includes the impact of the $40.7 million pre-tax non-cash intangible impairment charge as previously discussed. GAAP income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2015 were $6.4 million or a 41% tax rate as compared to $17.5 million or a 26.1% tax rate for the prior year. The increase in GAAP tax rate in the current year fourth quarter was primarily due to the beneficial impact from certain one-time large state R&D tax credits that were recognized in the prior year fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a portion of the intangible impairment charge recorded in the current year. Adjusted net income as defined in our earnings release was $65.3 million in the current year quarter versus $68.4 million in the prior year. This decline over the prior year is primarily the result of the overall decline in operating earnings as previous discussed, partially offset by $6.7 million in lower cash income taxes. With regards to cash income taxes, the fourth quarter of 2015 includes the impact of a small cash income tax benefit of $450,000, as compared to a cash income tax expense of $6.3 million in the prior year quarter. This year-over-year decline in cash income taxes for the quarter was primarily the result of a lower cash income tax rate for the full year 2015 of 4.9%, as compared to the full year 2014 rate of 13.3%. In the first half of 2015, we are recognizing cash taxes at a higher rate than what ultimately played out. That is the reason for the small benefit reflected in Q4. The significant decline in the cash income tax rate as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the year-over-year decline in pre-tax earnings. Pre-tax earnings in 2015 were almost completely shielded by the intangible amortization tax shield that is included in our tax return, resulting in a very low cash tax rate in the current year. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $101.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $98.5 million in the same period last year. This record level of free cash flow was a direct result of our efforts to bring working capital levels down in line with demand. As a result of this focus, we were able to monetize approximately $50 million of working capital during the quarter. Free cash flow for the full year 2015 was $158 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of $1.06 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortizated original issue discount and $115.9 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $942.5 million. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 was 3.5 times on an as-reported basis. Additionally, at the end of 2015, there was approximately $149 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. As already mentioned, we repurchased 1.15 million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter for $35.6 million under our share repurchase program which was announced in August 2015. The program authorized the company repurchase up to 200 million of common stock over a 24-month period. Our uses of cash during 2015 included $30.7 million of capital expenditures, $73.8 million related to acquisitions, $50 million for the prepayment of term loan debt and approximately $100 million for stock repurchases. We believe these investments to be a very attractive use of capital for shareholders and demonstrates our confidence in the long-term growth prospects and strong free cash flow generation capabilities of our business. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide comments on our outlook for 2016.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, York. Today, we're initiating guidance for full year 2016 as we expect net sales to increase between 10% to 12% as compared to the prior year, which assumes the contributions from the Pramac acquisition that is anticipated to close before the end of the first quarter. Importantly, this top line outlook assumes no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment and no improvement in power outage severity relative to the very low levels experienced during 2015. We expect the seasonality of quarterly results to demonstrate a normal historical pattern assuming no major outage events occur during the year. As a result, we expect the first half of the year to represent approximately 44% to 46% of total sales and the second half approximately 54% to 56%. Specifically, we anticipate that the first quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter of the year and to be in a range of $270 million to $280 million as we expect that normal seasonality and a notable year-over-year decline in shipments into the oil and gas markets will have an impact in the first quarter of 2016. Looking at our guidance by product class, for residential products, we expect net sales to increase in the low-teens range during 2016, which assumes approximately flat year-over-year organic growth with the balance of growth attributed to the Country Home Products acquisition and, to a lesser degree, some residential product sales from the Pramac acquisition. This sales guidance is driven by a number of factors including the assumption that power outage severity does not improve during 2015. We expect to at least partially offset this impact through our execution on a number of strategic initiatives to increase the awareness and demand for home standby generators, along with some expected continuing benefit from an overall favorable environment for residential investment. The strategic initiatives we are working on include specific projects and activities targeted towards generating more sales leads, improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of a home standby system. In addition, we anticipate residential products will benefit in 2016 from increased retail shelf placement of products, the full-year impact of new product launches and the continued development of our dealer base, including increased participation in various programs such as PowerPlay and Power Pro among others. As a reminder, should the baseline power outage environment normalize relative to the very low levels experienced in 2015 or if there is a major outage event in 2016, it is likely we could exceed these expectations. With regards to our Commercial & Industrial products for the year, we expect net sales to increase approximately 10% on an as-reported basis, which includes the benefit of C&I products acquired in the Pramac transaction. Organic net sales are expected to decline in the low-teens range, which includes an expected negative impact from foreign currency of approximately 1%. The organic decline in net sales is primarily due to continued strong headwinds impacting shipments of mobile products into oil and gas and general rental customers as these markets continue to search for a bottom during 2016. To a lesser extent, the organic decline is also attributed to our expectation of lower sales with certain national account customers, primarily related to our assumption that the telecom capital spending environment remains subdued throughout 2016, particularly during the first half of the year. Modestly offsetting these headwinds is the expectation for our organic international business to grow and shipments into our industrial distribution channel to improve as we make further progress on our efforts to gain share in the larger end of the power generation market. In summarizing our consolidated sales growth assumptions for 2016, we expect total core organic growth on a constant currency basis to be down between 5% to 7% compared to the prior year with only a minimal negative impact from foreign currency. As discussed, nearly all of the organic sales decline is expected to be from ongoing weakness in mobile product shipments into the oil and gas and general rental markets. Excluding the impacts of these specific markets, organic sales are expected to be roughly flat. The acquisitions of Country Home Products and Pramac are expected to contribute approximately 17% growth for a total year-over-year net sales increase between 10% and 12%. Gross margins for 2016 are expected to improve by approximately 175 basis points to 200 basis points as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to a notable reduction in product cost given the expected benefit from lower commodities, sourcing benefits from a strong U.S. dollar and other cost reduction efforts. To a lesser extent, also contributing to the improvement in gross margins are an improved product mix including the full year impact of the Country Home Products acquisition. Partially offsetting these favorable benefits is the mix impact of the Pramac acquisition's largely industrial product offering. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding amortization of intangibles are expected to increase approximately 250 basis points as compared to 2015. This increase is due to the addition of recurring operating expenses from Country Home Products and Pramac acquisition, along with the reduced leverage of fixed selling, general and administrative costs on the anticipated lower organic sales base. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 20% for 2016 with some variation throughout the year as a result of normal seasonality. Similar to the seasonal pattern experienced in the prior year, second half 2016 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 400 basis points higher than the first half as a result of increasing benefit from product cost reductions, a more favorable product mix and improving SG&A leverage on higher sales volumes through the back half of the year. Specifically, adjusted EBITDA margins in the first quarter of 2016 are expected to be the low point for the year and are anticipated to then improve sequentially each quarter throughout the year. I'm now going to turn the call back over to York to walk through some guidance details to help model out the company's cash flows and earnings per share for 2016. York?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Aaron. In 2016, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $47.5 million to $48.5 million, which represents an increase compared to $42.8 million for the prior year due to several factors. The primary drivers of the increase are the full year impact of the 25 basis point spread increase with our term loan credit facility, our assumption that LIBOR rates modestly increase beginning the second half of 2016, and the addition of interest expense from debt assumed with the Pramac acquisition. The forecast for interest expense includes $42 million to $43 million of cash for debt service costs, plus approximately $5.5 million for deferred financing cost and original issue discount amortization for our credit facility. This interest expense guidance assumes no additional debt prepayments during 2016 and our existing interest rate swap contracts remain in place. In terms of sensitivity of our interest expense guidance to changes in interest rates, it's relevant to note that for every 25 basis point increase in LIBOR rates above the 75 basis point LIBOR floor, interest expense would increase by approximately $2 million on an annualized basis. Based on our guidance provided for 2016, our cash income taxes for the year are expected to be approximately $17 million to $19 million, which translates into an anticipated full year 2016 cash income tax rate of approximately 10%. This represents a notable increase as compared to $6.1 million for cash income taxes in 2015 or a 4.9% rate. The projected higher cash income tax rate is a function of the expected increase in pre-tax profitability levels as each incremental dollar of pre-tax profits over our tax shield is taxed at the expected GAAP income tax rate of 36%. As a reminder, our favorable tax shield through annual intangible amortization in our tax return results in an expected cash income tax rate being significantly lower than our currently projected GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% for 2016. As we drive profitability over time, cash income taxes can be estimated by applying a projected longer term GAAP income tax rate of 36% on pre-tax profits going forward and then deducting the approximately $50 million of annual cash tax savings from the tax shield each year through 2021. Depreciation expense in 2016 is forecast to be approximately $20.5 million to $21 million. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2016, excluding the impact of the Pramac acquisition, is expected to be approximately $29 million to $29.5 million, which is an increase from the $23.6 million in 2015. The increase is primarily the result of changing the classification of certain tradenames to definite-lived intangible assets that are now subject to a two-year amortization period as a result of the new branding strategy to transition and consolidate various brands to the Generac tradename. We'll provide an update to this intangible amortization guidance when we finalize the Pramac purchase accounting. In 2016, stock compensation expense is expected to increase to approximately $10.5 million to $11 million. Related to the Pramac acquisition, recall we are acquiring a majority ownership position in that company. As a result, there will be a minority non-controlling interest associated with this acquisition that must be reflected into the 2016 adjusted net income and EPS. Finally, in 2016, our capital expenditures are forecasted to increase to approximately $35 million to $36 million, which is still only approximately 2.5% of our forecasted net sales for the year as we continue to invest in certain infrastructure, technology and capacity expansion projects. We continue to expect to generate significant free cash flow in 2016 given our superior margin profile, low cost of debt, favorable tax attributes and capital-efficient operating model. For full year 2016, free cash flow generation is expected to be strong with the conversion of adjusted net income anticipated to be over 90%, resulting in improved levels over the prior year. In closing this morning, several of our major end markets experienced significant down cycles during 2015 caused by macro factors that were largely beyond our control. However, we continue to execute during the year on matters that we could control, including significant progress on a variety of strategic initiatives; including driving awareness for our products, developing and expanding our distribution, launching innovative new products and implementing manufacturing improvements. As we navigate through the difficult macro conditions of the near term, we'll be focused during 2016 on several important strategic initiatives to drive our Powering Ahead plan forward, including the integration of the Pramac acquisition just announced. We will leverage our strong liquidity position going forward to continue to invest in the future growth of the business while also evaluating our priority uses of capital to increase shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, I'd like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Mike Halloran of Robert Baird.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Mike.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Mike.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Could you help with a few more details on the acquisition? What percent ownership stake did you guys take?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, the ownership arrangement, Mike, is a 65%/35% arrangement.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And is the idea to increase that over time depending on how it performs or anything set in stone on that side?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have an agreement in place that allows for us to acquire the remaining 35% over a period of time based on not necessarily performance of the business, but based on a series of different things that could occur. So, not to get into too much detail, but it does allow for that and that is the anticipated end game.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then what kind of profitability levels are we thinking about relative to the current portfolio?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Gross margins are very similar to our industrial products. I mean, I think what that business has is quite a bit more op expense as a result of having a pretty far reach globally. So they've got – to support a global footprint, just takes more OpEx. So, the EBITDA margins are lower – on the lower end than what we would see historically so or traditionally. So, there's some opportunities there to realize, as we said in the prepared remarks, some pretty nice cost synergies. This puts us in a very good position to explore that with our component suppliers of major components or those types of products. We also intend to better leverage the OpEx of Pramac through the combination of two companies and some of the cross-selling synergies that we talked about should help us do that. We think that there's an opportunity here to double the EBITDA margin of the business over a period of time. So that's kind of our – that's our goal as we kind of laid out our plan here, and has been pretty consistent with other acquisitions that we've done so we feel pretty comfortable that that's a reasonable thing to achieve.
Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That makes sense. And then on the residential side, maybe if we could just talk about what the inventory levels look like through the quarter but then more importantly, what you're seeing from all the initiatives you put in place. What kind of information are you getting back on closure rates, things like that to the PowerPlay app and all the other stuff?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Mike. This is York. On the inventory side, our inventory – as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did a very good job of rightsizing the inventory levels and working capital levels and monetize, like I said, $50 million of working capital in the quarter. So, we believe our inventories are about in line with where they need to be coming into 2016. If you're talking of field inventories, they're maybe a little bit higher than where they were at this time last year coming into the year. Activations are actually lower in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus 2014 so on a days basis, field inventory days are higher. So we've – those part of our calculus in coming up with our first quarter guidance so we think we've properly reflected that in our commentary on the outlook.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And then, Mike, to answer your question on some of the initiatives that we're focused on in home standby and kind of what we saw as successes or lack thereof in 2015. I would say that the PowerPlay application, the infomercial that we continue to run, the marketing that we're doing in those categories are, I think, having a pretty notable impact on offsetting the really weak power outage environment. I mean, it's amazing to me that we sit here today more than several years removed after any major events, three seasons without a hurricane, without any kind of major outage events, and yet, we're still activating home standby generators at a rate that if you'd told me that five years ago where we'd be today versus where we'd probably should be if we weren't taking into consideration our historical perspective on a lack of outages. We're doing – we feel really good about it and I think we can directly point to things like the expansion of PowerPlay as an example. We expanded that program. That is our in-home selling solution system. That has been very well received by our distribution. We continue to focus on training elements for distribution on not only how to use that app and how to better sell and close sales, but also on the installation side of the equation where we think there's still a pretty good opportunity to make these products more affordable. With close rates, specifically to your question, close rates remain fairly constant year-over-year. We were hoping to see a little bit more of an increase. But I think the reality is setting in that – in an environment like we've got, the backdrop of no outages, it gets tougher every year that goes by when you have that to convince homeowners that this is the product that they need for themselves. So, we're selling against kind of a market that's not necessarily buying and I think we're doing a reasonably good job, as I said in my prepared remarks. I think that home standby activations and shipments have been remarkably resilient in my eye versus the historical backdrop and where the last kind of low outage environment was back in 2010.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just to go back right here on Pramac a little bit. Can you give us a sense of geographic mix and any kind of quantification of how you're thinking about that cost synergy number?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, Jeff, we're not going to quantify the cost synergy number quite yet. We've got a lot of work to do on that front to get oriented around where we think – we know there's some good opportunity there; we just – we're not going to put a number on it quite yet today. As that develops and becomes I think something we have a better line of sight to, we'll be more comfortable talking to that in these quarters ahead. As far as the footprint geographically and where the sales are, as we said in the prepared remarks, we sell over 150 countries, but there's no country – there's no single country that exceeds 15% and, frankly, the rest of them are all below 10%. So, as you can imagine, I mean, there's a fairer concentration of sales in Europe because that's – it's an Italian company and that's where a good part of their sales are. But they've got factories worldwide. They've got factories in Europe, in Italy and Spain but also a factory in Brazil and also a factory in China. And there are 14 sales branches located across the globe; some of those in Europe, but a lot of them outside of Europe So, we're really pleased that this gives us – for us to try and build this organically would really be difficult, but it would take a long time. It's taken Pramac since 1966 to get to this point. I think they've done a remarkable job as a family-owned business kind of expanding into other parts of the globe here. And we're going to be able to take some of the things that we do really well, some of the things that they do really well and the combination of that is going to put us in a very good position in terms of becoming a major player globally for power gen. We were already a major player in North America, but this elevates our game to a whole new level globally.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Just on the residential business, you took a little bit different tack on the storm front and how you're thinking about that. If we're just going to have normal outages versus this kind of low level, what do you think the sensitivity is for the residential versus I think you're saying flat? And then, can we also get an updated dealer count?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And, Jeff, we played this game I don't know many years, right? We've tried to take a reasonable approach to guidance and say, of course, outages at some point will revert to the mean so we issued guidance in that respect over the last several years. This year, given the low backdrop and just what really transpired over the last several years, we said, look, we're not going to anticipate outages increase. So, I think if we return to the normal baseline, they'll go up. If we get a major event, they'll go up. To put quantification around that, I'm not going to do that at this stage. I think it's fair to say though that I think one of the really interesting things here is that a lot of the things that we've been working on in the residential standby market are all new since Sandy. So, the infomercial of PowerPlay, the further expansion of our dealer base, the training that we've done, the tools that we've given them, the focus on installation cost, these are all relatively new initiatives. And what I'm excited about is the fact that activations have remained fairly resilient in a kind of poor outage environment. And we haven't really pressure tested all these new initiatives in a return to the normal or even beyond normal outage environment. So, I think it could be something that is going to be very interesting to see how it plays out. I know it will go up. A question of how far depends on the location of where the outages occur, the frequency, duration of those outages. I mean, there's so many factors. I think we just took the prudent approach this year of kind of saying we weren't going to offer that up.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Run rate to low level.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: And then the dealer count.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, I am sorry. The dealer count, roughly flat year-over-year which for us I think we wanted to grow. We always want to grow dealer count. But I won't say we're disappointed because when you have outages down year-over-year, something like – I think we were down 38% in outage activity year-over-year, severity as we track it, we have to remain neutral on the dealer count. We felt pretty good about that at the end of the day.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. I'll get back in queue. Thanks, guys.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chip Moore with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about where leverage shakes up post deal? What's the goal, I guess, of getting that down and what's the capital allocation thoughts, buyback, dry powder for M&A, et cetera?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. So, we're at 3.5 times coming into 2016. Leverage may pick up just a tiny bit as a result of the deal. So, we've talked about in our prepared comments that our interest expense guidance didn't anticipate any further paydowns of term loan principal. We don't have an excess cash flow sweep requirement this year that's been satisfied by past prepayments of term loan. So, when you talk about capital allocation, then you start thinking about M&A and share buyback before anything else then. So, those are the priorities of capital that we've been talking through since we've been public and I think we demonstrated that last year and will continue to.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. And maybe just one more on international, I think you talked about Latin America. Maybe you can just give us a little more color on some of the other geographies. Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean for us, for the year, Chip, as we said, Latin America was actually pretty flat as the way it ended out. It started out the year with a little bit more bigger than that, in particular, because we're so exposed to Mexico as the peso devalued through the back half of the year and kind of accelerated here in the fourth quarter. It's been a bit softer more towards the back half of the year in terms of trajectory. Europe for us, which up until the Pramac acquisition, is really – we're talking about our Tower Light entity which we've renamed Generac Mobile Products part of the tradename impairment that we talked about this morning actually in terms of our branding strategy. But Europe for us is – they actually did quite well. They had a good year despite of really exciting kind of currency headwinds all year long. So it was a – we were pretty pleased with the performance of that business. It's actually great business. It's run really well and that we're really looking forward to combining that business more aggressively with the Pramac entity and I think there's a lot of opportunities with the combination of those two businesses, not only in Europe but also in some of the other areas that Tower Light serves, which Africa was a decent market for us. The Middle East was up year-over-year for that business so – and that was offset by some weakness in Russia and some further weakness in – we actually have some products that we sell into the Australia and New Zealand markets which continue to kind of – the air continues to kind of come out of that with mining. So, those products are used almost directly in the mining and energy businesses in those parts of the world.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Chip, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson.
Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is actually Patrick Wu sitting in for Charley. Thanks for taking my question.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Good morning. I just wanted I guess touch a little bit on the C&I side and what is the percentage of sales in the quarter that was through rental channel? And so can you quantify how that much was down year-over-year?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. This is York. So, I'd say probably a little over – I mean, if you're talking about consolidated sales, when we do about $1.3 billion in sales, I'd say maybe a little over 10% was tied to the rental side and that's both domestically and internationally. So, you've got our former Magnum and MAC businesses, which is our Mobile Products business in North America and then you've got our Tower Light business, which is our Mobile Products business in Europe. So, when you look at those businesses and you bounce it off to total sales, it's about 10%. And so, when you think about that business, that rental channel is very much tied into oil and gas either directly or indirectly. When you have a direct exposure to oil and gas, when you're renting equipment into the oil patches, obviously that capital or that – the utilization of that equipment is down significantly and, therefore, that's spilling over into the gen rents market because they're just not buying equipment because it's just holistically underutilized. So, when you think about our oil and gas business, I mean the direct business tied to oil and gas is probably down 45% this year so, it's major impact to our result. It was even down harder in the fourth quarter because we were shipping a lot of product in the fourth quarter last year into oil and gas applications...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: 2014, yeah.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: In Q4 of 2014. So, 2015 though was a tough year for oil and gas. It's going to continue to be a tough year for oil and gas. We project probably oil and gas will be down another 35%, 40% in 2016 over 2015 as well, so that's all reflected in our guidance.
Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. That's great color. Thanks. And I guess just going – moving over to the PowerPlay dealer adoption and also just the total cost ownership, I know you guys mentioned it a little bit briefly, but is there a way to maybe take a stab at quantifying total cost of ownership for customers? How is that tracking for you guys? Are you guys seeing as more dealers adopt to that platform, are you guys seeing much better numbers coming from cost of ownership perspective?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We're working on a number of initiatives to target exactly that because we think there's a great opportunity. We've done a number of sensitivity studies to understand the elasticity of demand around lower price point. We know kind of what we're targeting there and we've got a number of initiatives. We basically started a lot of those initiatives in 2015. A lot of that resulted in a great deal of research around how to bring that TCO down, that total cost of ownership down. It's been tracking in a relatively kind of tight range. Some of that due to the product mix and we've introduced some higher kW nodes, which kind of – when you look, you kind of have to peel the covers back. And we're not going to give too much detail on the call here, but we think there's some really good opportunities within that to reduce that. It's really going to come from two areas. The first is what we've – through all the research we've done, we've gone out on hundreds and hundreds of installs alongside dealers to understand just the best practices that exist in installing these products. I mean, it's remarkable the variation between two dealers in a local market to – on a relatively similar dwelling, on a similar style unit, similar style installation how varied the time it takes to do the installation can be. And so we're trying to understand why does dealer A – why can they do it in 50% of the time that dealer B can do it? And so taking those best practices, using our buying power to make sure that we're allowing dealers to buy all the materials they need for the installation, getting the benefit of our scale as opposed to buying a one-off from their local distributor or wholesaler, that's another part of that, is providing that scale and being able to extend that to them. And then lastly, what you'll see in 2016 is some pretty important product level changes on the home standby product that make it easier to install. So, a lot of the learnings that we took from 2015 are being applied to new product introduction. We have a new product coming out in third quarter of this year that's aimed directly at that. So it's our legacy, our flagship product line that has a number of improvements and a number of enhancements to make the unit easier to install. So, there's a lot of focus on that right now. We anticipate that that focus should have a material impact on the TCO over the next several years. So, it's a long slog. You got to put the training in place and you got to put the product changes in place. And there's also some bigger things hanging out there that we continue to work on that we think could have an impact on that even further out. So, we're pretty excited about that because I think it's probably one of the ripe areas for us to help us increase – continue to increase penetration in these products.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Jerry.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Aaron, can you talk about how long you anticipate it'll take to integrate the supply chain into Pramac? I guess, we saw the sweet spot of the new product introductions from Magnum, I think, two to three years out. Is that the type of timeframe we should be thinking about? And then just to take a step back about the point about cross-selling, I guess how much commonality is there in terms of the key components for serviceability in other regions for core Generac products that you would be cross-selling through Pramac distribution?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's a great question, Jerry. As you pointed out with Magnum, it took us a couple of years, two to three years, before we really kind of getting the full impact run rate of the benefit of those cost synergies. As managers of the business, we always want to be optimistic about how quickly we can move with respect to synergies, but the real – the reality of it always ends up being that it's a lot more complicated than that. And as you know, I mean these are – we're going to be making some pretty big decisions, some meaningful decisions and long-term decisions about supply chain partnerships, both on the engine side but also there's some of the other major components like alternators that – where we don't produce alternators today above 500 kilowatts. There's going to be decisions made around that. And also the rationalization, if you will, of manufacturing footprint, how do we best leverage our combined footprints. It doesn't really – frankly, probably doesn't make sense to have two plants in Brazil. It probably doesn't make sense because we have one already. So, there's decisions like that that will get made this year, right, throughout 2016 and it's early, right? It's only February. I expect to start to see some of that as we get into 2017, but really accelerating probably realistically towards the back half of 2017 and into 2018. So, I think it's just the reality of everything from the time it takes to put those relationships together to do the design work. A lot of time, there's a lot of design work involved to work through the inventory lag, introduce the products, get market acceptance. It takes a long time, longer than we'd all like it to take. So, we're going to be realistic about that. It's partly why we're not calling out like a distinct synergy number today because we just need to have a better line of sight to how that's going to play out. We have thoughts around it. And then, in terms of cross-selling opportunities. I mean, when you look at Pramac's product line, it looks very, very similar to our product line, right? For the most part, it's an industrial generator company. It's got a small portable generator business, a residential business as we would refer to it here. And then it's got this kind of small legacy material handling business, really hand pallet trucks, electric and manual, that is just a small part of the business. So, it's primarily an industrial generator company. And I would say that in terms of cross-selling synergies, I mean what we're really excited about there is their products are very well suited to emerging markets, markets where continuous duty and prime operation are the norm versus an emergency duty or standby application as we would see here in North America. So, in other words, the products' engineered to a, I would say probably a more heavy-duty spec which is needed in those countries and that's something that we think for our efforts to expand distribution outside of U.S. and Canada, we have to really take our existing standby product and try and up-sell it as a prime and continuous product. And that's sometimes a misapplication, sometimes not, depends on what the ultimate end game is. But we think that the Pramac product, in many of those areas, is a much better fit. So, we're excited about that. And then, I think the more important thing is Pramac – it's all-diesel products. So, the real get here is, as we've seen in North America, natural gas power generation has been expanding at a growth rate greater than diesel products have been expanding over the last 20 years. We expect that trend to be something that emerges around the globe as natural gas becomes the de facto fuel for countries across the world. And we think that having the distribution footprint through Pramac and allowing us to take those natural gas gensets into that distribution footprint is a really good thing as that trend emerges. Now, it's going to take time. It's a long-term trend. It took a long time here in the U.S. But we think that we're very well positioned with this acquisition to be in the right places that we need to be to sell those products as those markets mature.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Brian.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Brian.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: On the organic revenue growth, I'm just curious, what is your expectation for, I should say, organic revenue decline? What's your expectation for first half organic revenue versus second half?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Well, we didn't get in that level of detail.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: I mean, what we did say in the commentary is first quarter would be in that $270 million to $280 million range, which would obviously result in being down year-over-year what has reported inorganically. So, I mean we didn't give that level of detail in terms of the acquisition. I guess the acquisitions probably have – maybe the best way to answer it is it's probably similar seasonality in terms of how it would model out.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: But being on C&I business, the Pramac business, it's a little bit more consistent seasonally as opposed to the resi business that's more back-end...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Our seasonal patterns are very much driven by – as a company, very much driven by the residential side of the business.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So that's why you see the margin expansion that we have in second half versus first half as well is because of that mix.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. But Pramac's type of C&I business is more – maybe probably more equal – more level loaded throughout the year.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. Right.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. I just wanted to give you a chance to address kind of the back-end loaded nature of the forecast given we're seeing that from a lot of different industrial companies, not all of them, with the seasonal drivers that...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: But that makes sense.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think that that's the big difference here, right? I mean, Brian, a lot of our back-halfedness, if you want to – if I can make up a word there, is really we demonstrated that over the last several years. When you look at our residential products, as we said, I mean they're – it's a seasonal category and seasonal shipments of those products is just stronger in second half than in the first half. And that's really what drives that bus in terms of just overall impact on our 2H versus 1H top line.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. But the main challenge here will be Q1 and then from there from a growth standpoint.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking me in. Quick question. On the oil and gas guidance in 2016 was down 35% to 40%. Was that just oil and gas or was that rental channel and how should we think about that?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Good clarification. That was more just oil gas. Now, there are some spillover in the gen rents, but in terms of the number that I was quoting, that's 35% to 40%.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's really the oil and gas exposure...
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: That was more the direct exposure to oil and gas. But you could argue that rental number, at least the domestic rental number that I was quoting, could have some spillover to gen rents.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But again, we've reflected that I think appropriately in the guidance we issued today.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And kind of focus more on the gen rent side, one of the large players in the space said – talk about being cautious on CapEx in Q1, but possibly accelerating that as the year progresses. Is that factored into your guidance and kind of what are your thoughts that maybe things like the highway bill or general non-res construction, something like that, might actually cause the gen rent piece to be a little bit better than you'd expect?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, we obviously – we have a lot of conversations with national account customers and we've served that group of customers for a long time. And they are very important in their views, obviously, in terms of the way the market buys and the kind of cadence at which they buy, right? And so, that's one of the reasons why we've called out certainly in Q1 not all the (01:01:25) impact and kind of the pullback in oil prices, but also some of the early guidance issued by some of our national account customers around CapEx spending. We're also seeing a bit of a similar type of – not to get off topic, but a little bit of a similar trend with large national account customers in telecom space as well. So, I think it just – what it feels like is a little bit of a slow start to the year in terms of industrial CapEx, whether you're talking about rental CapEx or other industrial CapEx. I think back to your more direct question, Stanley, about the rental side, it's interesting because we get a pretty good look at the book of business that is on national accounts and there are some differences there, depending on geographically where they're located, but also depending on their level of exposure to oil and gas. So, some of the national accounts were more exposed to oil and gas and are more exposed geographically, so the spillover effect of the oil and gas having a bigger impact on certain national accounts where they have bigger footprint in those areas of the country where domestic energy production occurs versus other national accounts who maybe don't have that similar geographic exposure nor the oil and gas exposure. So, it's contemplated in our guidance that it would ramp into the back half of the year on the rental side so that's really the takeaway, I think, from your question. But there's a lot of kind of puts and takes and we're going to watch very closely as the year develops here. The highway bill is interesting. We finally have a highway bill. Non-res construction has found kind of a level footing here. So we like where that is; it's just a question of how much impact does the spillover from oil and gas have on the general rents business in terms of utilization rates, in terms of resale rates on equipment that is currently on auction. Those things are getting impacted in a very negative way right now and so, there's going to have to be some stabilization of those things before we probably see growth. The one immutable truth in all this, this is just a cycle and usually there's a catalyst to make the cycle occur. In this case, it was oil and gas. But the cycle always does come to an end and move up. Fleets do age and they do need to eventually acquire new equipment. We are positioned very well with – on the lighting tower side down to the generator side and we're becoming a growing player in the dewatering pump product lines as well. So, we really like where we're headed there. And then the heating products that added last year with MAC, obviously. We like our product offering.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.
Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. I was just curious, who are your major competitors, guys, when we think about the Pramac acquisition? Can you give us any idea of who like the major competitors you're competing against going to be in that space? And how has that business – their business trended over the last 6 to 12 months?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, the competitive landscape there is – it looks a lot like our competitive landscape on the industrial side. So Caterpillar and Cummins. You've got some of the larger Indian genset manufacturers that sell on a global basis. There's a couple of other European manufacturers that sell on a global basis. So, the competitive set is very similar to what we would see for Generac's industrial products. So, there's really no major surprises there. I think we get to go a little bit further in being toe to toe with them in terms of our scale and our ability to compete more globally with those guys. In terms of trend in the business, the Pramac business, they performed well. They were coming out of a pretty tough economic situation back in 2011 and 2012. The business ran at round on some of the things that they were working on in the alternative energy space. So, unfortunately, they kind of wrapped up in some of the financial difficulties of solar and wind and some of those alternative energy plays that put the company in a very difficult position and it had to go through basically a restructuring. And so, sales dipped down to a pretty low level back in 2011, 2012 and it's been growing kind of back – it's returning back to kind of the pre-restructuring levels, if you wanted to use the term, in more recent periods here. So, performance has been very strong.
Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Just wanted to come back on the margins here a little bit. So, it looks like your margin guidance is down about 50 basis points, and I just want to understand a little bit better the moving pieces. So, it seems like D&A up a little bit and then the offset would be mix from this Pramac deal.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I can get you the pieces there, Jeff, because there are a lot of moving parts. So, if you look at the pieces, gross margin, we did talk about it in the comments, so that would be up about, call it, 175 basis points to 200 basis points. A large part of that is cost tailwinds. So starting to realize the lower level of commodities where we're at, starting to realize the strength in U.S. dollar from our global sourcing, continued efforts on our sourcing – strategic global sourcing team and our new product introduction teams to take costs out, continue to work on logistics and freight costs. We all saw – I think, if you recall throughout 2015, more particularly the first half, we talked a lot about some excess cost of goods sold variances with West Coast port, some things like that. That won't repeat. So, when you think of the cost side, a large part of that, 175 basis point to 200 basis point improvement is going to be on the cost side. And then partially offsetting that is to the tune of 75 bps is the impact of the combined Pramac and CHP acquisitions rolling in. So, that would probably be relative to Pramac being more of a C&I business. They have seen a good C&I margin. It's just that relative to our average, that would take our overall average gross margins down. Those are probably the two biggest pieces. Mix, mix actually is probably – just organic mix is a small impact. Price is a small impact. So costs, tailwinds and then the impact from Pramac and CHP would offset that. And then on the OpEx side, if you're talking like all the way down to EBITDA, Pramac and CHP do have a higher OpEx infrastructure. So, on average, that would probably increase OpEx as a percentage of sales by maybe 100 bps. And then the rest is really just reduced leverage on fixed SG&A on the lower organic sales base. So you put that – and so OpEx, we expect to be about, as a percentage of sales, up 250 bps. And then, that's how you get to EBITDA being down roughly 50 bps overall year-over-year.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And I'm not showing any further question at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Aaron for closing comments.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to our first quarter 2016 earnings release, which we anticipate will be sometime in late April. With that, we'll conclude the call this morning. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Generac Holdings, Inc. Third Quarter Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.
York Ragen: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on a forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our overall financial results for the third quarter of 2015 as net sales increased 2% to 359 million as compared to 352 million in the prior year. As both residential and C&I products experienced low single-digit growth with the benefit of recent acquisitions. Third quarter results also met our most recent guidance expectations which called for a strong sequential quarterly improvement in both sales and margins as net sales increased 25% and adjusted EBITDA margins improved 440 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. Despite the ongoing low power outage environment shipments of home standby generators increased significantly relative to the first half of the year as field inventory returned to a more normalized levels during the quarter. Regarding our C&I products, the quarter benefited from an expected strong seasonal increase in mobile heater shipments from the recent MAC acquisition along with increased shipments of stationary equipment to industrial distributors. However, the significant decline in capital spending levels within the oil and gas sector continued to have a negative impact on year-over-year growth for our mobile products during the third quarter. In addition we are active on our recently announced share repurchase program as we use $64 million to repurchase shares in the quarter which we believe is an attractive use of capital for shareholders given our long-term growth opportunities. As assumed in our previous guidance the power outage environment continued to remain challenging. However in-home consultations and installations of home standby generators improved seasonally at a stronger rate than expected leading to a faster reduction in field inventory levels which improve the effectiveness of our sales, marketing and promotional programs in the quarter. As a result, shipments of standby generators improved significantly on a sequential basis and exceeded our expectations. In addition despite the lower power outage environment shipments of portable generators increased slightly on an organic basis as compared to the third quarter of 2014 as cross-selling synergies from the Powermate acquisition will further realize and as we begin the first shipments of our new IQ 2000 Inventor Generator, the quietest most intelligent portable generator on the market. We remain optimistic on the long-term growth opportunities for residential standby and portable generators. As we've commented many times previously, we believe that growth in the home standby category occurs in a step function manner but the penetration rates for these products accelerating during periods following major outage events and slowing again is the impact of those events subsides. Each success is step that the category takes is representative of a new and higher baseline rate of demand resulting from increased awareness and expanded distribution. We believe the recent performance of the product category demonstrates this pattern continues to hold despite the decline in year-over-year shipments of home standby generators in recent quarters after the robust growth period following the major outage events in 2011 and 2012. In fact, the current baseline level of demand is still much higher relative to the prior baseline period of lower outages which occurred in 2010. Specifically residential product shipments on a trailing last 12 months basis have grown organically at an approximately 12% compounded annual growth rate as compared to the 2010 period despite the lower baseline level of power outage severity over the past three years. We believe this growth is a testament to the under penetrated nature of home standby generators along with the significant investments we have made during the past three years including our innovative sales and marketing program to increase the awareness of the product category as well as our focus on new products introductions and expanding distribution. While the timing of an improvement in the power outage environment is obviously beyond our control, we will continue to focus on a variety of strategic initiatives to increase the awareness, availability and affordability of home standby generators. These initiatives include specific projects and activities targeted towards generating more sales leads, improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of a home standby system. Residential product net sales for the third quarter included two months of contribution from the Country Home Products acquisition that closed on August 1st. Country Home Product or CHP is a leading manufacturer of high quality innovative professional grade engine power equipment used in a wide variety of property maintenance task for larger residences light commercial properties municipalities and farms. The acquisition provides additional scale to our existing platform of engine power tools which includes portable generators, power washers, water pumps and inverter generators. Integration efforts for the acquisition are well underway and we are making encouraging progress in evaluating and pursuing a variety of synergies. These include cross-selling opportunities with our existing distribution most notably with our national retail customers as well as certain cost synergies as we leverage our global sourcing and manufacturing capabilities. Regarding our C&I products the significant decline in oil and gas prices that began towards the end of last year continues to have a negative impact on capital spending from mobile equipment that is primarily used in upstream oil and gas applications. In fact, the price of oil which had shown some signs of stabilization above the $50 a barrel level after the second quarter dropped further during the third quarter and is remained well below the $50 level since that time. Accordingly shipments into this market during the third quarter were below our expectations as we continue to see the negative effect of lower energy prices play out with regard to the impact on the broader general rental markets. Our key national realm of customers have been actively reposition their underutilized equipment from oil and gas for their applications to other rental opportunities. Resulting in a deferral of new equipment’s spending and playing a role in decline in the overall demand from mobile equipment because it is starting in the second quarter of 2014 we experienced a significant increase in demand for mobile equipment used in the oil and gas sector with this strength carrying through the end of the prior year. The contrast of this heavy oil and gas related demand in the prior year and the significant pull back in the current year continues to create a very challenging year-over-year comparison for our C&I products. We remain steadfast and our reviews regarding the long-term opportunity related to domestic energy production and the need for mobile products that are essential for activities. However the adverse impacts from the drop in oil and gas prices including the recent additional weakness continues to have a negative impact on industry fleet purchases. Accordingly we are taking a cautious approach to outlook for this end market as we further evaluate the impact of lower energy prices on the demand for capital equipment. As previously mentioned we experienced the strong seasonal increase in mobile heater shipments during the third quarter from the MAC acquisition which closed in early October 2014. Recall the MAC is a leading manufacturer of premium grade commercial and industrial mobile heaters within the U.S. and Canada. Shipments for these products can be highly seasonal with peak volumes typically experienced during the third quarter as rental equipment company’s dealers and end users prepare for the upcoming winter season. Although a key used for these products are within the oil and gas markets MAC's broad product line is also used in construction market the airline industry and other general rental application. The third quarter of 2015 was our first peak season experience of MAC and we are pleased with resiliency of demand for their mobile heaters in light of the softer oil and gas environment. We remain excited about the cross-selling opportunities available to us as we combine MAC heater product line with Magnum's broad relationships in the equipment rental market which will allow us to further penetrate the energy, construction, airline and general rental markets over the long-term. We also continue to make progress and building out and expanding our capabilities for larger industrial generators. In area we have been intentionally focused on for the past two years after acquiring the Baldor Generator business in late 2013. This include significantly expanding our product line to include a broader more competitive offering of larger output systems as well as improving our distribution capabilities to better enable our industrial distributors to sell these more complex systems. As a result of these efforts, shipments of larger output generators have increased at an encouraging rate throughout 2015. We have also continued to experience growth for our industrial gas generators as we further leverage our core competencies with natural gas engines and expand the power range of gaseous products available. We remain committed to a number of important initiatives targeting an improvement and the specification and closure rates for our industrial distributors that we believe will provide greater opportunities for Generac's future growth in these markets. Our Tower Light acquisition which closed in August 2013 reached the two year anniversary of our ownership during the quarter. Tower Light with headquarter outside Milan, Italy is a leading developer and supplier of a broad lineup of mobile light towers throughout Europe, Middle East and Africa with distribution in over 60 countries. Our product line today includes the industry’s widest range of LED-based lighting towers as well as several hybrid lightening solution that drive significant improvements in fuel efficiency and important consideration in many high class diesel fuel areas of the world. Through their broad product offering and diverse geographic reach Tower Light is having a strong year despite challenging economic growth conditions in several of its key geographic markets. However this performance is being masked within our financial results due to the strength of U.S. dollar relative to the prior year. The company is working on several initiative to drive growth going forward including a number of new product introductions and increasing distribution presence in other penetrate areas of the world. Tower Light is a well-run business with higher margins and power our acquisition strategy of targeting companies that diversify our business with new products customers and end markets well also expanding our geographic reach. I will now like to turn the call back over York to discuss third quarter results in more detail. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the third quarter of 2015 were $359.3 million as compared to $352.3 million in the third quarter of 2014. Sequentially net sales in the current quarter increased 24.6% as compared to $288.4 million in the second quarter of 2015. Looking at our net sales by product class, residential product sales during the third quarter of 2015 increased to $185 million as compared to $183.7 million in the prior year quarter. Contributions from recent acquisitions including Country Home Products which closed on August 1st were mostly offset by a decline in shipments of home standby generators during the quarter. The year-over-year decline in home standby shipment was primarily driven by the continuation of a record low power outage environment that was significantly below the prior year and to a lesser extent by a modest level of inventory destocking in certain channels. However, as expected shipments of home standby generators improved significantly during the third quarter relative to the first half of 2015 as field inventories returned to a more normalized level during the seasonally stronger back half for the year. Lastly, shipments of portable generators increased modestly during the third quarter as compared to the prior year due to cross-selling synergies achieved from the Powermate acquisition, new product introductions and some incremental demand driven by power outage threats. Looking at our commercial industrial products net sales increased to $148.2 million in the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $146.4 million in the prior year third quarter. Strong seasonal shipments of commercial mobile heaters from the October 1, 2014 MAC acquisition contributed to this increase. Furthermore, increased sales of larger output stationary equipment through our industrial distributors are being more than offset by a significant decline in shipments of other mobile equipment going into oil and gas markets. Within our telecom vertical shipments in national count customers during third quarter declined only modestly compared to the prior year as a more challenging year-over-year comparisons have annualized. Currency impact on C&I product sales sold in Latin America and EEMA markets was approximately 2 million during the current year third quarter. On a constant currency basis sales increased modestly year-over-year at our [indiscernible] subsidiaries. Net sales for the other products category were $26.1 million in the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $22.1 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by additional service part sales resulting from our growing base of stationary and mobile products in the market into a lesser extent the addition of aftermarket part sales from recent acquisitions. Gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2015 was 36.3% compared to 37% in the prior year third quarter. The decline was driven by a number of factors including unfavorable product mix unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead related costs and the impact from recent acquisitions. These declines were partially offset by improved pricing along with the favorable impact from lower commodity cost and benefits from overseas component sourcing due to the stronger US dollar. Overall, unfavorable mix in acquisitions impact the gross margins negatively by 90 basis points while price cost impacted gross margins positively by 20 basis points. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2015 increased $3 million or 5% as compared to the third quarter of 2014 primarily as a result of the additional recurring expenses associated with recent acquisition including a 1 million increase in amortization of intangible assets over the prior year. Partially offsetting the increase was a decline in certain other selling, general and administrative expenses during the quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding amortization of intangible assets was 15.6% for the third quarter of 2015 as compared to 15.4% in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $81.2 million or 22.6% of net sales in the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $83.1 million or 23.6% of net sales in the same period last year. This decline in adjusted EBITDA margins compared to the prior year was attributable to the 70 basis point decline in gross margins along with the modest increase in operating expenses as a percent of net sales. Sequentially, EBITDA margins in the third quarter improved 440 basis points over the second quarter. This sequential increase was driven by a 300 basis points improvement in gross margins primarily as a result of favorable product mix and to a lesser extent favorable price cost. In addition to a 140 basis points improvement in operating expenses from the improved leverage on higher sales volumes. GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2015 was $34 million as compared to $36.5 million for the third quarter of 2014. Included in the current year other expense income section is a 2.4 million loss on change in contractual interest rate as a result of an increase in our term loan interest rates spread of 25 basis points for an anticipated period of four quarters. GAAP income taxes during the third quarter were $19.2 million reflective of a 36.1% effective tax rate as compared to $18.4 million or a 33.5% rate for the prior year. This increase in GAAP effective tax rate was attributable to a decline in our section 199 manufactures deduction during the third quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year. Adjusted net income as defined in our earnings release was $63.4 million in the current year quarter versus $57.9 million in the prior year. This increase over the prior year is primarily the result of lower cash income taxes in the current year. The third quarter of 2015 includes the impact of cash income tax expense of $500,000 as compared to $6.5 million in the prior year quarter. This year-over-year decline in cash income taxes was primarily the result of a lower expected cash income tax rate for the full year 2015 of approximately 4% as compared to the full year 2014 rate of approximately 14% expected for the prior year third quarter. The cash income tax rate of approximately 4% expected for full year 2015 is a reduction relative to our previous expectation of approximately 6% primarily due to a modest reduction in expected pretax earnings. As a reminder our favorable tax shield grew annual intangible amortization in our tax return resulted in our expected cash income tax rate being significantly lower than our currently projected GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% for 2015. As we drive profitability overtime cash income taxes can be estimated by applying a projected longer term GAAP income tax rate of 36% on pretax profits going forward and then deducting approximately 50 million of annual cash tax savings from the tax shield each year through 2021. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.49 in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $0.52 per share in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted diluted net income per share, as reconciled in our earnings release, was $0.92 for the current year quarter compared to $0.83 per share in the prior year. The increase was due to the combination of $0.08 from lower cash income taxes, $0.03 from lower interest expense, $0.01 from lower diluted share count from the share repurchases during the quarter partially offset by a $0.03 impact from lower operating earnings. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $29.4 million in the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $47.8 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year decline was primarily the result of higher working capital investment, as inventory reductions were converted into receivables that will primarily be collected in the fourth quarter. This use of cash for working capital during the quarter was partially offset by a decline in cash income taxes into a lesser extent lower capital spending levels versus prior year. With regards to primary working capital the Country Home products acquisition added approximately $11 million of primary working capital to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2015. At quarter end we had a total of $1.05 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount, and $46.5 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $1.01 billion. Our consolidated net debt-to-LTM-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter 2015 was 3.6 times on an as reported basis. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, there was approximately $149 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. As already mentioned we repurchased $2.15 million shares of common stock during the third quarter for $64.4 million under our recently approved share repurchase program. The share repurchase program announced on August 6th, authorized with the company to repurchase up to 200 million of common stock over 24 month period. In total between the Country Home Products acquisition and share repurchases we deploy approximately 140 million of cash during the quarter. We believe this to be a very attractive use of capital for shareholders and demonstrates our confidence in the long term growth prospects and strong free cash flow generation capabilities of our business. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Aaron to provide additional comments on our updated outlook for 2015.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA are expected to approximately $1.3 billion and $270 million respectively. This guidance assumes the power outage during the fourth quarter remained at the very low levels experienced thus far in 2015 and also assumes that energy prices remain at current levels. Should the power outage environment improve during the fourth quarter results could exceed these expectations. Looking at our guidance by product class we expect 2015 net sales for residential products have declined between 8% to 9% as compared to the prior year as a result of the challenging outage environment. However this represents an improvement from the previous expectation of down approximately 11% given the improved end market demand. With regard to C&I products for 2015 we now expect net sales to decline between 15% to 16% as compared to the prior year which compares to our previous expectation of down approximately 10%. The reduction from prior guidance is primarily due to strong and incremental headwinds in the oil and gas market. As we discussed during the second quarter free cash flow generation during the first half of 2015 was impacted by higher than expected inventory levels. We began to amortize the portion of this inventory investment during the third quarter and expect to make further progress during the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect to monetize a significant amount of receivables during the fourth quarter and as a result we now anticipated generating well over $100 million of free cash flow during the second half of 2015. It is important to note that when looking at the seasonality of our cash flow generation over the past several years the company generates a significant amount of its total free cash flow during the second-half of any given year particularly during the fourth quarter. In closing this morning despite a weaker demand environment that persist in key portions of our business we view the current softness to be temporary in nature and we remain optimistic on the long-term growth prospects for our business. We continue to remain focused on matters that we can control including driving awareness for our products developing and expanding our distributing launching innovative new products and controlling cost. In addition we will leverage our strong liquidity position going forward to further diversify our revenue base and expand our geographic presence as well as continuing to opportunistically return capital to shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian Drab: Hey, good morning Aaron. Good morning, York.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Brian.
York Ragen: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Drab: You’ve mentioned the inventory level as normalized. Can maybe comment a little bit more specifically on that is where is inventory in the channel at the end of 3Q relative where it was at the end of 3Q last year and do you expect that destocking would have any impact on your 4Q results this year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So Brian we talked a lot about this at the end of the second quarter because obviously second quarter was adversely impacted by the field inventory position. So as we indicated and as we expected we saw a kind of balance that destocking take place during the third quarter so more specifically where we ended the third quarter in terms of our view and field inventories in terms of rough numbers very close to where we were last year just in terms of total inventory balance for home standby. Now activations the end market installations of product are slower this year than they were last year as we have talked about. So in terms of days of inventory it is a little bit more but we do not think that that is going to impact the first quarter and we think that we have appropriately guided around that in comments we have made this morning.
Brian Drab: Okay, thanks. And on the C&I side in the rental channel, can you give me sense for what percentage of C&I sales went through the rental channel in the third quarter and how is that playing out and how is the oil and gas situation effects in that?
York Ragen: I know we haven’t typically broken that out separately we talked about how last year’s oil and gas was about 10% of our 2014 sales and you know with our new guidance we think that is going to be down about 40% to 45% year-over-year so that obviously has an impact but we haven’t necessarily broken it out specifically on a quarter-on-quarter basis but more commentary. I guess the second part of your question was what again, Brian?
Brian Drab: Well, I guess the one thing that I was looking for have you said in the past what percentage of C&I sales are going through the rental channel I think you have talked about that recent quarter’s revenue.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, I think we’ve said roughly about 15% of the consolidated sales consolidated full sales run through that. But again that was prior this year so this year will be lower as a result of the pullback in oil and gas prices so…
York Ragen: And again that is more in the mobile side of the business.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. And I think we have commented more in a general base in terms of what it was that 15% is actually the prior year the 2014 total consolidated net sales.
York Ragen: A large percent of the mobile business is sold through rental that is how you should look at it.
Brian Drab: Okay. Maybe I follow-up a little bit more on that later. Just two quick ones here on the second quarter call you said that outage activity was down 40% year-over-year in first-half ‘15. Did you give us an update in number today for first nine months?
Aaron Jagdfeld: We didn’t but it’s about the same. It remains in that kind of 40% down so our guidance for Q3 kind of anticipated that and that is kind of where it played out.
Brian Drab: Okay. And then acquisition revenue anything more specific you can tell us about absolute dollars contributed to C&I segment and resi segment from acquisitions in the third quarter?
York Ragen: Yeah, if you looked at our as reported growth was about 2% headline number. The organic piece of that was actually down about 7%. So acquisitions had about 9% impact there and if you break that out organically between residential part and C&I, it's residential organically it was down around 6% and C&I was down just North of double digits.
Brian Drab: Okay, perfect. Thanks guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Market. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Hammond: Hey, guys. Just another one kind of free cash flow. Can you talk about what really drove the receivables up in the quarter and then maybe a little more precision around this well over 100 million of free cash flow you expect to produce in the second half?
York Ragen: Hey, Jeff, it's York. Just the receivable number, if you look at where sales went up sequentially - sales went up sequentially about 25% receivable went up about 29%, so they are about inline and those more heavily waited for sort of the back part of the quarter. So I guess if you calculate the DSO's there they are not out of whack we weren't extending terms for sales and trading up sales for terms. So I'm not worried about the receivable position. What I'm actually pleased about two of them on the foot side is on the inventory side we reduce inventories around $25 million now that obviously will get those into receivables and then will collect that in the fourth quarter. So typically if you look at our the seasonality of our free cash flow fourth quarter is typically a big quarter for us from a free cash flow standpoint this year will be no different and probably even more. So this year because we did have that higher inventory levels coming out of the second quarter that we're monetizing that we'll monetize in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about our guide there relative to the free cash flow in the fourth quarter.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then just can you talk about near misses on some of these hurricane, Patricia hurricane. How that does or doesn't impact your business in terms of it could be an awareness of that even though there is not a lot of power outage?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, it doesn't have much impact. There is a little bit of pre-activity with the Joaquin event and a lot of pre-activities focused on portable Gen. So there is a little bit of that which we called out in our prepared remarks today that impacted some of the growth that we saw in portable generators in the quarter. But it's a very small amount and then like Patricia I mean it's not a populated area. So not even any really pre-storm type of activity and unfortunately that was such a short lived events. Those types of storms any kind of tropical storm they don't like mountain ranges. So unfortunately that's you get the mountains pretty fast inside of Mexico there. So not a tremendous amount of uptick. Jeff, I mean, obviously it gives us a platform that continue to remind people about from awareness and awareness standpoint around home standby, but unless you actually lose power it doesn't have a major impact.
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then finally total comps sounds like you haven't use your comps. But any kind of green shots or expectations for improvement in the '16 there?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, I mean we are obviously we're gathering our guidance year for '16 and talking to our customer base there. So we'll give a more finite read on that, I think once we get around the bend here with our full '16 guidance. But at least for the fourth quarter we've kind of maintained basically the same kind of pacing that we've been seeing here as of late which one of somewhat muted CapEx spending is. There are some. - there is a possibility that these guys they tend from a calendar standpoint, they tend to maybe burn a little bit of budget before the end of the year, that we are not sure if that's going to exist this year in our guidance's. I think properly reflecting our views on that. But as far as green suites for '16 I think we'll hold our commentary till we provide full '16 guidance and we'll have a better read on at that point.
Jeffrey Hammond: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Hi, good morning.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Jerry.
York Ragen: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could talk about how conversion rates have tracked for your direct mail and infomercial activities and can you comment on power play dealer adoption over the course of the quarter as well.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, I mean those are those programs that you mentioned Jerry are they continue to be very effective even more so in this quarter as we said with these talking that took place and the improved kind of end market demand around in home consultations which is the front into that process kind of a leading indicator for us and that comes out of the stand that we do on to drive leads mainly around our in commercial related spend but also we've recently hear this year in particular branched out furthermore on digital campaigns as well as some of the like kind of traditional mail stuffer. The cost for lead if you well has remained actually relatively constant across it vary seasonally. So I think the one thing we are learning is the pacing of that seasonally kind of when to dial up spending and when to dial back. We watch very closely our cost per lease, cost per IHC. The conversion rates of those lease in IHC and that kind of helps us pace our spending around the different media things that we chose. And we obviously we evaluate the different media spent items kind of in relation to one another in terms of where we get our best ban for the box. So there is still in my opinion there is still more to be done there. But in like of the fact that we haven't had any kind of major event in three years. We're really quite happy with that. I think the one think we've recently done some updated brand awareness studying internally here and we do this on an annualized basis or every other year in the category and also the brand. I'm talking home standby now. We continue to see very nice increases in general awareness for the category and more specifically of the Generac brand within the category. And we think that those are really positive things for us when we do finally get those outage events once again and they'll happen again. We're kind of a little bit unsure of how positive that kind of uptake maybe the next time around given that we've been doing a lot to feed the market with a lot of those types of awareness building thing. So I would say all indications today are this is the positive thing that we're going to continue to do. We got to keep it fresh. We've been changing up the things that we do and trying some new things but by large it's I think we're nicely offsetting some of these headwinds and there are being naturally created by not having any major outage events.
Jerry Revich: And Aaron the past couple of years your standby sales that looks like have been up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Does the magnitude of in home consultations that you hopes of had in the third quarters or to similar trend this year? Can you quantify it all how much in home consultations have improved for you?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. I mean I - have they've kind of picked up in the second quarter into the third quarter and that's kind of our pacing here. What we saw as home standby shipments for the third quarter we feel as probably pretty relative but what we're going to see in the fourth quarter and I think there's any not we're anticipating any major lift off for that. Now, if you recall last year we did see a very nice build in home standby sales but there were some underlying event that occurred even though they were up some of localized in kind of the Michigan area around the Troy and also the Toronto area experience some fairly significant outages that drove high sea levels even higher into the fourth quarter and created a situation where that market was very good for us and we call that out last year but really all performed our expectations.
York Ragen: That will be a tough comp.
Aaron Jagdfeld: That's going to be a tough comp for us in Q4 and we're not anticipating that in the guidance we've offered today.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning.
York Ragen: Good morning Chris.
Christopher Glynn: Hey guys, so just kind of put the channel inventory conversation on the terms that we talked about last quarter. I think you said entering to the third quarter they were flat year-over-year on the channel and that was improved from up about 10% entering the second. So is that kind of flat dynamic entering the third that is kind of a static situation now? Is that correct?
Aaron Jagdfeld: It is. It was just to clarify on that. The first quarter was up to slightly when we ended the first quarter year-over-year, second quarter was up considerably.
York Ragen: Yeah. Coming in the third quarter the clarification it was up slightly as well. In comment it's flat but it was actually up slightly and then by coming in the fourth quarter now the - inventories flat but higher on a day’s basis.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then sequentially on the fourth quarter I just guess you just kind of answer that for residential. But it looks like fourth quarter pretty similar to the third quarter overall. Could you comment on any kind of new - relative to that comment that are obviously to you guys internally.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Again I think our comments there as IHDs and activations typically move up seasonally in the second half of the year. So we saw that ramps start in the third quarter we think that the pace for the third quarter is going to extend in the Q4. That's how we've modeled it. Again I think I have to preface those remarks by saying that we are in an ultra-low outage environment and so any kind of outage activity could impact that positively. Although we've not contemplated that in the guidance we're issuing today. But it is something that to remember I mean we're a little bit we get around the corner here three years in a row without any major events 10 years in Florida without a hurricane. Yeah these are pretty low numbers and these patterns tend to role in cycles we seen it before. They typically runs a couple of years two or three years and kind a feels like just statistically speaking we should be around horn here and probably we'd see we would expect to see probably something in the future just mathematically from a probability standpoint. But again we don't control that all we can do it would be ready for it and get our business in a position to react when it does happen.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then the upside on residential in the third quarter relative to your expectations. That was just kind of elbow recent traction around the power play and amp and the different things that you guys work so hard on.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It was I mean we saw even the a lot of just kind a remains pretty much in the same that kind a 40% down year-over-year and actually in Q3 it maybe even kicked down a bit over the first half average. We saw some again nice receptivity to some of the awareness building things that we do some of our sales promotions and things had a better a better effectiveness in the third quarter than the second quarter mainly as a result of that destocking that we've talked about. So I think the channel was just in a better place. First quarter was just to put it in perspective I mean there is a psychology here a bit when you look at our look at 5300 dealers. And that dealer base coming out of a really strong Q4 Q1 was just really quite in terms of end market demand. And so that really kind a shell shock the dealers we ended up a little bit higher inventory position there and then obviously Q2 that is the issue around uptake in the normal seasonal patterns we would have expect it around kind a loan in for the season. By normalizing field inventories during the third quarter, we saw that there was I think the end market and our distribution our channel was in a little bit better buying mood relative to kind of the pace of installations out there and the pace of kind of kind of activity around in home consultations and some of the things we do. But again there is a psychology piece of this and it kind of - and flows a bit and trying to kind a kneel it one quarter to the next it can be a little bit challenging because there is just not a lot of visibility there other than some of the things like IHDs that we have is as leading indicators. But even that is really just one data point. So I think it was just to answer your question more directly, just a lot of the initiatives that we've got working on and being diligent about continue to push our messaging to get powerfully adoption at the dealer level which was another question asked earlier. We continue to see improved adoption of the power place selling system in dealers and so all of those things contributed I think to a stronger Q3 unless than we originally were anticipating.
Christopher Glynn: Yeah, that's really interesting and helpful. And you're mentioned of the distribution being in a better buying mood relative to the pace of installations. Would you characterize that as all in balance with one another?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, it is definitely I mean that the psychology of a small business. I mean these 300 guys are - that's the majority of our sales. They're all small businessmen and so small business people. And so from the standpoint that these are big decisions for them to take a chance to even buying one or two units for a season. And if they're not in a buying mood because they just don't see the activity of the phones are ringing if they're not seeing the lead which was the case kind a coming out of the first quarter and into the second quarter. It can really put a really dampen their buying kind a mood again to use a same word. And we saw that improve in Q3 and I think that goes to the heart of what is in the improvement in Q3's number the outperformance in Q3 home stand by numbers in particular.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charlie Brady from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Charles Brady: Yeah thanks. Good morning guys.
York Ragen: Good morning Charlie.
Charles Brady: Have you guys mentioned expectations for gross margin for the year?
York Ragen: We didn't flat out mentioned as gross margins but it's when you look at the updated outlook and we talked about $270 million of EBITDA that would be just out for 21% EBITDA. And the gross margin assumption underlying that wouldn't be any different than our previous guidance, whereas that slight degradation is just OpEx leverage on the slightly lower sales volume.
Charles Brady: Got it, okay. Thanks. And then can you just talk a little bit about Australia yeah - I guess the partnership where distributor agreement, but I didn't think you mentioned what's going to happened with that kind a potential growth engine.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah the Australia market continues to be an interesting space where we think frankly we do that as it should be a good home standby market I mean it's an Ireland surround by water they get severe weather now and again. And it has higher home values that are similar to actually the home values in Australia on average are higher than that of the US which is the unique situation of itself. So we call that out try that we have partnership in place for numbers of years ago from a distribution standpoint. That's had a mixed results to be very frank. The partnership has actually done a little bit better with some of our engine power tool business than it has with home standby. And I think the challenges of an installed home products and using a distributor who is a little more focused on outdoor power equipment really kind a manifesting itself in that not turning out quite to our satisfaction. And now we continue to focus on the other challenge when we announce that partnership in the Australia market it's gone through a bit of a pullback economically with the drop in commodities and mining in particular. So it's not been the market that it was back when we sign that deal. So we remain kind a committed to really developing the home standby by category on a much more global basis. But distribution remains probably some of our biggest hurdle there. So our M&A pipeline continues to contemplate geographic expansion which is the important piece of that would be distribution. And it would be more likely companies that are more adopted dealing with installed stationary products as appose to either mobile products or engine powered tools. It's not to say that our M&A pipeline doesn’t have any of that in it and it just our focus near term here is expanding our geographic reach in our stationary products. And that would also be in terms of the impact it could have positively on Australia as well as other regions.
Charles Brady: Great. Thanks guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Charlie.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Quealy from Canaccord. Your line is open.
John Quealy: Hey good morning guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning John.
John Quealy: Hey York. So on the distributive base, it sounds like you guys have battled tested that number 5300. You've talked about the order patters getting back to normal maybe in Q3. When you go back in is that in Q1 and Q2 period did you see a lot of churn. The folks you have you think you're sticking with. How do you feel on the constitution of that base as we're pass was seems to be a bad patch.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah I'll tell you our dealer base and obviously it's an area of intense focus for us because it's an important channel for a lot of reasons. But yeah there has always been historically a fair amount of churn in that channel. So just small contracting businesses by their very nature have somewhat of specific halfway. So I think the average length of time and business is about seven years. And those businesses consolidated the vaporized people go out of the business. They sale their business they retire. And again these are small kind of small businesses that generally only a few employees very using not a lot of access to working capital. So we do a lot to help them and I would say that the churn that we've seen is not any different than what we've seen historically. In fact we had at a 100 dealers on a net basis here in the quarter over last quarter which was I think an again in light of the backdrop with outages here. The fact that we continue to grow that base. Now we're only a little bit off of our original our peak from several years ago. So I'm very pleased with the fact that we've held in there on that base. And that we also it's not just holding in there, but actually getting better alignment with that base. The programs that we put in place with power play many of our programs around training not only the technical training around the product of course. But the sales training that we do and now more recently the focus on installation training as we've talked about in order to expand this category kind of to the next level, we believe that affordability is an important part of that equation and so today that average ticket when we look across our power play a book of business there and all the power play proposals that we generated. We are still on that kind of $7 to $8,000 range really closer to $8000 in terms of all in cost and that's a fully installed that includes permitting fuel hookups everything. It's still just too high. We really just need to bring that down and from my advantage point we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to work with distribution to make them more efficient at installing products. So it also improves our bandwidth when times do get in times of heavy demand one of our constraints in expanding more quickly is the fact that distribution base doesn't expand rapidly, it expands over the time and if you have a spike in demand from a major events, we get constraint on both sales and installation bandwidth. So anything we can do on our side to help make those dealers more efficient in both selling and closing sales as well as installing products behooves us positively when we do get spikes in demand. So we're very focused on that, we are very focused on the partnership that we have with our distribution, we are very focused on building our brand. As I said before we've done a number of studies here over the years that we continue to monitor kind of the impact that the things that we doing to create awareness in the category and more specifically around our brand are having in the marketplace and we are very happy with that. I mean we believe that Generac brand is becoming very synonymous with the category. And we see that in parts of the country not only with our dealers but end users who refer to their product as a Generac as opposed to home standby. In fact we even get calls from some of our competitor’s product when there is problem with those products. They call us because they think it's - they think the category is Generac and they look at up on the internet and they end up calling us to ask for service. So obviously we are flatted with that but can't really help them. So we send them back to wherever they need to be otherwise we can sell them a new system. But we are very happy with our progress on those events and also the progress that we made with distribution.
John Quealy: And then my last question here could be considered unfair, but I'll ask it anyway. So there is a lot of talk about your underlying earnings power and we've seen that seasonally change, but you came back pretty strong in Q3 after a tough Q1 and Q2. Do you think you wanted Q2 the representative of some of the worst market that you can imagine. I know you get some new businesses with home country MAC and things like that, but what do you think about the underlying earnings power here with 50 million plus in a week quarter and we've seen 80 to well over 100 in good quarter. I know it's unfair, but what your thoughts on that? I know many of us are talking about it. Thanks, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's great that you guys are talking about it and I don't think it is unfair because we are talking about it and this company we peaked it over 400 million in EBITDA couple a years ago. So the earnings potential for the company is dramatic in my opinion and I am biased of course. But the things that we've done since that point not only in the acquisition we've done as you pointed out John. But also I think in things that I just talked about in terms of alignment with distribution, the programs we've put out there, the efforts that we put forth in growing that residential standby market and some other things that we've done to grow awareness of the category in our brand. In my previous comments, we are not exactly sure how some of that stuff when it does get back to an environment of stronger outage activity. I'm not exactly sure how that's going to play out. I can only say it's going to be positive. I just don't know how positive. So in terms of how much the earnings power can expand. I know that I have seen it my history here. We get into periods like this when we have cycles their down cycles. I have to admit I have seen very few cycles like we've experience this year where basically all of the end markets we serve have been down. Now I think the one qualification I would make would be around oil & gas which kind of took a second leg down from second quarter to third quarter. Pricing kind of oil seem to be stabilize above $50 a barrel and now it's come back down and there is talk that it could be headed into the 30s. That I think the mobile equipment business it's going to be searching for a bottom here as we get into as we exit 2015 and I think though that there are some other good things that are going to come on that and we'll talk more deeply about 2015 guidance on the next call but I feel this company has tremendous earnings potential. I mean the leverage that we get when we expand the top-line is dramatic, you guys have seen what our EBITDA margins have done and even in times with when you take into account the dilutive impact that some of these acquisitions have had on EBITDA margins. The core of this business is going to has just tremendous upside and I think that as initiated the repurchase program because we just feel the shares are undervalued at the current prices and we feel that the best use of our capital is to buy back shares because we believe so much in the future of the business and the earnings potential of the business down the line. So I think everything that we are doing is reflective of our confidence in the business. It is reflective of our kind of our capital deployment strategies that we have talked about kind of ad nauseam with investors and with the analyst community and obviously internally here with our board. But again on buyers so I mention in your question whether fair or unfair but that is my answer.
Operator: At this time, I am showing no further questions. I will like to turn the call back over to Mr. Aaron Jagdfeld, President and CEO for closing remarks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you.

Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Net sales in the second quarter of 2015 were $288 million as compared to $363 million in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in shipments of both residential and commercial and industrial products. Residential products were impacted primarily due to a power outage severity environment that year-to-date, is well below normalized levels and significantly below the prior year, resulting in a decline in shipments of home standby generators and to a lesser extent, portable generators. C&I product sales were impacted by lower shipments to oil and gas markets as well as reduced shipments to telecom national account customers. These declines were partially offset by gains in the industrial distribution channel, improvements in Latin America and contributions from recent acquisitions. Specifically addressing the lower residential sales, residential products historically experience a sequential sales improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter due to pre-season buying ahead of the summer storm season. However, that was not the case during the second quarter of 2015, as demand for home standby generators was impacted by an extremely low power outage environment in the first half of the year that led to excess field inventory levels entering the second quarter. As a result, our normal pre-season sales, marketing and promotional programs were not as effective in the current quarter. The first half of 2015 outage severity was the lowest we have seen since we began tracking this data, as outages were over 40% below the prior-year period and were 20% lower than the last ten-quarter below normal trend that we have witnessed. In addition to reduced home standby generator demand, the extended low period of outages has also significantly reduced demand for portable generators and slowed the expansion of our residential dealer base during the current year. All of these factors negatively impacted the year-over-year comparisons for residential products during the second quarter. As we've commented in recent quarters, over the course of our long history in this business, we have observed that power outage activity runs in cycles. We believe the current down cycle is temporary in nature and we remain optimistic on the long-term growth opportunities for residential standby and portable generators. In the meantime, we will continue to focus on a variety of strategic initiatives to increase the awareness, availability and affordability of home standby generators. We have discussed several of these initiatives at length over the past several quarters, including specific projects and activities targeted towards generating more sales leads, improving close rates and reducing the total cost of home standby products. From a longer-term perspective, we continue to expect the trend of an increasing level of power outages to remain in place, driven by an aging and under-invested electrical grid and the frequency of severe weather, which we believe will continue well into the future. With only approximately 3.5% of U.S. households owning a stationary backup generator, we believe there remains a substantial opportunity to grow this market over the longer term. Turning to the C&I portion of our business, the significant decline in oil and gas prices that began in the second half of 2014 continued to have a notable impact on capital spending for mobile equipment that is primarily used in upstream oil and gas applications. We are also seeing the negative effect that the weak oil and gas markets are having on the broader general rental markets, as our key national rental customers are repositioning the under-utilized equipment from oil and gas related activities to other applications. This is resulting in a deferral of new equipment spending and magnifying the decline in overall demand for mobile equipment. We continue to believe in the long-term opportunity related to domestic energy production and the need for our mobile products that are essential at oil and gas drilling and production sites. However, the adverse impacts from the drop in oil and gas prices is having a greater negative impact on industry fleeting than we'd anticipated. Accordingly, we are taking an even more conservative approach to our outlook for this end market for the remainder of 2015, as we gain further evidence of the impact of the recent move lower in energy prices on the demand for capital equipment. We commented during recent calls that we expect the telecom capital spending environment to remain soft throughout 2015, particularly during the first half of the year, with an assumption for a modest improvement in the second half. As we moved through 2015, however, capital spending by certain of these customers has remained weak and as a result, we have become more cautious on the outlook for the remainder of the year relative to our previous guidance. However, we believe the longer term secular penetration opportunity for backup generators at cell tower sites remains firmly in place due to the need for wireless providers to protect their revenue streams as well as the increasing competitive and regulatory pressures they face to harden their networks. With backup generators only installed on one-third of all cell tower sites today, we believe there is significant runway as the leader in this end market vertical to continue to grow penetration in this market. Shipments within our industrial distribution channel grew during the second quarter 2015 as compared to the prior-year quarter, and we are anticipating solid year-over-year growth of products sold through this channel during the second half of the year. As we have commented over the past several quarters, we continue to make progress in building out and expanding our capabilities for larger industrial generators. This includes significantly expanding our product line to include larger output systems as well as improving our distribution capabilities by increasing distributor product knowledge and sales bandwidth to better enable them to sell these larger, more complex products. We also continue to pursue a number of initiatives during 2015 to improve our specification and closure rates that we believe will provide greater opportunities for future growth in this market. Our latest outlook for C&I products continues to include the expectation of a favorable nonresidential construction environment, which should provide more sales opportunities for our distribution partners to increase their interaction with the engineering firms and the electrical contractors responsible for specifying and selecting our products. Our Ottomotores business, which serves the Latin American market through operations in Mexico and Brazil, once again experienced solid growth in shipments during the second quarter of 2015, which follows a similar level of year-over-year growth experienced during the last two quarters. We believe the improved results at Ottomotores are primarily due to the progress we are making on a number of initiatives targeted at improving the performance of this business. These included a change in leadership during the past year, the realignment of our Latin American commercial sales team, operational improvements and the realization of certain cross-selling opportunities. Despite projections for modest overall economic growth in the Latin American region in 2015, we believe Ottomotores will continue to outperform the broader market as we further execute on these initiatives. The Ottomotores acquisition remains an essential platform for our international expansion efforts by providing a local manufacturing presence and access to the important Latin American market for power generation and other engine-powered products. As announced earlier this week, we acquired Country Home Products, which was founded in 1985 and employs over 200 people at its facilities located in Vermont. Country Home Products is a leading manufacturer of high quality, professional-grade engine-powered equipment used in a wide variety of property maintenance tasks for larger acreage residences, light commercial properties, municipalities and farms. The company's broad product line of chore-related engine-powered tools are largely sold in North America through catalogs, outdoor power equipment dealers, and select regional retailers, primarily under the DR brand name, and include field and brush mowers, chippers and shredders, trimmers, leaf vacuums, stump grinders and log splitters. The acquisition of Country Home Products provides additional scale to our existing platform of engine-powered products, which we have been building since our reentry into the portable generator market in 2008 and our subsequent move back into the power-washer market in 2011. Additionally, this year we have launched several new engine-powered products including a line of clean water and semi-trash pumps. And in the third quarter, we expect to begin shipping our ultra-quiet IQ inverter generator, targeting the recreational market. We anticipate the acquisition of Country Home Products should create meaningful cross-selling opportunities with our existing distribution, most notably with our existing national retail customers. And we believe that we can also generate significant cost synergies as we leverage our global sourcing and manufacturing capabilities. And lastly, as announced this morning, the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million in common stock over the next two years. Given our strong free cash flow generation and the current valuation of Generac shares, we believe initiating our first ever repurchase program at this time represents an attractive use of capital. The authorization of this program does not signal a change to our prior uses of cash. We still intend to use our free cash flow to invest organically, pay down debt to achieve our leverage target of two to three times debt to EBITDA, accelerate our strategy through M&A, and finally, return excess capital to shareholders. That being said, having a share repurchase program in place will allow us to ensure that as we step through these priority uses of cash, we are deploying capital in the most beneficial way on behalf of our shareholders. We remain committed to our Powering Ahead strategy and we're confident we will continue to have the financial flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities, both organically and through acquisitions. I'll now turn the call back over to York to discuss second quarter results in more detail. York?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the second quarter of 2015 were $288.4 million as compared to $362.6 million in the second quarter of 2014. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales during the second quarter of 2015 were $133.5 million as compared to $179.6 million in the prior-year quarter. As Aaron previously mentioned, this decline was primarily driven by a power outage severity environment that year-to-date, continues to remain well below normalized levels and significantly below the prior year. This challenging environment resulted in the slower than expected draw-down of home standby generator field inventories and as a result, reduced the impact of our normal pre-season sales promotions, as our distribution partners were reluctant to invest in additional inventory levels. These factors had a significant impact on home standby generator shipments when comparing to prior-year second quarter. In addition, to a lesser extent, the low level of power outages also resulted in reduced sales of portable generators compared to prior year. Partially offsetting the overall decline in residential products was a modest contribution from the Powermate acquisition. Looking at our commercial-industrial products, net sales were $134.6 million in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $163.5 million in the prior-year second quarter. The decline was primarily the result of reduced sales of mobile equipment going into oil and gas markets, given the significant decline in energy prices experienced thus far in 2015. Again, as Aaron discussed, the sharp decline in energy prices has caused certain of our customers in the rental channel to reduce capital spending for this type of equipment more than originally expected. Additionally, recall that starting in the second quarter of 2014, we experienced a notable increase in demand for mobile equipment used in oil and gas applications, and this strength carried through the end of the prior year. The contrast of heavy oil and gas demand in the prior year and the significant pull-back in the current year has created a very challenging year-over-year comparison for our C&I products. In addition, but to a lesser extent, the year-over-year decline in C&I product shipments was also a result of ongoing weakness in capital spending by certain of our telecom national account customers. Partially offsetting these declines were gains in the industrial distribution channel, improvements in Latin America and contributions from recent acquisitions. Net sales for the other products category were $20.3 million in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $19.6 million in the prior year. This modest increase was primarily driven by additional service part sales resulting from our growing base of stationary and mobile products in the market and to a lesser extent, the addition of after-market sales from recent acquisitions. Gross margin for the second quarter was 33.3% compared to 35.3% in the prior-year second quarter. The decline was driven by a combination of unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead related costs, a lower mix of residential products and the impact from recent acquisitions. Lower production levels compared to prior year and certain transitory overhead costs that carried over from the first quarter were the drivers of the unfavorable absorption, while reduced sales of higher-margin residential products and the additional sales from recent acquisitions caused the unfavorable mix impact versus prior year. These declines were partially offset by more favorable pricing along with the favorable impact from lower commodity costs and benefits from overseas component sourcing due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2015 increased $6.6 million or 13.2% as compared to the second quarter of 2014. The prior-year quarter included a $4.9 million gain relating to a remeasurement of a contingent earn-out obligation from a previous acquisition. Excluding this gain, operating expenses increased $1.7 million or 3.1% as compared to the prior year, which was primarily driven by the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was $52.4 million or 18.2% of net sales for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $84.5 million or 23.3% of net sales in the same period last year. This decline in adjusted EBITDA margins compared to prior year was attributable to the 200 basis point decline in gross margins along with the increase in operating expenses as a percent of net sales, given the reduced leverage on a lower net sales base. GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2015 was $14.8 million as compared to $54 million for the second quarter of 2014. Included in the current year other expense income section is a $3.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which resulted from the pay-down of term loan debt during the current year quarter. Included in the prior-year other expense income section is a $16 million gain on change in contractual interest rate as a result of a reduction in our term loan interest rate spread of 25 basis points in the second quarter of 2014. GAAP income taxes during the second quarter were $8.6 million, reflective of a 36.8% effective tax rate, as compared to $28.4 million or a 34.5% rate for the prior year. This increase in GAAP effective tax rate is driven by a higher contribution from the R&D tax credit in the prior year versus the current year. Adjusted net income, as defined in our earnings release, was $35.3 million in the current year quarter versus $57.1 million in the prior year. This decline over the prior year is the result of the overall decline in operating earnings as previously discussed, partially offset by $10.8 million in lower cash income taxes and $665,000 in lower interest expense. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.21 in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $0.77 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted diluted net income per share, as reconciled in our earnings release, was $0.50 for the current year quarter compared to $0.82 per share in the prior year. With regards to cash income taxes, the second quarter of 2015 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $900,000 as compared to $11.7 million in the prior-year quarter. This year-over-year decline in cash income taxes for the quarter was primarily the result of lower pre-tax earnings along with a notable reduction in the expected cash income tax rate relative to the prior year. Relative to our previous guidance, our cash income tax rate for full year 2015 is now expected to be approximately 6% versus a previous expectation of approximately 17%, primarily due to the reduced full year outlook that we're reporting this morning. As a reminder, our favorable tax shield through annual intangible amortization in our tax return results in our expected cash income tax rate being significantly lower than our currently projected GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% for 2015. As we drive profitability over time, cash income taxes can be estimated by applying a projected longer-term GAAP income tax rate of 36% on pre-tax profits going forward and then deducting the approximately $49 million of annual cash tax savings from the tax shield each year through 2021. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $8.6 million in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $40.5 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year decline was a result of lower operating earnings along with higher working capital investment, driven primarily by an increase in finished goods inventory due to softer than expected demand during the quarter. During the second quarter of 2015, we amended our term loan and ABL revolving credit facilities to reduce our overall borrowing cost and give us more financial flexibility in executing our strategic plan going forward. As part of these amendments, we increased the borrowing capacity on the ABL revolving facility from $150 million to $250 million and reduced the interest rate spread applicable to the ABL facility by 50 basis points across all tiers. And currently with these amendments, we borrowed $100 million from the ABL facility and used these funds to make a voluntary prepayment on the term loan facility of the like amount. Given the lower interest rate on the ABL facility relative to the term loan, the transferring of $100 million of debt between facilities will result in annualized interest cost savings of $1.5 million based on current interest rates. As of June 30, 2015, we had a total of $1.04 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount, and $155.6 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $883.1 million. Additionally, at the end of the second quarter 2015, there was approximately $133 million available on the ABL revolving credit facility. Our consolidated net debt-to-LTM-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter 2015 was 3.1 times. Our term loan credit agreement includes a pricing grid whereby we pay LIBOR plus 250 basis points when our credit agreement leverage ratio is below 3.0 times, and we pay LIBOR plus 275 basis points when the credit agreement leverage ratio is above 3.0 times. As a result of our increased leverage ratio as of June 30, 2015, our term loan interest rate will increase by 25 basis points during the third quarter of 2015. Updating our interest expense guidance for 2015 as a result of the credit facility amendments and the pricing grid spread change, we now expect total interest expense to be in the range of $44.5 million to $45 million, which includes $38 million to $38.5 million of cash outflow for debt service costs, plus approximately $6.5 million of deferred financing cost and original issue discount amortization for our credit facility. This interest expense guidance assumes no additional debt prepayments during 2015, our existing interest rate swap contracts remain in place, and that LIBOR rates do not increase beyond our current LIBOR floor of 75 basis points. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Aaron to provide additional comments on our revised outlook for 2015.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, York. As a result of current end market conditions, we are revising our prior guidance this morning for full year 2015 revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margins. Assuming the record low power outage environment we experienced during the first half of 2015 continues into the second half of the year, net sales for 2015 would be expected to decline approximately 10% for the full year, as compared to the previous downside case expectation for net sales to decline between 2% to 4%. This reduced outage assumption is expected to significantly impact year-over-year comparisons for residential products and is the primary driver for the overall lower guidance. To a lesser extent, our revised sales guidance also reflects a reduced outlook for shipments to oil and gas markets and telecom national account customers during the second half of 2015. Partially offsetting this reduced sales guidance is a modest contribution from the Country Home Products acquisition that closed on August 1. Should the baseline level of localized outage activity return to more normalized levels during the second half relative to the record low levels assumed in our guidance, this could add upwards of $30 million to $50 million of residential product sales with an incremental contribution margin of between 35% to 40%. In addition, when considering our current elevated levels of home standby and portable generators, we believe we would be in an ideal position to quickly meet an increase in customer demand driven by a major power outage event, which historically is more likely to occur in the second half of the year. Looking at our guidance by product class, for residential products, we now expect net sales for 2015 to decline approximately 11% as compared to the prior year as a result of the challenging outage environment. This sales guidance for residential products includes the contribution from the Country Home Products acquisition. With regards to C&I products for 2015, we now expect net sales to decline approximately 10% as compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis. Strong and incremental headwinds in the oil and gas and telecom markets, together with a modest foreign currency impact are expected to be partially offset by gains in our industrial distribution channel, improvements in Latin America and contributions from the MAC acquisition. With regards to the seasonality of net sales in the second half, we anticipate fourth quarter shipments to be marginally higher than the third quarter. Specifically by product class, we are projecting residential product sales to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter due to expected seasonality and a full three-month contribution from the Country Home Products acquisition. We expect a sequential decline for C&I products in the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonally strong shipments of mobile heating products during the third quarter. Gross margins for 2015 are now expected to be approximately 35%, which is relatively flat as compared to the prior year. This compares to the previous expectation for gross margins to improve approximately 75 to 100 basis points over 2014. The revision from prior guidance is primarily the result of a lower mix of residential products due to the change in power outage assumptions previously discussed and to a lesser degree, more unfavorable manufacturing overhead absorption due to the reduced sales outlook. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding amortization of intangibles, are now expected to increase between 200 to 225 basis points over the prior year as compared to our previous expectation of an increase of approximately 75 to 100 basis points. The increase from prior guidance is primarily the result of the reduced leverage of fixed operating expenses on a lower expected sales base, along with the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with the Country Home Products acquisition. These increases are expected to be partially offset by the planned consolidation of the Powermate operating footprint together with certain cost control measures related to SG&A expenses. With the assumption that power outages during the second half of 2015 not improving from the very low levels experienced during the first half, we are revising our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for full year 2015 to approximately 21%. This compares to our previous margin expectation of approximately 23%. With regards to the seasonality of adjusted EBITDA margins in the second half, we anticipate fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins will be slightly higher relative to the third quarter. This expectation is primarily the result of a higher mix of residential products and lower mix of C&I products anticipated during the fourth quarter, along with a modest improvement in fixed operating expense leverage. Free cash flow generation during the first half of 2015 was impacted by higher than expected inventory levels as a result of lower demand in some key areas of the business, along with the impact of the West Coast port congestion issues earlier in the year. However, we expect to monetize a portion of this inventory investment during the second half of the year and anticipate that we will generate over $100 million of free cash flow during the period. It's important to note that looking at the seasonality of our cash flow generation over the past several years, it's very common for the company to generate a significant amount of the year's total free cash flow during the second half of any given year. In closing this morning, although market conditions were below our expectations in the second quarter of 2015, we view the current down cycles being experienced in certain of our end markets to be temporary in nature and we remain optimistic on the long-term growth prospects for our business. With our strong free cash flow, we have the flexibility to continue to drive our Powering Ahead strategic plan forward, including the continued execution of our diversification and international expansion strategies. The announcement of our share repurchase program this morning further demonstrates our confidence in the long-term growth opportunities for Generac and better aligns our capital priorities to maximize shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks and at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Jeff.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So just to understand a little bit better, I think you had said last quarter that if you kept this low level of storms, you thought sales would be down 2% to 4%. Now you're kind of saying 10%. So what's changed in your thinking there over the last quarter?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yeah, I think the – so that 2% to 4%, when we rolled that 2% to 4% up, we were looking at prior year sort of as a baseline. Last year we talked a lot about how prior year was below normal. So, when we rolled up our 2% to 4% for 2015, we were assuming a below-normal outage scenario, similar to prior year, and rolled up our residential results given those assumptions, using sort of prior year as a baseline. What we're finding, Jeff, as you see from our second quarter, the first quarter outage environment was record low, as we talked about; April, May continued to be low; July continued to be low. So, really the difference between last quarter's 2% to 4% down and our guidance that we're really issuing today really assumes that record low outage level from the first half continues in the second half, which is really a lower assumption than what we thought when we rolled out that 2% to 4%.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The outage environment just – it's been a lot lower than even we were thinking – and so I think that prior 2% to 4% guidance that we issued, 2% to 4% down, was kind of predicated on what we were seeing. And actually, as the first half kind of finished out, it came in a lot lower than even we were expecting for a low environment. So it's just been very quiet in terms of outages.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: We felt it prudent to run rate that record low outage from the first half into the second half as an assumption. And then I guess the other piece of that is – a smaller piece – that's the main driver, Jeff, and then a smaller piece of that is just looking at oil and gas and really taking a hard look at what the second half of the year looks like and bringing that down a bit. And then telecom, we had it weak in our guidance from last quarter, but we thought we saw some level of pickup in the second half, which really as we go into the third quarter here, we're not seeing that. So a small piece of the change is telecom as well. So it's mainly the resi side is the main driver with a small piece of oil and gas and telecom.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then – okay – so inventories are up about $100 million year-on-year, $30 million sequentially, and I know you talked about kind of a de-stock. So can you maybe talk about, one, where are channel inventories? Two, what do you think is the right inventory level by year-end versus the $385 million you came out of 2Q? And then of that $100 million year-on-year, how much is kind of acquired inventories versus a core increase?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So, Jeff, I'll speak to the field inventory piece. Field inventories, and again part of that revised guidance downward was the fact that the field inventories with that record low outage environment just have not drained as quickly as we anticipated them to do in the second quarter – and that actually led to a chunk of the mix in the second quarter on the top line was related to excess inventory. Right now, channel inventories as we go into third quarter here, actually year-on-year are, in just kind of gross numbers, are actually about where they were a year ago. So, now, the problem with that is the backdrop it's still a weak power outage environment, so on a kind of a turns basis at retail, if you will, they're not turning as quickly. So arguably, our guidance includes the assumption that there's a little bit more de-stocking to occur here in the third quarter as a result. We didn't kind of get through it all in the second quarter as we had originally anticipated, and that's going to continue on. As far as the $100 million of inventory that (32:55) balance sheet...
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: You mentioned $385 million of inventory of as June 30. The way we've modeled in our planning is probably about a 10% reduction from there. As we talked in the prepared comments, we're going to monetize a portion of that buildup into the second half. And that typically happens, it's just that the run up in the first half was more than expected given the lower-than-expected demand. But we anticipate monetizing a portion of that here in the second half.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And how much of that inventory increase is acquired inventory versus your base?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yeah, well, that $385 million, when you say – I guess the $40 million was exclusive of any – there might have been $10 million of acquired inventory – but that $40 million that I spoke of in terms of reduction wouldn't include any acquired inventory.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is open.
Michael P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Hey. Morning.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Michael P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So just staying on that then, it sounds like at the current revenue run rate, even in the weak environment, the hope is that the de-stocking can be worked through by the time you get to the third quarter, and that maybe by the fourth quarter you get more normalized pull through. Is that the thought process, then?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that's probably a proper way to state it, Mike, is that third quarter's still going to be somewhat impacted by the de-stocking, so fourth quarter should be clean relative to not having that. That's the plan at this point.
Michael P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the buyback side, could you just help me in two respects? First, maybe just talk a little bit about what the buyback signals from your perspective, from a long-term opportunity perspective and what it means for your capital deployment plans in the near-term? And related, how quickly do you guys plan on executing on that buyback?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so I think from an execution standpoint, I'll deal with that first, we're going to begin looking at that right away. I mean, the intent was to get the program authorized and then get it up and running. In terms...
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: It'll get phased in as our...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Of course.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: ...as we generate liquidity and cash flow throughout the second half, depending opportunistically, we could do something quickly here.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think if you step back though, Mike, just in terms of what it means and kind of how we think about it, or how I think about it in particular. When you look at our free cash flow generation, we set out in our IR day back in May – we had our Investor Day – we said we are going to generate over $1 billion worth of free cash flow from 2015 to 2018. And so, we're in a fortunate position that the business generates a high amount of cash flow and we've been very successful, I believe at, up to this point, deploying that through a number of different ways: through acquisitions, we've paid down some debt, obviously organic expansion. All the priority uses of capital that we talk about, we stepped through pretty successfully. And as we look to the future, it just felt like we needed to have a share repurchase program in our arsenal because when you think about, as I think about, a couple of things – paying down debt, maybe not the best use of capital in terms of return, right, just in terms of raw shareholder return. M&A deals, the cycle for M&A is getting a little long in the tooth, and deals that we've been looking at, things have become more expensive. So as we think about the near-term impact, we did the CHP, Country Home Products acquisition, here. We've got a robust pipeline of things that we've been looking at and have been talking about. We wanted to make sure that whatever program we put in place did not impact our ability to do acquisitions. So, we look at this as another tool, a way to enhance shareholder value.
Michael P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And that makes sense. And then one last question, is it fair to say that that call it, $30 million or so sequential move on inventories, maybe a little higher than that, is about what the impact was for you guys from a de-stocking perspective in the second quarter? Or should we be thinking about that a little bit differently?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Probably not all of it. Certainly a portion of it is related to that. I don't know that I could directly tell you exactly what it is. But it's certainly encompassed in that number.
Michael P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great, guys. Appreciate it.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Jerry.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Morning, Jerry.
Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Aaron, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the impact of your dealer inventory reductions on your sales this quarter. Clearly, you under-shipped on demand. Can you just give us an order of magnitude? I appreciate some of that is your own inventory, but just in terms of what impacted your top line, what was the magnitude of that headwind?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think, Jerry, I mean it certainly had an impact. We didn't quantify it. It's a little hard to kind of get our arms around completely but it's certainly has had – it had a larger impact, put it that way, than we anticipated because – and really primarily driven by the fact this ultra-low power outage environment is just not creating the pull-through. And really that had a pretty significant impact. And normally Q2 is a robust quarter for us ahead of the season. The effectiveness of our kind of promotions and marketing and our normal sales programs, our normal pre-season stuff that we do every year just didn't have the kind of effectiveness this year as a result of higher inventory levels which were the result of the low power outage environment. But it had a significant impact on the Q2 home standby business in particular.
Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then, can you just help us understand the revenue guidance back half versus first half? It looks like the guidance was for a 20% sequential increase. It looks like 7% of that or so should be from the new acquisition. Can you help us with just the other pieces, how much is typical seasonality and how much visibility do you have on that now that we're a month into the quarter?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Hey, Jerry, this is York. Yeah, when you look at that sequential increase really from Q2 to Q3, there's really three big pieces to that that you can explain. And one of them we just talked about in the last two questions was this sort of this field inventory de-stock impact on Q2. That should normalize to some extent in Q3 into Q4. So, I mean, that quantity that we're talking about or that significant impact that we're talking about should alleviate into Q3. In addition to the normal seasonality that we see from Q2 to Q3 in the residential product category, and you can go back in time into history and look at seasonal trends on the residential side and see the summer storm season, the heart of it, is the third quarter and that's typically our largest, between Q3 and Q4, those two are our largest quarters, definitely from a seasonal standpoint. So that's the resi side. And then another big pack on the C&I side is our MAC business. So, we bought the MAC heater company C&I business effective October 1. And their season is the third quarter. So, we anticipate selling a good amount of heat product in the third quarter, which won't really annualize from an organic standpoint until October 1. But you should see a large sequential increase from the second quarter to the third quarter just because of the MAC business turning on from a seasonal standpoint. And then your point about the Country Home Products acquisition, that gets layered on. That acquisition from a top line standpoint is very similar to the last number of deals we've done from a bolt-on standpoint, and will contribute effective, really August 1 is when that deal was effective this year. So those are the three main buckets if you're trying to figure out how do you get from Q2 to Q3 in our guidance.
Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good morning.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Chris.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. York, Aaron, good morning. The $40 million inventory reduction, that's what we view as higher levels than you've been at historically, even acquisition adjusted, I would guess. Is that just being appropriate stewards of margins or would it make sense to get it down more and just sacrifice some near-term margin?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So the way I think of that, Chris, is in particular, when you look at where a good chunk of that inventory is on the finished goods side, I mean that's all dry powder for a season. Now if we get through the season and we don't see anything happen – and our assumptions are that we're not going to see power outages in the second half – we may have to take a more aggressive position on that. Right now, the assumptions, the reduction that York spoke to that we're anticipating in the back half is kind of baked in with that ultra-low power outage assumption. So, could it be greater than that, I guess would be the question you're asking, if we would get a more aggressive position on it. But the fact of the matter is you don't want to start discounting that ahead of the season or before the season's done because you're leaving money on the table in our viewpoint. So in particular, I think it's just prudent to wait out the season and see kind of where things end up.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Things happen, and we'll be able to react to it because we'll have the inventory. I think, that doesn't bother us having, being on the ready for an outage.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Now where I see us being probably far too heavy is still on the raw materials side and that's really – the backup of the West Coast port issue that we experienced earlier this year caused us some consternation and then obviously, as we've adjusted our production levels here to better match the demand and slow down the build of our finished good inventories, the raw materials have come at us at a higher rate, as we were anticipating a higher level of sell-through and production rates for the year in total. So, we have long lead time components, and so some of that stuff is stacked up here at a rate that's faster than we had originally anticipated. So those things will de-stock out of raw materials throughout the year as we shut down supply chain and as we've adjusted accordingly.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense, the readiness for a potential event. And so the thought is if you don't get anything like that, then the $40 million could go up basically?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Hypothetically, if we wanted to take a more aggressive stance on the finished goods side, certainly I think – but again, the guidance we're giving today and the numbers we're kind of quoting here are all built around that very low, extremely low power outage assumption, so they don't take a – they don't take the viewpoint that we would discount further. We haven't put anything in the model for that in terms of our guidance. But could we do that if we ended up without a storm season that didn't materialize and we wanted to get more aggressive? It would be available to us. We'd have to make that decision after the season's done.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And did you update the CapEx guidance?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yeah, I think it's still going to be in the low $30 million range, $30 million to $32 million-ish range, $31 million to $33 million.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Sounds good. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Drab of William Blair. Your line is open.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering...
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Hi, Brian.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. First, I don't know, York, if you could be a little more specific on the Country Home acquisition in terms of revenue? Is this closer to a Magnum size level of revenue? Or any more specifics there?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, it's really – Brian, it's – this is Aaron. It's a little – it's closer to some of the more recent transactions that we've done in terms of size. We're not disclosing it because the seller requested that we not do that. So, we're not giving the specifics, but again, it's about 200 people and the transaction – the sales revenue for that business is – it's more like the companies we've bought recently. So it is seasonal as well. It's a seasonal business, so you can imagine their products tend to be more second quarter oriented and into the third quarter here.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then I asked a similar question on the last call, I think, but as I'm looking at the slide that you showed at the Analyst Day, slide 10 where you showed your outage data over the last five years, at this point, I'm wondering, Aaron, if your philosophy or your thoughts around where is that real normal baseline level of outage activity over a much broader timeframe, if that's changing? But when we get to 2020 and we're on this call, are we going to look back potentially and see that the 2010 to 2012 time period was actually abnormal?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think, Brian, that's a great question and one that obviously we've been spending a lot of time understanding. I mean, the data we presented at the Investor Day, we've been tracking outages in pretty great detail since 2010. And this is by far and away the lowest recorded values that we have for the first half of a year. In fact, the first quarter was incredibly low. The last 10 quarters have been really, really low. To answer your question, though, do we see anything kind of fundamentally changing, how do we view this? I've been with the company over 20 years and I – and we're – at the core of what we do, it's all about power generation. We've done a nice job diversifying the company, I think, organically through the addition of some new product categories and then obviously, through acquisitions, which has been helpful to kind of lessen some of the impact of this, but by and large, the core of the company is still about generators. And as a core about generators goes, power outages are an important driver of demand in terms of just the – in particular, on the residential side. Over my course of my career here, I have seen three very up distinctive patterns and three very down distinctive patterns – or flat. I shouldn't say down. It's really more flattish. And that's – we view where we're at right now as really kind of in the flat part of a step. It's very much a step function business, especially on the residential side. Power outages will happen again. It's just – right now, it's just for whatever reason, we're not meteorologists, it's just in fact, most power outages are caused by weather. The weather patterns have been somewhat quiet, El Nino, things like that, that just run in cycles and we're just in one of those down cycles. But every time we get into one of these cycles, we're mindful at the company of continuing to invest in the future because we know the next leg of growth up, the next catalyst is going to happen to bring that awareness level up, expand our distribution and expand that residential market opportunity for us. It's really just – the penetration rate slows down when you get into periods of time like this – and then it accelerates when you get into periods where you see more outages. So I don't think – I personally don't think anything's fundamentally changed – it feels like past patterns. We haven't been a public company in one of these patterns, so I mean, I think that's a little bit painful. Obviously, you can see the challenges in trying to predict this business and in particular, on the residential side from quarter to quarter. We don't like to provide quarter-to-quarter guidance. We've tried to stick to yearly guidance, and even that's been challenging. But the impact from quarter to quarter over the outage environment does move the needle one way or the other. Conversely, it can go completely the other way. If we were to get some kind of event here in the back half of the year, you could see a material increase in the residential business. It's just – it's a difficult business to forecast which makes it a difficult business to operate sometimes – but we're skilled at doing that. We have a flexible operating environment as a result of that and we try to react quickly, both up and down, when changes in the demand profile happen.
Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks for talking through that.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Good morning, Stanley.
Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Quick question. This is kind of a refresher. How much of the product is sold through the rental channel? Is that kind of a 15% to 20% sort of a number?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we haven't disclosed sales by channel, but it's an important part of the mobile business, and the mobile business represents roughly – it's not quite half of our industrial business. It's a little less than half of the industrial business, but it's a – within that mobile business – a good portion of that mobile business is transacted through rental, both specialty rental and then of course, the large national rental. I think it's probably appropriate to say that exposure could be somewhere in the mid-teens in terms of total revenue impact through rental, if you want to think about it that way.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yeah.
Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's great. And kind of switching gears, but kind of staying on the C&I business, can you guys talk about what you're doing to help improve the close rate on the C&I products, more on the commercial side, now that you have such a wider, more expansive product portfolio? Thanks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Great question, Stanley. We've – kind of buried in all of this bad news today was the fact that our industrial distribution channel – which is really the channel you're talking about, has been growing. I mean, we've been, here in North America and frankly, in Latin America, we've seen really nice improvement in that business. We see good momentum in that business. That's kind of reflective of our guidance for the balance of the year here. We're calling out nice solid continued growth in the industrial distributor channel. In terms of focusing on close rates specifically, it all kind of starts with making sure we're specified. So we start kind of upstream and you look at the sales process there and how those products are transacted in the market, a lot of that is bid-spec type of opportunities, as we refer to them, nonresidential construction driven. The engineering firms that specify those pieces of equipment are generally electrically-oriented and they're specifying a – if you're building a hospital, or a supermarket or a manufacturing plant – there's usually a specifying engineering firm involved that works to specify the building's electrical infrastructure. And if a generator is required, either it's code-driven or the business operating parameters require a generator, you have the opportunity at that point to, if you've engaged with that engineering firm, you have the opportunity to be listed in the specification by name. And that's really been a huge focal area of ours over the last, I would say, five or six years in particular. That's kind of where it starts. Improving the close rate then, in our mind is about, as you mentioned, one, it's about having an expansive product line so that you can basically quote a wider market, your total available market. And in this case, our total available market nearly doubled with some of the acquisitions and expansions of product line that we've done here over the last couple of years for that business. And in doing so, we've become, we've positioned ourselves, we think, as a qualified Tier 1 supplier to the market of all industrial back-up systems. And so, that positioning has improved our close rate simply by the fact that we've, in the eyes of specifying engineers and in the eyes of the customers and electrical contractors who purchase that equipment, we're viewed as a competent supplier. And so that's a big part of it. Also, a lot of focus on distribution and what we can do to improve distribution's knowledge of our product, to improve distribution's orientation towards value-engineering solutions. We've spent a good amount of time doing that here, I would say, in the last 6 to 12 months. We've talked a lot about value engineering and that obviously is having, for us, it's having an impact on close rates. Expanding the sales bandwidth, with the addition of all the new products that we've had, is another area that – distributors are independent businesses, so we don't own those businesses – so there's a bit of a convincing to do in terms of convincing a distributor to add sales force, kind of betting on the come that sales will grow. But adding those – increasing that bandwidth for sales – has also helped us with our close rates. And it's kind of a multi-pronged approach to doing that. We're pretty happy with the results at this point. We think there's actually quite a bit more runway there. We're still a smaller, a much smaller market share player in the industrial stationary market. We really view ourselves as kind of in that number three type of slot here in North America. And the number one and two guys are quite a bit bigger and we think there's a good amount of opportunity there to grow our share.
Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, guys. Thank you very much.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Stanley
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Stanley.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi, of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Ross.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Hey, Ross.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I'm still – York, I'm still trying to understand the sizable EBITDA implied ramp in the second half. You went through the revenue drivers and that was helpful. But I'm still trying to get that in the context of what you're saying. You're assuming a continued soft power outage environment. But just given where you're inventories are and the demand environment, I mean, I think your guidance implied like a 50% increase in EBITDA in the second half of the year, and I would think that some of the Country Home would be probably a little bit lower on the margin side, as well as MAC. I don't know if that's necessarily right. But can you run us through the EBITDA ramp a little but more?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Absolutely. Looking at like I did talking about Q2 to Q3 on the top line, on the bottom line EBITDA margin, you should see a favorable mix impact. In particular, on the mix side, we will sell more home standby, which is our best margin products. The MAC heat products actually are very good margins, so as I mentioned, seasonally, Q3 is a strong quarter for that business. And that, from a mix standpoint, should improve. Seasonally, power washers, going into the second half of the year, that volume declines. Those are lower margin products. So just from a mix standpoint alone, we should see a couple hundred basis point improvement in mix, just from the second quarter to the third quarter. So then you get to price/cost, price is probably a small impact, a favorable impact on price. We did roll out some pricing, really in the first quarter that got phased in the second quarter, so assuming a small impact on price, not a lot. But then on the cost side, that's where, actually, where we should see some improvement from first half to second half, maybe 100 bps. Commodity levels and currencies are at lows, at significant lows, so favorable PPV will be coming through. Some of the transitory costs that were in the first quarter that leaked into the second quarter, we don't expect those to occur. So those are the things that we'd see costs improving in. And then just normal, normal just, engineered and our strategic global sourcing team working on initiatives to bring costs down. Those are all things that will improve costs from first half to second half, maybe 100 BPs. And then on the higher volume that I noted in my bridge on the topline, that will just, that will just leverage our fixed cost infrastructure on the SG&A line, and that'll be about 150 bps so that's – you add all that up, it's about 500 basis points from the first half to the second half to get to you the 21% overall for the year.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it.
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: You bet.
Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, York. And then, Aaron, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your dealer network and the health of your dealer network right now, and include maybe what your dealer count was. And just wondering like if you have any sense what portion of your dealer network rely just largely on home standby generators as their primary source of revenue, and therefore is there a risk of them departing from the category just as you see this ongoing soft environment?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. That's a great question. I mean the dealer network actually has been, I think, pretty resilient. We've held kind of in that 5,200 dealer count range. We kind of ended the quarter kind of close to that. Things seem to be – the trending here over the last several months has actually been pretty positive. So we feel good about the dealer count and the fact that that's been hanging in there. Now, there is a fair amount of churn and there always has been, right? These are small electrical and HVAC contracting businesses so there's a – we have a significant effort that is constantly qualifying new contractors into that network – and then obviously as you say, if contractors leave, we talk to those contractors to understand why they're leaving. We talk to them to see if there are ways for us to improve their success rate in their markets either through improved sales tools or improved training. So we don't like to see people to leave the network because we spend a lot of time acquiring them. We spend a lot of effort once they are acquired to develop them. But as far as the percentage of those dealers that are dependent solely on home standby generators, there are a few in the network, don't get me wrong; a lot of where dealers come from is they start out as contracting firms and then as maybe the home standby business develops over time, they may split the business – their business – we see this quite a bit where they end up with two businesses. They keep their contracting firm and they develop a specific generator-focused business entity. They hire salespeople, they hire technicians and they kind of operate kind of as two entities. Some of these contractors actually will get out of the contracting business altogether. But oftentimes they'll keep their contracting business because, as you can imagine, in the installation of these products, having the electrical contracting technical capabilities is important. So there are a few of them that are solely focused on home standby, but most of them have broader businesses. That is – certainly the ones that are solely focused on it, they tend to be the ones who also are the most forward thinking about how can they continue to grow. So they're very focused on the market. They tend to be our better dealers if we get 100% mindshare, if somebody is focused on the category solely. But they also, as you note, could be in a particular situation where that could get even more challenging. But again, the dealer count overall has remained very resilient. I think it's, in fact, we're really pleased with that because it's representative, I think, of the long-term health of the category overall. And I think our share of the category, which continues to – it's been growing – and we think we've got a great formula there for contractors who sign up to be dealers, for them to be profitable.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. I think telecom and energy you were talking about down 20%; what's kind of the new look? And then just on telecom, as you talk to those customers, what's kind of the interest or sense of urgency, or the risk that that wanes as we kind of move away from Sandy and Irene?
York A. Ragen - Chief Financial Officer & Head-Investor Relations: Yeah, Jeff. The update on the oil and gas and telecom, like you said, was we previously had been guiding down 20%. I mean, with that current view, it's the combined category, actually between the two of them even, we're looking at down 35% now, 35%.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: On the telecom customers, and kind of as we talk to those customers, Jeff, clearly, in terms of sense of urgency, when you don't have a strong power outage environment, I think the sense of urgency somewhat relaxes. But I will tell you that all the major accounts that we serve there, have a deployment strategy for product now that includes, is inclusive of, generators on new-build, on new site builds. Where I think the sense of urgency plays out, or lack thereof, is on kind of retrofitting sites that don't have power generation. And that's where maybe that can slow down because you just don't have a burning platform from which to work from. In particular, as we went through Sandy and Irene, some of the events out in the Northeast, clearly there were markets there that were disproportionately impacted by sites not having back-up power. And those sites, there was an initial kind of demand curve there to satisfy some of those areas, to harden those networks first in those regions. And some of that has backed off, obviously, but I think, frankly, I think it's more about just the way that CapEx is being kind of deployed within some of those customers as we talk to them. Some of those dollars are being used for other things, whether they be acquisitions or you know – I just think that there's a bit, too, of this – just in terms of the impact on some of the recent regulations in the marketplace around their appetite maybe for continuing to spend on their networks at this stage of the game until they understand what the ground rules are in terms of who ultimately can traffic across their network and who might end up actually owning the network. So there's a number of factors that play into that, but we think it's just a low point in the cycle. As we said in our prepared remarks, only a third of all cell towers have backup power today. We think that there's going to have to be – so much critical communications and data is going across these networks – that to think that we wouldn't harden that as part of a broader critical infrastructure strategy, whether the telecom companies take that on themselves, and a lot of them have, they're responsible entities that way. But there could become a point in time in the future where that critical infrastructure is viewed in a way that there's a requirement to harden those sites. So, we've heard talk about that over the years. Nothing's come to pass. I think that also relaxes in a low outage environment, the talk around hardening those networks from a regulatory standpoint, kind of also passes as outages have become a little bit in a down cycle here.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is it fair to say the retrofit market on telecom has pretty much dried up this year, so you have a – as anything kicks in there, you get a pretty easy comp?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's our viewpoint on it and that's kind of how we modeled the back half of the year. So it's really, we're down to kind of new site builds that we have visibility to that we know of. In fact, there are some new site builds for some of these customers have been pulled back as well, so we've adjusted for that. So it's not just retrofit as it relates to the back half of the year, the guidance we've given, it's also some new site builds being pulled out.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Aaron Jagdfeld, President and CEO, for closing remarks.

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed, sir.
York Ragen: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Net sales in the first quarter of 2015 were $312 million as compared to $342 million in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in shipments of commercial and industrial products, and to a lesser extent, sales of residential products. C&I product sales were impacted by a decline in shipments of telecom national account customers and softness in oil and gas related capital investment. Residential products sales were impacted primarily due to a decline in power outage severity compared to the prior year which reduced shipments of portable generators along with harsh winter weather that slowed installations of home standby generators, in particular, in the key northeast region of the U.S. However, despite the adverse market conditions, shipments of home standby generators were approximately flat when compared to the prior year and product activations actually remained above prior year levels in every other region outside the northeast. We believe the conditions that contributed to a softer demand environment in the first quarter were mainly temporary in nature, and we are confident that the long term growth drivers for our business remain firmly in place. The power outage severity environment experienced during the first quarter continue to be well below normal baseline levels, and was down significantly relative to the first quarter of 2014. In fact, the outage environment in the first quarter of 2015 was the lowest we've observed in more than five years that we've been tracking outages on a detailed basis. Over the course of our long history in this business, we have observed that power outage activity runs in cycles. As we have said previously, we believe that growth in the home standby category occurs in a step function manner with the penetration rate for the category accelerating during periods following major outage events, and slowing again as the impact of those major outages subsides. Each successive step that the category takes is representative of a new and higher baseline rate of demand resulting from increased awareness and expanded distribution. We believe that the recent performance of the category clearly demonstrates that this pattern continues to play out as the penetration rate of home standby generators grew rapidly following the major outage events that occurred in the second half of 2011 and 2012, and we have been able to hold that new and higher level of demand despite a meaningfully lower power outage environment over the last two years. For some added historical perspective, shipments of home standby generators in the first quarter of 2015 were more than double compared to the first quarter of 2011 which was essentially the prior first quarter baseline before the multiple major outage events that occurred. The resiliency of home standby generators in the current backdrop of such a challenging power outage environment gives us continued confidence in the future growth prospects for this product category when outage activity eventually reverts back to normal levels. We believe holding this baseline level of demand for home standby generators during the current year first quarter has further proved that our initiatives are helping to increase the awareness of the product category including our innovative sales and marketing techniques put in place over the past several years. These efforts are highlighted by our four step system to identify and qualify sales leads and improve the sales closure rate for home standby generators, including our targeted marketing process, our increased use of media spending, the qualification of incoming leads, and the use of our PowerPlay in home selling solutions by our dealers to close sales. We have continuously refined and improved our sales and marketing methods over the past two years and we are seeing favorable trends on a number of metrics involving PowerPlay, including the number of dealers using this in home selling solution, the scheduling of in home consultations or IHCs as we refer to them, and the number of dealers participating in training programs designed to improve sales closure rates. We are also working on some important initiatives during 2015 to further increase sales leads and improve closure rates for home standby generators. In addition, we continue to drive participation in our PowerPro dealer program to further align our industry leading dealer network with the factory. The PowerPro designation is the most comprehensive program available to dealers who need a stringent set of requirements ensuring that our customers receive a best-in-class sales and service experience when purchasing Generac products. From a longer term perspective we continue to expect the trend of an increasing level of power outages to remain in place driven by an ageing and underinvested electrical grid and the frequency of severe weather that we will believe will continue to go into the future. With only approximately 3.5% of US households owning a stationary backup generator, we believe there remains substantial opportunity to grow this market over the longer term. Turning to the commercial and industrial portion of our business, as we expected entering 2015 the significant decline in energy prices experienced since mid-2014 is having a notable impact on demand from mobile equipment that is primarily used in upstream oil and gas applications. Although the steep drop in energy prices has reduced equipment spending in the near term, we believe investment related exploration and drilling activities will be impacted more negatively than spending associated with production activities which is where our products are generally used. In addition, more strict regulations limiting the flaring of natural gas is expected to continue to be a catalyst for increased demand for natural gas generators at these production sites. The waste gas now required to be captured or consumed can essentially serve as a free fuel source leading to a very attractive ROI and payback period for these generators. With the low level of energy prices seen during the past several months, EMP companies are under intense pressure to reduce their operating costs and we are seeing signs in the marketplace that this is leading to additional awareness and resulting substitution of natural gas generators and lure diesel generators within oil and gas applications. As a leader in natural gas generators, we believe we are in a strong position to capitalize on this opportunity. However, we continue to take a more conservative approach to our outlook for this end market for the remainder of 2015 as we gained further clarity on the impact of lower energy prices on the demand for capital equipment. We commented during our prior call in February that we expect the telecom capital spending environment to remain subdued throughout 2015, particularly during the first half of the year. Capital spending patterns of telecom national account customers are generally somewhat cyclical, and as we have commented many times on previous calls, it can be difficult to predict the timing of spending which can vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. However, we believe the long term secular penetration opportunity for backup generators at cell powers remains firmly in place due to the need for wireless providers provide to protect the revenue streams, as well as the increasing competitive and regulatory pressures they face to harden their networks. At only 30% to 35% penetration of generators on cell power side, we believe there is a significant runway to continue to penetrate this sector as the leader in this end market. Our Ottomotores towards the Latin American market through operations in Mexico and Brazil experienced solid growth in shipment during the first quarter of 2015 which follows a similar level of year-over-year growth experience during the fourth quarter of last year. Although we believe the general economic environment in Latin America has stabilized in recent quarters, the improved performance of Ottomotores is more attributable to the tangible progress we have made with our integration efforts and other actions we have taken over the past year. This includes the change in leadership made during the second half of 2014, the recent realignment of our Latin American commercial sales team, operational improvements, and the realization of several cross selling revenue synergies. Despite rejections from modest overall economic growth rate in the Latin American region in 2015, we believe Ottomotores will continue to benefit from an increase in larger project bid activity driven by improving infrastructure spending, as well as continued execution on strategic initiatives. The Ottomotores acquisition remains an essential platform for our international expansion efforts by providing a local manufacturing presence and access to the important Latin American market for power generation and other engine powered equipment. Lastly, we have commented over the past several quarters and the progress we've made during 2014 in building out and expanding our capabilities for large industrial generators. This includes the consolidation of our manufacturing footprint for larger output products into the Baldor acquired facility in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and our focus on increasing our distribution partners product knowledge and sales bandwidth to better enable them to sell these larger generators and systems. We also have a number of new initiatives that are underway in 2015 focused on the continued optimization of our industrial dealer network, as well as various projects to improve our specification and closure rates that we believe will provide greater opportunities for growth in this market. Additionally, our 2015 outlook for C&I products includes the expectation of an improving and more favorable non-residential construction environment that should provide more sales opportunities for our distribution partners to increase their interaction with the engineering firms and electrical contractors responsible for specifying and selecting our products. I would now like to turn the call back over to York to discuss first quarter results in more detail. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the first quarter of 2015 were $311.8 million as compared to $342 million in the first quarter of 2014. Looking at net sales by product class; residential product sales during the first quarter of 2015 were $156.8 million as compared to $164 million in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in portable generator sales as a result of a power outage severity environment that remained well below normalized and prior year levels. Shipments of home standby generators were approximately flat versus prior year despite the low outage environment and harsh winter conditions in certain key parts of the United States. Partially offset in the overall decline in residential products was the modest contribution from the Pramac acquisition. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales were $133.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to $157.4 million in the press release first quarter. The decline over the prior year was primarily the result of an ongoing weakness in capital spending by certain of our telecom national account customers. In the prior year first quarter, shipments to these telecom customers were significant as they invested heavily in hardening their wireless networks with backup power. Starting in the second half of 2014 we experienced a sharp decline in demand from certain key customers as they deferred capital spending on these projects, and this has continued into the first quarter of 2015. To a lesser extent, we also saw reduced sales of mobile equipment going into oil and gas markets given the rapid decline in energy prices. Partially offsetting the weakness in telecom and oil and gas end markets were contributions from the MAC acquisition, as well as growth in Latin America shipments which increased at a solid rate over the prior year. Net sales for the other products category were $21.2 million in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to $20.7 million in the prior year. This modest increase was primarily driven by the addition of aftermarket part sales from recent acquisitions. Gross margin for the first quarter was 32.9% compared to 34.9% in the prior year first quarter. Temporary increases in certain product overhead related costs along with recent acquisitions were partially offset by a more favorable mix of residential products in the quarter. As mentioned in our previously earnings call, we continue to experience incremental costs associated with the West Coast port congestion, unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead related cost due to lower volumes, and mark to market adjustments on copper forward contracts. Once again we expect most of these costs to be temporary in nature and to moderate beginning in the second quarter of 2015, and into the second half of 2015. Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2015 increased $3.5 million or 6.4% as compared to the first quarter of 2014, an increased in marketing and advertising expenses and the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with recent acquisitions were the primary drivers for this increase. Overall, continued improvements and warranty rates although partially offset these OpEx increases. Adjusted EBITDA was $57.1 million or 18.3% of net sales in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to $77.5 million or 22.7% of net sales in the same period last year. This decline in adjusted EBITDA margins compared to prior year was attributable to the 200 basis point decline in gross margins combined with the 250 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of net sales, as a result of the factors just discussed. Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months was $316.9 million. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2015 was $19.7 million as compared to $34.7 million for the first quarter of 2014. GAAP income taxes during the first quarter were $11 million or up 35.9% effective tax rate as compared to $19.5 million or 36% rate for the prior year. Adjusted net income as defined in our earnings release was $34.1 million in the current year quarter versus $50.7 million in the prior year. This decline over the prior years is the result of the overall decline in operating earnings as previously discussed, partially offset by $4.8 million in lower cash income taxes. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.28 in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.50 per share in the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconciled in our earnings release was $0.49 for the current year quarter compared to $0.72 per share in the prior year. With regards to cash income taxes, the first quarter of 2015 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $5.1 million as compared to $9.9 million in the prior year quarter. This year-over-year decline in cash income taxes for the quarter was primarily the result of lower pre-tax earnings along with a reduction in the expected cash income tax rate relative to the prior year. Relative to our previous guidance, our cash income tax rate for full year 2015 is now expected to be approximately 17% versus a previous expectation of approximately 18%, primarily due to the reduced full year outlook that we are reporting this morning. As a reminder, our favorable tax yield through annual intangible amortization and our tax return results in our expected cash income tax rate being significantly lower than our currently projected GAAP income tax rate of 36% for 2015.  As we drive profitability overtime, cash income taxes can be estimated by applying a projected longer term GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% on pretax profits going forward, and then deducting the approximately $49 million of annual cash tax savings from the tax shield each year through 2021. Free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $18.7 million in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to $31.4 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year decline was primarily the result of a decline in operating earnings during the current year quarter, partially offset by reduction in working capital use of cash as compared to the prior year. Free cash flow over the last 12 months was $205.6 million. As we mentioned in our earnings release this morning, we made a prepayment of debt during the first quarter totaling $50 million, this voluntary payment allowed us to maintain our credit agreement leverage ratio below our target of free times and it can be applied against any future excess cash flow payments that are required pursuant to our term loan credit facility. This $50 million debt prepayment resulted in the recording of $1.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt which is included within the other income expense section on the income statement. Updating our interest expense guidance as a result of this debt prepayment, we now expect total interest expense to be in the range of $45 million to $46 million which includes $38 million to $39 million of cash outflow for debt service cost, plus approximately $7 million of deferred financing cost in original issue discounting amortization for our credit facility. This interest expense guidance assumes no additional debt prepayments during 2015, our existing interest rate swap contracts remain in place, and that LIBOR rates then increase beyond our current LIBOR floor of 75 basis points. As of March 31, 2015 we had a total of $1.04 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount, and $150.1 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on-hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $887.1 million. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITA leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2015 was 2.8X. Additionally, at the end of the first quarter 2015, there was approximately $150 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide additional comments on our revised outlook for 2015.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. As a result of current end market conditions, we are revising our prior guidance this morning for full year 2015 with revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margins. Net sales for 2015 are now expected to be approximately flat for the full year as compared to the previous expectation for net sales increase in the low to mid-single digit range. This revised top line guidance is primarily the result of a power outage severity environment that we now expect will remain below normal during the entire first half of the year with the assumption of a returned more normalized baseline levels of objectivity during the second half of 2015. As a result of the change in power outage assumption, we are reducing our forecast for residential product shipments in the first half of the year. Our previous guidance assumed a normalized power outage environment for all of 2015. Importantly, this top line outlook continues to assume no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment and no major power outage events occurring during the remainder of 2015. With regards to seasonality of net sales, we now expect the first half of the year to represent approximately 43% of total sales, and the second half approximately 57%. The expectation of net sales we weighted notably more towards the second half of the year is primarily due to normally seasonality typically experienced with residential products, and it is being further magnified by the assumption of a normal power outage environment in the second half relative to below normal in the first half. In addition, net sales for C&I products for 2015 are also expected to be weighted more towards the second half of the year across several of our channels and end markets including industrial dealers, oil and gas, and Latin America. Looking at our guidance by product class, for residential products we now expect net sales for 2015 to increase in the low to mid-single digit range as compared to the prior year. This represents a decline from our previous expectation of an increase in the mid to high single digit range during 2015 which is a result of reduced power outage expectation for the first half of the year. With regards to C&I products for 2015 we expect net sales to decline in low to mid-single digit range as compared to the prior year on an as reported basis. Strong headwinds in the oil and gas and telecom markets together with the modest foreign currency impacts are expected to be partial offset by gains in our industrial distribution channel, improvements from Latin America and contribution from the MAC acquisitions. Gross margins for 2015 are now expected to improve approximately for 75 basis points to 100 basis points over the prior year, as compared to the previous year expectation to improve by approximately 150 basis points to 175 basis points. The revision from prior guidance is primarily the result of reduced expectations for the first half of the year from a lower mix of residential products due to change in power outage assumption previously discussed, and to a lesser degree more unfavorable manufacturing overhead absorption due to lower sales outlook. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding amortization intangibles are still expected to increase approximately 75 basis points to 100 basis points as compared to the prior year. We are holding this guidance despite a lower sales outlook through focused efforts to control spending in a variety of selling, general and administrative cost. As a result of the updated outlook for net sales, gross margin and operating expenses, we are revising our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of full year 2015. Adjusted EBITDA dollars are now expect to be approximately flat as compared to the prior year, resulting in margins of approximately 23% for the full year. This compares to our previous margins expectation of 23.5% to 24%. With regards to the seasonality of adjust EBITDA margins during 2015, we now expect second half margins to be between 675 basis points to 700 basis points higher than the first half. This expectation is the primarily the result of net sales to be weighted notably more towards the second half of the year as previously discussed, which is expected to result in more favorable product mix and better SG&A leverage on higher sales volumes. We also anticipate an increasing benefit in product cost reduction during the second half through an improvement in manufacturing, overhead absorption and the realization of more favorable commodity prices in foreign currency exchange rates. We expect that we'll continue to generate strong free cash flow in 2015 given our superior margin profile, low cost of debt, favorable tax attributes and capital efficient operating model. Due to the revised seasonality of net sales in EBITDA margins previously discussed, free cash flow is also expected to be notably more weighted towards the second half of the year. In closing this morning, although certain of our end markets are performing below our expectations we remain focused on the numerous compelling secular growth opportunities for our products. We have become a more diversified company in recent years with a strong balance sheet and the capability to generate significantly free cash flow providing us with the flexibility to drive our strategic initiatives. In addition, we are confident in our ability to continue to invest in the future growth of the business, both organically and through acquisitions, as we further implement our head strategic plan. This concludes our prepared remarks, and this time I would like open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Please standby for the first question, that comes from the line of Charley Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Charley Brady: Thanks, good morning guys. On the gross margin you called out a couple items that can perform for specific parts, I'm wondering if you can break out the impact particularly on the port strike impact and the mark-to-market which presumably really transitory relatively to the other two?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Charley, that's relative to gross margin, so it was 200 basis points up prior year actually but 200 basis points from expectations and if you look at pieces of that about a third of that was mix related on the lower home standby mix relative to expectation, probably about a third of that was price in that given a softer demand environment price had a slight impact there were relative to expectations. And then the last third is costs and those are the pieces that you are talking about, the west coast port, the copper mark-to-market these was a unfavorable overhead absorption as well that came through which – as we highlighted more temporary in nature. So about a third of that 200 basis points or more thing that are temporary that would – as we talked about would moderate in Q2 and then in the second half of the year really become neutral factors. 
Charley Brady: Just about the comment on the pricing impact, is that you have been seeing price pressure for some time is that a new phenomenal or your expect to that it continue to go 2015 or there is a recovery 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Charlie this is Aaron, from a pricing stand point you know the there was versus our expectations you know pricing was a little bit a headwind given a amount of the additional promotional thing and drive the market. When you come up of the year then you see this as a pattern and coming of the year without major events, and it was exacerbated in the first quarter by – in our preparatory remarks we said it was the lowest outage environmentally we had seen in the five year since we have been tracking detailed outages. When you have environments like that I you are forced to drive the market harder, with promotion and with other activities that getting to characterize this prices in terms of the characterization of the financial. So those things are things that we would expect to not see as dramatically obviously if you were to get into an environment like what we are saying is going to happen back after the year, with a more normalized type our power outage environment. So it’s really kind of related to the very low outage environment not coming off a year without any major events. 
York Ragen: And to be clear Charley, year-over-year price was not an impact because we had the same dynamic last year, so my count was relative to expectation but year-over-year there wasn’t any impact on price. 
Charley Brady: Alright thanks for clearing that up and just one more on the portable side, can you talk to the inventorial levels in the channel on portables, and at what point does that assuming our outages – and what point does that kind of level out to where you are not seeing a headwind on that going forward?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, I mean the portable inventory is elevated right now, it's both a channel and within our own warehouses, we plan that inventory bills and by seasonally, so we buy ahead of the season last year we didn't get a season, so – then you typically would sell off at a normalized everyday rate, well that every rates also been lower than we would expect because of the low power outage environment to kind of the normal levels. So to answer your question directly in terms of burning it off, it’s going to be longer than what we would have normally planned, we would normally plan a season to be able to burn that product of over the 6 to 9 months if we dint get an event, so that would be the normal plan. Because we've been below normal in terms of regular everyday outages, that 6 to 9 months is probably going to fall more to the nine months or even carry us into the next season here. So we would expect our billed rates and somewhat – what we're talking about here with some of the lower absorption, the overhead absorption that we're dealing with – are both billed rates and our purchases of product will be lower going into this season because we've got plenty product out there. So it’s going to continue to be a headwind for as long as we're below kind of this normalized level of outage period, and we're ready to go should we get an event, we would be more than ready to be able to satisfy a pretty big spike in demand. 
Charley Brady: Great, thanks. I'll hop back in the queue, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Mike Halloran: Good morning guy. So Aaron, is it fair to assume that your residential expectations in the back part of the year is largely unchanged, did I hear right in the comments?
Aaron Jagdfeld: That would be the right assumption, Mike.
Mike Halloran: And can you just give me it to sense if you don’t see normalize patterns materialize on the residential side what that could mean from a growth perspective for you or we just talking similar to this quarter on couple of points of half of the growth expectations for the year. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes I mean, I think we put a band around a year may be 2 to 4% if we state that is kind of ultra-low level below normalized, you know we could see a contraction on 2% to 4% on consolidated net sales as a results of that type of scenario, I mean it’s not what we believe will happened but it been the case here for the last several quarters. So you know I think some of the difficult being providing guidance to this business both on a quarterly basis but also similar year-to-year is the impact from the residential business from outages which you just can’t, it's difficult to quantify the both the exact impact from those outages or the exact impact when you don’t get them, so we have to go up against history there are ton of variable going into that but our best guess is you see something on the line of 2% to 4% impact in consolidated net sales if we don’t get those normal averages in second half of the year. [Cross talks].
Mike Halloran: And then , the oil and gas maybe you could talk about puts and the takes in market, obviously the mobile generation with some of the rental pieces, little bit of a headwind you sounded more positive on some of the flaring related regulations and what that means to your business, is that tracking about how you guys thought it would track it at this point and how are those variables times together?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, you know for us as we look at it I think we're somewhat new to the oil and gas market through our acquisitions over the last two years, so we haven't seen a down cycle like this, all we have seen is up. Which you know I think the first thing that we saw happen and may be just I think it caught everybody by surprise, it's just a rapid deceleration there of the capital equipment spending – for the people who are directly associated with EMP providers who are directly associated with that, rental of that equipment as well. Now you know what were are seeing is a greater impact on the drilling activity side, the exploration drilling side. And frankly most of our equipment ends up in production side, so where production has remained on mind, we haven't seen quite the pullback yet but what we are seeing is where the equipment has had to be – had to have been reallocated because utilization rates are low. The equipment was on drilling and exploration activities in the Balkan or in Permian Basin or in some of the other Shale Plays is being reallocated by the rental companies into other areas of the country to improve their utilization rates, and what that's doing is it's depressing purchases of new equipment in really across the board. So we see kind of a general pullback that's very tight in the areas associated with oil and gas but more – a slowing down if you will in the rental market in general just as that kind of equipment gets reallocated out there. So that part of it was an interesting thing for us to watch and go through and understand. And then, where we are bullish as you pointed out and our comments kind of reflect that is, the substitution effect that we are see happening of natural gas generators, for diesel gensets, so – and that was really starting to come online even before energy prices dropped last year, there were some flaring regulations both in the state and federal level that have come online here over the last year that created a situation where the flurry and the natural gases is greatly reduced or eliminated altogether, so that gas either has to be contained and put into commerce or it's got to be consumed on site. And so the ability to use that fuel in a generator which these guys are already buying thousands of gallons of diesel fuel to power these diesel generators are on site producing temporary power. Having a gas solution and allowing them to use that fuel basically is a free fuel source and also solve the problem somewhat of the flaring to a lesser degree of course, but helping with that challenge. We are seeing that shift still occurring and we actually think that shift is being exacerbate somewhat by the cost pressures that the industry is seeing to reduce their cost of extraction and production. So we think that's a favorable trend longer term, we like where we're positioned for that, and we think that's something that is going to benefit us going forward. 
York Ragen: And just to clarify, we effectively talked about this in our last earnings call when we initiated guidance, we are not changing our guidance relative to oil and gas, here we are holding that. And as we talked last earnings call, we believe that will be down – oil and gas related shipments will be down about 20% year-over-year so we are holding that and feeling the same as we did last quarter.
Mike Halloran: Great, I appreciate the color guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffery Hammond of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Jeffery Hammond: Good morning, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffery Hammond: So I think you mentioned no change on oil and gas, I think you're thinking about telecom down 20 as well, any change there. And anything you're hearing from any of those large customers in terms of visibility for any kind of pick up into the second half?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Jeff this is Aaron. We took down the telecom ever since slightly in the back half of the year based on the conversation we are having with telecom providers, I mean the capital spending that goes on in there – it moves in cycles and we're really at the back end of those cycles often times because the sites get either built or retrofitted invertor generators added later on. It's interesting, some of those key customers have continue to spend money, other key customers have really put the brakes on hard last year, and we saw that it's in our results and obviously we had a really difficult comp, we're up against here in the first half of the year given that, that was so strong, first half of the last year. The conversation we have had with these guys, they’ve got some inventory from Baldor [ph] they made last year, so the first half of the last year that strength. When they hit the brakes on their capital spending projects, some of the build out projects that they were doing last year, they ended up having generators in stock which is unusual, so they’ve got to burn through that first, so that's why even though I think there are some early signs that telecom capital investment maybe starting to come back online here ever so slowly here in the first half of this year, there is bit of inventory they have to work through first and that's really why we kind of tempered our enthusiasm in the back half of the year around that. These guys – unfortunately we don't get a lot of visibility to their cycles, and it can be a bit frustrating for us certainly from a manufacturing standpoint but I think that's one of the reasons why they like us a suppliers is we are able to react quickly to their needs, both up and down, it just can create a bit of choppiness from quarter-to-quarter in that sector for us.
Jeffery Hammond: Okay. And then, can you just talk about quoting activity and activations in home standby and any indications into April that you're seeing this normalization as this weather normalize on activations in the northeast?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, so – this winter was again a brutal winter for installation of product and activation of product, it was – that being said, every region for us outside of northeast we actually saw activation rates improve year-over-year. So I think it was spot on with where the worst part of winter was in terms of snow and cold, it was right in the northeast, and the unfortunate part is that's a really key market for us just given the population density and the power quality in the northeast, and the awareness of the category and everything else. So it was probably disproportionate impact given the harshness of this winter versus even last – last winter arguably it was cold in the northeast but it was actually worse than the Midwest. We actually had a little bit better winter this year in the Midwest. So activation rates outside of the northeast were up everywhere in the first quarter, we've actually seen – I see that we refer to them these in home consultations, actually we're up year-over-year in Q1. So that's a good trend for us, we like that trend, we do think that dealers continue to gravitate towards our PowerPlay selling system, we're driving as much of that as we can with media spends, there is some seasonality with that, you don't want to spend the media in the first quarter when the market is at a slower pace, so your cost for IHC and other metrics that we watch can get away from you pretty quickly if you're not careful with that. So I think what we're – what kind of temporary our enthusiasm for Q2 still – as we go into the quarter here, activations have – well above last year's rate, I wouldn’t say they have spiked as the weather has improved. So there is usually a process there where you got to wait for – there is a bit of a lag, so we'll ramp up spending on our media spend and media buys coming up here in the May and June, come work towards the back half of this quarter. So when you look at front half of the quarter I tell you that we still see things pretty slow in April, relative to residential and a lot of that is due to the fact that power outages still remain very low in April. A couple of here recently in Texas and Louisiana but nothing really to speak up, not much anyway and so it's just been that kind of a quiet period around outages. It's still a generator category and you need outages to drive interest and awareness in the product, we can only do so much on our end, I think we're doing a lot, and I think we've done a lot to hold that new baseline that we've created over the last couple of years but it gets more challenging if you don't have the kind of conditions in the past have created outages.
Jeffery Hammond: Okay. And then just two quick housekeeping, can you give us a dealer count on what you did in terms of ads, net ads, and then what the acquisition revenue was in the quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I'll deal with the dealer ads, we're flat basically from the end of the fourth quarter, so net ads and net deducts were roughly the same.
York Ragen: On the acquisition ad, so we've got two acquisitions built on acquisitions that have an annualized yet the Premec North America acquisition which – that's the portal generator manufacturer, given they are a portable generator manufacturer, they have a small contribution with a negligible contribution, low single digits. And then the MAC acquisition, is the heater company we brought late last year and given there they make heaters and we're off the heat season now so for Q1 that contribution from MAC was also negligible. So combined it was roughly low single digits and one of them in the channel, the other in the C&I channel, product category.
Jeffery Hammond: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brian Drab: Good morning. I just wanted to talk about how you calculate the outage activity, your baseline level of outage activity. You can just remind us how far back does the data go, and I understand you said this morning that we saw the lowest level in the last five years but do we know what it looks like as you go back 8 years or 10 years? And I guess the question is, is there a chance that the baseline of outage activity that we're expecting to revert to in the back half of the year, is that the right baseline? And I think it is and I know you have obviously an extensive database but I just want to maybe ask you to remind us how you calculate that and give us confidence if that's the right baseline.
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think it's a great question Brian, and we've only been collecting detail data since January 2010, so it's about five year period, I unfortunately don't have 8 or 10 year statistics at this stage to give you which is obviously is challenging, we can look at broader statistics. So what happens, the way it's calculated is we look at detailed outages as best as we can track, I mean obviously overtime – over that five year period we've been tracking, we've improved our data gathering message, so it kind of improves every quarter that goes by as we find more avenues to collect the data and in fact we believe we have one of the most comprehensive outage databases that – it rivals anything that's out there, I mean I – it's actually we're pretty proud of it, and it's developed over last five years. Now what it does exclude that baseline normal, the normal baseline we talk about excludes all major outages, so we take out major outages, so we're only looking at what we refer to as normalized outage activity, axe any major event. So we take out all major weather events and all major outage events; ice storms or hurricanes, other major power failures; come out of that number and we created an average and obviously – mathematically as you add quarters to that and if those quarters as they have been for the last nine are very low, that brings the average down. So what we're looking at and what our forecast is built on in the second half of the year is based on recalibrated average, the current average if you will – the long term current average which is arguably a bit lower than it was a year ago or even two years ago. So, I mean we think we're using the right now, it's not an exact science and obviously we qualify all these statements by saying that outages really – where they happen is an important part of that and that's not really reflective in the severity index; the severity index is purely a calculation of the number of households that are impacted, multiplied by the number of hours that they were impacted for, so that is – it's a finite number that we calculate but it does not take into consideration where those outages happen and the reason that's important is if an outage happens in the area where we refer to as an echo effect, if you've had an outage or several outages in a particular geographic region over a short period of time, say two years, and you get another outage, a successive outage, a follow on outage in that same region, you’ll get a much bigger effect to that outage because you will have greater awareness and conceivably more distribution in that area. So that's the unfortunate side of the outage index, it doesn't really – there is not really an easy way for us to do that. Now we're starting to use some pretty decent statistical data to help us understand with each outage we track, what do we expect the impact to be because we're trying to get better visibility into the residential market because obviously as you've seen from our last several quarters, it can be a challenging market for us to get our arms around in terms of the predictability of it. So I think we're just – call it like we see it but we're learning, it's still relatively a young market, the data is relatively new, we think there is a tremendous amount of upside, we like the long term trends but it can be a bit choppy quarter-to-quarter as you've seen.
Brian Drab: Okay, thanks for going through that. I guess just one more follow-up to that, I'm thinking about the time period over which you've been collecting the data. I mean you've been collecting the data for that long but you've been involved in a business that obviously has a lot to do with – where the weather can have a big impact on. So when you look back, maybe just anecdotally or just your personal sense for what the weather is like prior to 2010, is there any reason for us to think that – because obviously 2014 and the beginning of 2015 was light, is there any reason to think that the 2010 to 2013 time period was unusually strong, just – how did that period – what's your sense for how that period compared with 2000 to 2010?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I mean you look at 2006 to 2010, there wasn't a major landed hurricane that occurred at all, that was a really, really low period as well. At baseline I don't know the impact, again we weren’t collecting that data but again, to your point, we've been in this industry, I've got two decades of experience in this industry and it is a step function business, and the step function nature comes from the fact that power outages as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, they run in cycles, I mean we don't pretend to be meteorologist here but weather tends to run a longer term annual cycles to multi-year cycles, and it's impacted by a lot of things. We think that as we think about the future and we think about what's driving our longer term confidence and act of power as a category, it's really the underinvestment in the grid, I mean just skip the weather outages and the timing of those outages and the inability on the cycles that they go in, the fact remains that there has been a massive underinvestment in this country’s power gird and that has not changed, nothing structural has changed in that, it's just basically you've got an environment for whatever reason and for the last couple of years as you've said, we didn't – we had higher than normal activity in 2011 and 2012 and then since 2013 we've had lower than normal activity. So it runs in ways like that and it's part of the – it's really just part of the make-up of this business and it's part of why we try to diversify this company as well, I mean we think there is pieces of our business now today that are much less sensitive to what goes on quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year in terms of outages, I mean commercial industrial market is much more – it's a business decision, it's much more of a code driven market, the mobile equipment space is a great space, it's really not driven by those things at all, it's driven by other cycles like non-residential construction spending, oil and gas, and mining and other things like that but we're trying to desensitize a bit, the company – to use lack of a better term volatility around the residential business that can occur.
Brian Drab: Thanks. As usual, an extremely thoughtful response, I know you guys are being as responsible as you can about this. And then getting more granular, just one last question, on the west coast, the issues that you're having with the ports there. I think York you said there something that might carry over in the second quarter somewhat but then subside. Can you talk about exactly what does expenses worse seeing the west coast ports and the timing of how that resolves itself?
York Ragen: Yes sure, I mean there is a number of things we talked about west coast ports and manufacturing overhead under absorption and copper mark-to-market, specifically the west coast is inefficiencies of getting supply chain, there is a lot of air freight…
Aaron Jagdfeld: There is a lot of air freight, there is a lot of prebuys on inventory, so you've got inventory carrying cost that elevate because you've got to put that inventory somewhere you got to handle it, you got to do things with it but [Cross Talks], and I think the comments there – we saw that building in the fourth quarter and of course as York mentioned the impact that it had on the first quarter gross margin, and we do expect it will be a little bit of that hangover here as we go into the second quarter. But all in all, I mean we've seen it start to obey – the reason we've seen it abide is we've got inventories come back, you see in the raw material inventory numbers at the end of the quarter and we've seen a ton of containers shake loose from that logjam out there in the west coast and that's come at us now and obviously with kind of a slower residential business and a slower performance overall in Q1 there is also some elements of inventory increase related to that, so it was kind of double whammy that way, so not necessarily an ideal situation, put it that way, it's not what we had planned and not what we want to see but we'll work that down over the coming quarters.
Brian Drab: Okay, thanks a lot.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
John Quealy: Good morning guys, a little bit more qualitative question York. So first just a topic of growing the addressable market, can you talk about how the home builder relationships are going in that side and then perhaps a little bit ahead of ourselves but I think worth mentioning here, a lot of the distributor guys are starting to push not yet but soon to be in home storage and residential type storage, can you talk about how you think that market evolves, is and when you get involved, why you would get involved? Thanks guys.
York Ragen: Sure. So, I mean the addressable market, in terms of what we're doing there – we continue to push on that very, very hard over the last several years to try and move the needle there if you will. I think John, the question – just thinking through your question about the onsite storage and obviously there is – supposedly we had some large announcement by one of the players in the industry there that's making electrical vehicles, with an onsite storage system which – frankly, that's aimed at a completely different market than the market we serve, I mean – with that storage system from what we know and – by the way battery storage systems are around for years, that's not a new think per say, it's been around for years. I think the scale at which that company may be able to get from the cost perspective, it's still we believe probably twice as expensive as our standby power generation solution minus any subsidies and obviously it's up to the government to pick the winners and losers here which they have a really poor track record of doing but we'll consistently do anyway. And that system really provides for only a couple of hours backup in an outage, so I think that's really aimed at people who are in the space of producing their own power through solar or through wind and needed temporary storage area, or one hand, the existing temporary storage that they have and really gives them the opportunity to play on the arbitrage between peak rates and non-peak rates with utility companies. We are using it strictly as an emergency backup, I mean I see very few households that will buy that system for that alone. I don't know why you would spend $13,000, $14,000 on a system because you are couple hours of backup when you could spend average installation is about $7,500; why you would spend that kind of money and only get a partial solution. I think that overtime we've looked at – obviously, we keep a very close eye on technology and how it impacts all of our products, not just residential products but our commercial and industrial products, in fact we generally lead the market with innovation and new technologies. Batteries are I think an interesting space, and have been for quite some time, but there is no more slot with batteries; there is no real breakthrough for batteries – at the stage of the game if there ever is, could we foresee a situation where the reciprocating engine, the internal combustion engine is a very efficient – relatively speaking very efficient on a cost basis way to produce power. The combination of that engine with the battery, could that be some kind of hybrid program but potentially down the line, that might be what is the more realistic outcome of this in the years ahead but to be very frank, a pure battery system that would give you the kind of backup that an existing generator would give you today, it would be just incredibly cost prohibitive, because homes use quite a bit of power and to be able to have that kind of storage around will be a massive system, a large system and an expensive systems, it's just not something we see as – certainly not economically viable if not physically viable. So we will watch it and keep an eye on it but I think that's really aimed at a different market than what we serve today.
John Quealy: And then quickly back to today on the homebuilder market, are you guys happy with penetration and success there? And that's it, thanks guys.
York Ragen: Sorry John, I missed the first part of the question. On the homebuilder side, no, we're not happy with that, I think we could be doing more. New home construction – we have seen our penetration rate improve as housings improved but we've said that's really – for us it would represent a great opportunity to introduce the product category to people who are – have made the decision of building new home, who presumably have a mortgage with which to finance that. And you've got also a much lower installation cost as a result of other trades being on side and the walls being opened, permits being pulled; it's just a lot easier to do when you're building a home. Where we are getting traction is, more or so as we've said before with the custom builders because they try and differentiate their product from the larger production homebuilders. And the production homebuilders are really more focused on trying to sell people more square footage. So in terms of amenities it gets little bit challenging for us to make the argument to production builder, a track builder who is – to say, hey you can make a couple of box than selling a generator when frankly their margin is better when they try and sell square footage. So we're kind of moving in opposite directions in terms of what incentivizes those larger builders to offer the product. So it's been challenging for us, we're not giving up on it, we do have an initiative that we have a sales team here that we put back together after the housing market started to show signs of life a couple of years ago, and it had some success. We've had wins where we've got whole developments that – new developments of 10, 20, 30 homes that have a generator or the option to add a generator very easily. So they are manufactured or they are built as generator ready, we're having some success with that but I'm not happy with it, I think we could be doing more personally, I just think there is an opportunity there.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Ross Gilardi of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ross Gilardi: Good morning, guys. Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Ross.
Ross Gilardi: I just wanted to talk a quick one, I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity on your inventory situation, your inventory sales is pretty elevated relative to history in the last year, you mentioned portables before, just curious if you've got any excess inventory in standby or realize it's more typically a made to order product but more generally I'm trying to understand how you squaring elevated inventory position with a significant margin ramp that you are bringing in 2015?
Aaron Jagdfeld: The inventory position is really related roughly to two major factors, one is we have elevated levels of raw material mainly because we are buying ahead of the port congestion to try to keep lines flowing and not have to spend a ton on the air freight but has that became an elongated event that was more difficult. And actually what ended up happening is we were in the first part of the first quarter we were running thin on certain components and that's why we had to air freight them in. Unfortunately as the port situation started to resolve itself towards the end of the quarter we saw a lot of inventory hitting our dock. So it's really the timing of the inventory, we had the air fright parts in but then those parts arrived or on the water waiting out in Pacific Ocean idealing off the coast. So we saw that impact our inventory levels and raw material is a good chunk of that, and then the finished goods inventory as well. Portables which we've called out and we talked about and then also standby, our standby inventory levels are elevated, our residential standby. Again we deliver products there, those are stocked products, those are delivered with zero to two weeks an order; so we keep a certain level of stock at all times. As we look at the channel which we have a very good handle on; what's in channel and what's in our inventory levels, we are somewhat elevated here at the end of Q1. A lot of that is related to the slowness of the market in Q1, so even though I'm saying my shipments were flat year-over-year, they were below our expectations, and that's really what drove I think a lot of our challenges in Q1 in terms of the miss. So that resulted in higher inventory levels, we'll have to burn that off over Q2 and it's kind of why we're for the first half standpoint why we were also saying we were tampering our outlook here for the entire first half.
York Ragen: And from a margin standpoint too what's your comment about the impact on margins on that flow through in Q2 as well?
Ross Gilardi: Got it, great, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris [ph] of Oppenhiemer. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks, good morning. I had a question about Smart Grid potential impacts, I think part of the concept of Smart Gird is that when the scope and length of outages, do you think that's part of pattern you've seen over the past nine quarters?
Aaron Jagdfeld: No. I mean all the data – the grid is only marginally smarter, it's going to take a lot more money than what's been spend to make it really, really smart. And I don't know the smartest grid is not going to help if a tree falls on the line that connects the major power line to your home, no smart grid in the world is going to save you from not having power. So the issue of the grid being above ground is really the bigger issue. Smart grid will certainly help to maybe shorten the duration of outages to a degree which we would think would show up in some of our numbers long term but we just look at raw number of outages that are occurring in those – the number of outages occurring. Again, smart grid is not going to keep that from happening, the number of outages will be what they will be because until the grid is put below ground I think it's still going to be susceptible to all the conditions it's susceptible to today but – and frankly, the grids got a long way to go to get really smart. There is smart metering going on and I think we are starting to see something’s happen as with the utility companies beginning to put some – finally digitization of their monitoring and other things to help identify issues but it's a long road and again, I think our long term perspective here is nothing’s going to be really solved on this front and either somewhat mitigated perhaps but I just – there has been such an underinvestment cycle that there is going to be power outages for the foreseeable future. I mean I'm saying I'm talking decades, I'm not talking years, even if we had a plan today that trillions and trillions of dollars will be needed to bring the grid into this kind of – from a reliability standpoint to five or six times of reliabilities is decades away and in terms of just even be able to execute against the plan even if we had funding, and we have neither the funding nor the plan, so I don't see any changing on that front any time soon.
Unidentified Analyst: I understand the decades concept for overall automation of the grid, it just seems like maybe penetration of things like reclosers and such have the potential to have an impact under the surface. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Stanley Elliott: Quick question on the margins and the back half, if I heard correctly 700 basis points higher. Is that just a normal mix of business and then also I would expect copper raw materials to be a pretty good tailwind for you guys in the back half year, how much of that is kind of baked into this kind of outsized margin you’re guiding to?
York Ragen: There is actually a lot going on there 600 or 650 to 700 basis point increase first half versus second half EBITDA margins. So quickly just to try to bridge it for you. So there will be a slight mix improvement as you go into the second half of the year with the resi increase on the assumed normal outage environment so with the higher resi volume there will be maybe about 100 basis point increase in margin, first half second half related to that mix. There might be about a 100 basis point price improvement given some of the discounting environment and modest price realization that we’re rolling out. So first off half second half there will be a 100 basis point in price, and then to your point there will be about 200 basis point improvement on the cost side, so we will moderate these temporary cost increases with the West Coast ports and copper mark to markets and some of the unfavorable overhead absorption that we have experienced in the first half we will moderate in the second and then you pointed out commodities, the realization as we get through lags on lower commodities as well as FX, I mean we do a lot of buy a lot of components in euro if you will which will cost less in the future, as we work through those legs and the supply chain that should be a tailwind relative to margins so and then we’re always looking at other cost reduction initiatives internally here with our supply chain team and engineering team. So put that altogether that’s about a 200 basis point increase first half, second half and then the rest of that EBITDA increase is about a 300 basis point increase in OpEx as a percent of sales as you leverage the fixed SG&A infrastructure that’s how you get to that 700 basis improvement in EBITDA first half second half.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you can just update us on how the Baldor distribution integration is coming along and what have the early results been for you folks as you transition that network?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So that was a project we really worked on really all of 2014, we started it in early 2014, made our decisions around representation in key markets in second quarter of last year and work to build that up and introduce those either new partners or the changes that we have made to kind of get those things point in the right direction in the back half. I think our comments about stronger second half of C&I this year versus the first half, some of that is that industrial distribution piece continuing to kind of progress. Unfortunately if you change distribution partners or bring new one-board it takes a while to get those new sales team up to speed, to make the relationships in the local markets that need to be made. To get the quote logs, get the quoting activity brought up to a level where I can start to convert orders, it's a very long sales cycle in C&I on that side of the business and we believe that we made some really good decisions last year. We think we have some continued decisions to make around distribution this year, in the beginning of this year and then now we’re just working with those distributors to really make them more effective in their markets and a lot of that is through education and lot of training. There is quite a bit of support being given at those distribution partners in the of developing a sales process a more robust sales process for them that’s not just unique to each distributor but more across the board for all of our distributors to use. So we got some tools that we’re putting together for that and again our comments would be that we think it's going to pick up steam here as we roll through the year and have a bigger impact in the second half of this year than it had in the first half.
Operator: I now would like to turn the call over to Aaron for closing remarks.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Generac Holdings Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Katina and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will facilitate a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.
York Ragen: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today’s call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I’ll now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 improved to 404 million as compared to 376 million in the prior year, an increase of 7%. Home standby generator sales exceeded our expectations during the fourth quarter with product activation rates proving to be resilient as we leveraged our innovative sales and marketing techniques to help create awareness for the product category. Commercial and industrial products continue to represent a growing portion of our business during the quarter as we grew 17% on an as reported basis through the combination of strength in oil and gas markets and the contributions from recent acquisitions. We also generated a record amount of free cash flow during the quarter of nearly $100 million. Despite a power outage environment that remained well below normal levels nationally the number of home standby activations or installations were at elevated levels during the quarter. This strength can be attributed to a variety of factors including an increase in targeted media spend during the second half of 2014 that drove a greater level of in-home consultations or IHCs. Coupled with the increase IHCs we saw a notable improvement in the conversion rate of consultations to sales which we attribute to our focus throughout 2014 on training centered around our PowerPlay selling system. Another contributing factor to the outperformance during the quarter was strength within Midwest region of the U.S., as well as select areas of Eastern Canada which both experienced particularly strong levels of activations resulting from heightened levels of localized outage activity in 2014. We also experienced notable strength during the fourth quarter of shipments of mobile products that serve the oil and gas markets. Increased utilization of this equipment throughout the fourth quarter continues to drive strong orders from our broad base of rental equipment customers. However, heading into 2015 the decline of energy prices experienced in recent months is expected to have a near-term negative impact on demand for oil and gas related products. Before further discussing additional details of the quarter and our outlook for 2015, I want to review some key financial highlights for 2014, as well as share with you several important accomplishments that we believe would position Generac for growth going forward. For the full year net sales declined slightly in 2014 to 1.46 billion as compared to 1.49 billion in 2013. Overall organic sales for the company improved slightly over the prior year when excluding the approximately $140 million sales headwind related to Superstorm Sandy, despite certain of our end-markets performing below our expectations during the year. While this level of organic growth is modest relative to our strong historical track-record, we believe holding the new and higher baseline level of demand during 2014 is an accomplishment worth recognizing. Residential product sales increased approximately 3% when excluding the prior year sales headwinds just mentioned and also improved organically when excluding the Pramac America’s acquisition once again with the backdrop of a below normal power outage environment for the year. Commercial and industrial product organic sales growth was approximately flat year-over-year as strength in oil and gas markets help to offset reduced capital spending with certain telecom customers and overall softness in Latin America. With the annualizing of the Tower Light and Baldor acquisitions during the year, along with the MAC acquisition that closed in early October 2014 our revenue base for C&I products continued to increase in scale and now represents nearly half of our total sales for the company. We also continue to generate a strong level of free cash flow during 2014 totaling $218 million representing 93% of our adjusted net income which is consistent with our solid cash flow conversion average over the past four years. We enter 2015 as a more diversified company with a strong balance sheet and the capability to generate significant free cash flow providing us with the flexibility to drive our Powering Ahead strategic plan forward. In 2014 we executed on a number of initiatives involving our residential products, in particular within our home standby category. As previously mentioned overall sales of residential products improved organically during the year on an adjusted basis. Portable generators declined again in 2014 as a direct result of the lower outage environment experienced, but this was more than offset by organic year-over-year growth in orders for home standby generators. This is very encouraging to see given the lack of power outage nationally both big and small over the last two years. And we believe that we have been very effective at offsetting a nationally lower demand environment through our continued investment in innovative sales and marketing efforts within this important product category. These efforts are highlighted by our four steps system to indentify and qualify sales leads and improve the sales closure rate for home stand by generators. Specifically this system includes our A.M.P. targeted marketing process to find the most likely sales prospects, the optimal selection of media to communicate our message including national television advertising campaigns, telemarketing and direct mail, the scheduling of in-home conciliations for qualified sales prospects through our Generac lead team, and the improvement in close rates through our PowerPlay in-home selling solution. These four elements are interconnected and have been successful in generating new sales leads and improving closure rates for our residential dealers. Recall these sales and marketing tools only became fully operational within the last two years and we have continuously improved on them since their launch. When coupled with the leads that we generate and qualify for our distribution partners, the PowerPlay selling system has become an important tool for our residential dealers and we ended the year with approximately 25% of our dealer base using this approach. As a result of all the above factors we believe we further expanded our market share for the home standby product category during 2014, improving from approximately 70% share in 2013 to 75% share at the end of the year. Heading into 2015 we will continue to focus on our main strategy of increasing the awareness, availability and affordability of home standby generators. We look to accomplish this through a variety of initiatives including some important projects focused on further reducing the total cost of ownership and by using advanced data analytics to further improve how we identify the most likely buyers for these products. From a longer-term perspective, we continue to expect the trend of an increasing level of power outages to remain in place driven by an aging and under invested electrical grid, favorable demographics and the frequency of severe weather that we believe will continue well into the future. With only approximately 3.5% of U.S. households owning a stationary backup generator, we believe there remains substantial opportunity to grow this market over the longer term. Innovation is a core value of Generac and remains an important element of our future growth. In 2014 we introduced a large of numbers of new products throughout the year, while continuing to build a substantial portfolio of future development initiatives. A few notable introductions include a new 22 kilowatt standby generator which provides the highest output for an air-cool generator currently available in the marketplace. Another new product introduction during 2014 was the Guardian Synergy the industry’s first variable speed home standby a best-in-class much quitter more fuel efficient generator with exceptionally clean power output. Also during 2014 we launched the industry’s most cost effective home standby generator called the PowerPact which combines all the benefits of automatic operations with many of the features found in Generac’s market leading Guardian series of generators, with the 7 kilowatt unit starting in an affordable 1899 retail price. We also launched the Rapid Start or RS series affordable generators in 2014 that provide back power with the turn of a new power dial an innovative feature that dramatically simplifies starting an operation making RS series portable generators the easiest to use product in the market today. We also introduced several new commercial and industrial products in 2014. We further expanded our broad line-up of natural gas generators with the introduction of a new 400 kilowatt power node at an industry leading price point. In addition to new stationary products we also introduced a new Vertical Mass light tower that provides the most compact footprint in the industry, improved use of the -- ease of use, transportation runtime and serviceability. We believe our ability to innovate is something that separates us from others in our industry and we have used the growth in our business over the past several years to accelerate our product development efforts and dramatically expand our research and development capabilities. As a result, we expect 2015 will be another important year of new product launches across of our business. The integration of the Baldor Generators acquisition was a key project for our team throughout 2014. We saw significant revenue synergies during the year through the sale of several gaseous fuel generator models that were part of the Baldor product line for use in oil and gas applications and we experienced strong growth for these products selling directly to Magnum's existing rental equipment customers as well. We also implemented some meaningful product cost savings as we transitioned the acquired products and facility into the Generac portfolio. We completed the consolidation of the manufacturing footprint for our larger industrial generators from our Eagle Wisconsin facility to the Baldor acquired facility in Oshkosh Wisconsin. With this project and with the increased demand for the acquired product lines, we expect to see improved utilization of the Oshkosh facility on a go forward basis. The additional capacity we now have is critical to providing our industrial business the ability to aggressively pursue the larger end of the industrial generator market, a market we have largely not participated in prior to the Baldor acquisition. In addition to added production capacity we were particularly focused throughout the year on increasing our sales bandwidth to better enable our distribution partners to sell the larger generators and systems now available to them. This includes a greater level of interfacing with the engineering firms and electrical contractors responsible for specifying and selecting these products in an effort to improve their awareness of our expanded product offering and our innovative solutions. We continue to remain active on the M&A front during 2014 by making two strategic acquisitions. In early September we purchased the brands and assets of Pramac Americas, LLC. This acquisition helps to expand our portable generator product offerings at both the consumer value end of the market to the Powermate brand and for the premium contractor segment through the licensing of the DeWalt brand. We remain focused on building out and enhancing our competitive position within the portable generator market as we look to further solidify our leading market share position by providing a full range of backup power products for the residential market. In early October we acquired the MAC Heater company in Bismarck, North Dakota. MAC is the leading manufacturer of premium grade commercial and industrial mobile heaters within the U.S. and Canada and offers a broad product line that includes flameless, indirect-fired and hydronic surface heaters. These products are primarily used in the oil and gas and construction markets, as well as other industrial sectors and are sold through national equipment rental companies and independent dealers. We're excited about the potential cross-selling opportunity this acquisition brings to us as we combine MAC's heater product line with Magnum's broad relationships in the equipment rental market and allows us to further penetrate the oil and gas market over the long-term. We have been talking in recent quarters about the notable strength during 2014 from rental equipment customers in the U.S. as a result of strong demand in the oil and gas market. This has come from the broad product line of mobile and stationary equipment that we have assembled through our Magnum and Baldor acquisitions including gaseous fuel generators that are capable of running on wellhead gas generated at drilling and production sites. A more stringent regulatory environment around the flaring of natural gas at these sites has been an important catalyst for increased awareness and demand for these generators throughout the year. We have also talked about the attractive secular opportunity related to domestic energy production for other support equipments such as light towers, mobile heaters, and portable pumps that are essential at these oil and gas sites. We made good progress during the second half of 2014 in evaluating the overall opportunity in oil and gas to better determine the appropriate levels of investment and resources needed as we position ourselves to participate in this end-market over the longer-term. This evaluation combined with our initial success in selling products to this market during the year clearly validates that there is an opportunity to further invest and better position Generac to participate in what we believe will be an attractive long-term up cycle in this end-market. However with the rapid decline in oil prices seen in the recent months we believe that it’s necessary to take a more measured approach at least in the short-term with respect to our level of investment. Also until we fully understand the impact of lower energy prices on the demand for capital equipment we're holding off on discussing any specifics regarding the overall industrial market opportunity for Generac's products within oil and gas. I would now like to turn the call back York to discuss fourth quarter results in more detail. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2014 were 404 million, a 7.4% increase as compared to 376.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales during the fourth quarter of 2014 were 194.9 million which improved sequentially as compared to 183.7 million in the third quarter of 2014. This quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by solid increase shipments of home standby generators which exceeded our expectations for the variety of reasons as discussed previously. In addition the current year fourth quarter benefited from higher organic portable generator shipments and the modest contribution from the Pramac acquisition that closed in early September, which is partially offset by a seasonal decline in power washers relative to the current year third quarter. Comparing on a year-over-year basis residential product sales declined slightly from the 199.1 million shipped during the fourth quarter of 2013 which was a strong prior year comparison that still benefited from the one year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2014 continued to experience a power outage severity environment that remained well below base line levels. These factors resulted in a modest year-over-year decline in both home standby and portable generator sales. However, in spite of the low outage environment we continue to see demand for home standby generators above our expectations for the quarter. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales increased 17.1% to 185 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 157.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The improvement was driven primarily by continued strong demand for mobile generators and light towers going into oil and gas and other general rental applications during the quarter. Contributions from the recent MAC acquisition also contributed to the year-over-year sales growth. These increases were partially offset by a continued decline in telecom shipments as compared to the prior year due to reduced capital spending by certain national account customers. On a sequential basis C&I product shipments improved compared to the third quarter of 2014 as we were able to ramp our operations in Oshkosh Wisconsin during the fourth quarter and return to normalize lead times for our larger industrial generators. As previously discussed the consolidation of our manufacturing footprint for these products took place in the third quarter of 2014 and resulted in the deferral of certain C&I shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014. Finally, although we have been experiencing a softer demand environment within Latin America over the past several quarters, shipments during the fourth quarter increased at a solid rate over the prior year as we believe the economic environment has stabilized in that region. Our other product sales category improved to 24.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 25.7% from prior year fourth quarter sales of 19.2 million. This growth is due to an increase in service part sales as the base of stationary and mobile products in the market continues to expand. To a lesser extent part sales from recent acquisitions also contributed to this growth. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.3% compared to 38.7% in the prior year fourth quarter. The decline was driven by the combination of a higher mix of organic C&I product shipments, the impact from recent acquisitions including Baldor, MAC and Pramac Americas and a temporary increase in certain products overhead related costs. During the fourth quarter, we incurred incremental cost associated with the West Coast port congestion, short-term transition costs related to the consolidation of our manufacturing and raw material storage footprints, manufacturing under absorption due to the reduction in telecom capital spending and copper forward contract mark-to-market adjustments. We expect these costs to continue into Q1 2015 and then moderate in Q2 2015. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 4.8 million or 8.9% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, the increase was driven by the addition of recent acquisitions, a more favorable adjustments to warrantee reserves in the fourth quarter of 2013 of 5.3 million as compared to the current year of 2.7 million, along with increased marketing and advertising expenses. These increases were partially offset by a 1 million reduction in amortization of intangible assets versus the prior year. Excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during the fourth quarter of ’14 were 13.4% as compared to 12.8% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was 92.2 million or 22.8% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 103.6 million or 27.5% of net sales in the same period last year. This decline in adjusted EBITDA margins compared to the prior year was attributable to the 4.4 decline in gross margins combined with the modest increase in operating expenses as a percent of net sales as a result of the factors just discussed. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2014 was 337.3 million or 23.1% of sales. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 49.4 million as compared to 48.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. GAAP income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2014 were 17.5 million or 26.1% tax rate as compared to 29.9 million or 38.2% tax rate for the prior year. The decline in GAAP tax rate was primarily due to the impact from certain state R&D tax credits that were recognized during the current year fourth quarter. Adjusted net income as defined in our earnings release was 68.4 million in the current year quarter versus 77.5 million in the prior year. This decline over the prior years is the result of the overall decline in operating earnings as previously discussed partially offset by 2.9 million in lower cash income taxes. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.70 for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $0.69 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconciled in our earnings release was $0.98 for the current year quarter compared to $1.11 per share in the prior year quarter. With regards to cash income taxes, the fourth quarter of 2014 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of 6.3 million as compared to 9.1 million in the prior year quarter. This year-over-year decline in cash income taxes for the quarter was primarily the result of a reduced cash income tax rate together with lower pre-tax earnings relative to prior year. The lower cash income tax rate wave was driven partly by the state R&D tax credits that were recognized during the current year quarter. For the full year of 2014, cash income tax rate increased to 13.3% as compared to 9.3% during the prior year due to our NOI carry forwards and certain tax credit carry forwards becoming fully utilized during 2013. Free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was 98.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 88.2 million in the same period last year. This record level of free cash flow was driven by a reduction in primary working capital compared to the prior year fourth quarter along with the reduction in cash taxes and capital expenditures partially offset by a decline in operating earnings during the current year quarter. Free cash flow for the full year 2014 was 218.3 million. Our uses of cash during 2014 included 34.7 million for capital expenditures, 61.2 million related to acquisitions and 87 million for the prepayment of term loan debt, including a $25 million payment during the current year fourth quarter. This debt repayment will be applied against our 2015 excess cash full payment that is required pursing to our term loan credit facility. As of December 31, 2014 we had a total of 1.09 billion of outstanding debt net of un-amortized original issue discount and 189.8 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on-hand resulting in consolidated net debt of 898.3 million. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITA leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter 2014 was 2.7 times a level that remains within our targeted range of two to three times. Additionally at the end of 2014 there was approximately 150 million available on our ABL revolving credit facility. Given our current liquidity profile and strong free cash flow generation, we're confident in our ability to continue to invest in the future growth for the business both organically and through acquisitions. With that I'd now like to turn the call back to Aaron to provide comments on our 2015 outlook.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks York. Today we are initiating guidance for full year 2015 as we expect net sales to increase in the low to mid single-digit range as compared to the prior year. Importantly this top-line outlook assumes no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment and no major power outage events during 2015. But does assume a more normalized baseline level of power outage activity severity relative to the below normal levels experienced in the prior year. We expect the seasonality of quarterly results to demonstrate a normal historical pattern assuming no major power outage events occur throughout the year. As a result we currently expect the first half of the year to represent approximately 44% to 46% of total sales and the second half to represent approximately 54% to 56% of sales. We anticipate that the first quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter of the year and to be in the range of $315 million to $325 million as we expect a normal seasonality, a subdued level of investment in the telecom market and sequential declines in oil and gas will all have an impact on the quarter. Looking at our guidance by product class, for residential products we expect net sales to increase in the mid to high single-digit range during 2015 which assumes mid single-digit organic growth with the balance of growth attributed to Pramac Americas acquisition. This sales growth guidance is driven by a number of factors including the execution on a number of strategic initiatives to increase the awareness and demand from standby generators, the assumption of a more normalized baseline level of power outage severity during 2015, and an overall favorable environment for a residential investment. The strategic initiatives we are working on including expanded focus on lead generation and further improvement in lead conversion for home standby generators increased to improve retail shelf placement of products, the full year benefit of new product launches and the expansion of participation by our dealers and various programs such as PowerPlay and PowerPro among others. With regards to our commercial and industrial products for 2015 we expect net sales to be down slightly on an as reported basis but flat on a constant currency basis. As strong headwinds in the oil and gas and telecom markets will be offset by gains in our industrial distribution channel, improvements in Latin America and contributions from the MAC acquisition. Organic C&I growth is expected to be down in the mid single-digit range. Our 2015 outlook for C&I products is driven by the expectation of a favorable non-residential construction market, the continued secular ships in the market to our natural gas generators used in light commercial and oil and gas applications as well as a general preference towards the rental of mobile power equipment. However we expect that telecom capital spending environment to remain subdued throughout 2015 particularly during the first half of the year. In addition as discussed earlier in the call the significant decline in oil and gas prices experienced over the past several months is expected to have a notable impact on demand for our mobile equipment that is primarily used in upstream oil and gas applications. We also expect a modest level of foreign currency headwinds from the stronger dollar particularly against the euro. Partially offsetting these headwinds is the expectation for Ottomotores to experience an improvement in larger project bid activity despite modest overall economic growth in the Latin American region driven by improved infrastructure spending and execution on strategic initiatives. In addition we expect to see further progress on our efforts to gain share in the larger end of the power generation market, continued optimization of our industrial dealer network and various initiatives to improve our specification and close rates. In summarizing our sales growth assumptions for 2015 we expect total organic growth to be flat compared to the prior year despite the strong headwinds from declines in the oil and gas and telecom sectors, as well as negative impacts from currency. The acquisitions of Pramac Americas and MAC are expected to contribute approximately 3% growth for a total year-over-year net sales increase in the low to mid single-digit range. Gross margins for 2015 are expected to improve by approximately 150 to 175 basis points as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to a reduction in product cost and more favorable pricing environment driven by a lower level of promotional activities as well as improved product mix partially offset by the full year impact of the Pramac America and MAC acquisitions. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding amortization of intangibles are expected to increase approximately 75 to 100 basis points as compared to 2014. This increase is due to a combination of higher warranty expense resulting from 5.1 million in favorable adjustments to warranty reserves in 2014 that are not expected to repeat in 2015 and increase in certain compensation costs and additional headcount to support strategic initiatives, as well as higher marketing and advertising expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to remain attractive and be in a range of 23.5% to 24% and are expected to experience some variation as a result of normal seasonality. Second half 2015 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 300 basis points higher than the first half as a result of additional SG&A leverage on higher sales volumes and more favorable product mix and increasing benefit from product cost reductions. Specifically regarding the first quarter of 2015 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 21% and then improve each quarter sequentially throughout the year. I will now turn it back over to York to walk through some guidance items to help model out our cash flows and earnings per share for 2015.
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Finishing up in 2015 we expect interest expense to be in the range of 47 million to 48 million which represents a similar level compared to 47.2 million for the prior year given a full year impact of our interest rate swaps that were entered into during 2014. The forecast for interest expense includes to 40 million to 41 million of cash outflow for debt service costs plus approximately 7 million for deferred financing cost and original issue discount amortization for our credit facility. The interest expense guidance assumes no additional debt repayment during 2015, our existing interest rate swap contracts remain in place and that LIBOR rates do not increase beyond our current LIBOR floor of 0.75%. Based on our guidance provided for 2015 our cash income taxes for the year expected to be approximately to $47 million to $49 million which translates into an anticipated full year 2015 cash income tax rate of approximately 18%. This represents a notable increase as compared to 34.3 million for cash income taxes in 2014 or a 13.3% rate. The projected increase in cash income taxes in 2015 is primarily due to expected higher overall pre-tax profitability levels and to a lesser extent less of a benefit from certain discreet tax deductions that were taken in 2014 and are not expected to repeat in 2015. The projected higher cash income tax rate is a function of the expected increase in pre-tax profitability levels as each incremental dollar of pre-tax profits over our tax shield is taxed at the expected GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36%. It is important to note however even though we're paying increasing levels of income taxes our favorable tax shield through annual and tangible asset amortization and our tax return remains intact through 2021 resulting in approximately 49 million of cash tax savings per year for the next seven years. As a result our cash income tax rate is expected to be significantly lower than our current projected GAAP income tax rate for the foreseeable future. As we drive higher profitability overtime cash income taxes can be estimated by applying a projected GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% on pre-tax profits going forward and then deducting the approximately 49 million of annual cash tax savings from the tax shied each year through 2021. Depreciation expense in 2015 is forecasted to be approximately 16 million to 16.5 million. GAAP intangible amortization expense in 2015 is expected to be approximately 21.5 million to 22 million. In 2015 stock compensation expense is expected to decline to approximately 10 million to 10.5 million primarily the result of the remaining unvested equity gain in France related to the 2010 initial public offering becoming fully vested. Finally in 2015 our capital expenditure spending is forecasted to increase to approximately $36 million to $37 million which is still less than 2.5% of our forecasted net sales for the year. As we continue to invest in certain infrastructure and technology expansion projects to drive organic growth and build a common global platform across our businesses. We expect to continue generating significant free cash flow in 2015 given our superior margin profile together with our low cost of debt, favorable tax attributes and capital efficient operating model. For full year 2015 we expect the conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow to be approximately 90% resulting in improved levels over the prior year. In closing this morning our Powering Ahead strategy has been guiding our investments in Generac for the last four years allowing us to capitalize on the compelling secular growth drivers for our business and contributing to the evolution of Generac into a more diverse and globally focused company. As we continue to move the Powering Ahead plan into the future, we're focused on a number of initiatives that are driven by the same four key objectives to grow the residential home standby generator market, gain commercial industrial market share, diversify our end-markets and expand into new geographies. Combining this strategy with the long-term growth opportunities of our business we believe Generac is well positioned to drive future growth and shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks, at this time we would like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Yourfirst question comes from the line of Jerry Revich representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you gentlemen could talk about what surprised to the upside in the quarter top-line, I think was better than your guidance and I think better than most of us expected. Relative to your expectations, can you talk about what went better?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think Jerry when we pull it apart as we mentioned home standby I think was probably the biggest part of the upside surprise for us during the quarter. We saw really strong activation rates which are installations, which is the lagging indicator for us just as to point out, but installations were strong throughout the balance of the fourth quarter and the seasonality in this category continues to surprise us a little bit. I mean we obviously were thinking a little bit stronger for third quarter than we ended up and not quite strong in the fourth quarter, so we continue to kind of learn the cadence of this market and especially in years without any kind of major events and even without any minor events frankly we didn’t have much in the way of outage events at all. So home standby was good, we attribute most of that increase in home standby by the way to as we kind of feel it apart to a lot of the additional spending that we’ve been doing on targeted advertising to particular the Power You Control infomercial that we’ve been running, the balance of 2014 in a lot of markets. We really ramped that up in the second half of the year and our PowerPlay selling app in concert with that, so we’re driving leads and driving those leads through distribution through our selling system and that really has picked up and we saw that start to accelerate in the third quarter and really do quite well for us in the fourth quarter in terms of the results of activation. So it’s driven home standby and then I think to a lesser degree the Magnum business, our Magnum business had a great year last year fourth quarter was actually was record year for Magnum in all of 2014, in the three years we’ve owned it and they had a very strong fourth quarter as well again going in the oil and gas markets in particular we saw particular strength there. We try to tamper out enthusiasm about where that’s going to go here in ’15 as oil prices have come down, but and then actually in Latin America we had a good quarter. And at Ottomotores we think we found a bottom there throughout the year in 2014 we’ve made some significant changes and investments in that business over the last several quarters, put some of the leadership in, done some things to consolidate our operating footprint and done some things down there that we feel are going to be an important catalyst for future growth and we also saw -- I think the market in Mexico has somewhat settled out as well. So we’re going to see what that brings for 2014 with oil prices being down, but we did have a good quarter in the fourth. So those are the things I would think that I would point out.
Jerry Revich: Can you talk about how the lead generation numbers look for you heading into the first quarter? You mentioned seasonality has been less of a factor for the standby business in the fourth quarter. We're looking at a pretty easy compare in the first quarter in the year-ago -- any color you can give us on what lead generation tells you and how we should think about standby seasonality ’15 compared to what we saw in ’14?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, when you look at the seasonality of this business when it gets cold and when it snows, installations activations really slow down. I mean in particular we’ve got some very strong markets in the Midwest and Northeast which have over the last several weeks been pounded with winter kind of finally arriving, so that has dampened installation and activation activity. Similar to what we saw last year in Q1 relative to the polar vortex which was more cold-driven but this year it is probably a little more snow driven. And then unfortunately those events haven’t led to any kind of major outrages, so I mean I guess if you’re in those areas that’s a fortunate thing but if you’re selling generators not so much. So what we’ve seen is that comedown, we think that our guidance that we issued here the kind of discreet guidance for Q1 kind of take all of that in the consideration and as reflective of at that point of our expectations here and where things are going to end up.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond representing KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Jeff Hammond: So it sounds like you want to wait on the size in the oil and gas opportunity. But if you can -- you've done a number of deals. Can we size what you think your oil and gas exposure is overall as a percentage of your sales, and maybe while you're at it, touch on telecom? And then can you talk about order rates within the different components of the business -- the heaters, the lighting towers, the gaseous generators, and where you are seeing or expect to see the greatest weakness?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes so I think you’re right, Jeff, we kind of pulled back on quantifying the oil and gas opportunity given the kind of rapid decline in energy prices here, but when we look at 2014 to kind of answer your question. And again it’s not a perfect number because when you sell to a rental equipment company you’re not exactly sure where the equipment ends up in terms of application and in terms of end application and it could be in one application one day and then the next week it’s in a different application. So it’s a little bit kind of tough but we can look at the general geographies that we’re shipping into and kind of make a guess there and as you could guess and so we think about 10% of our revenues top-line last year where kind of in that oil and gas space if you will, and that’s everything from the heaters. And again we didn’t have a full year of the MAC business under our belt so that’s not a pro forma number that would be on an as reported basis, so that might consider that up a bit from there when you think about MAC in a full year run rate. But obviously that’s going to pull back this year from that level and we think that our guidance is modeling that appropriately we have model a pretty fair headwind here for oil and gas. And then the other one as you mentioned is telecom, there was a point in the curve here earlier this year where we saw telecom start to come down we had a very good first half of 2014 for telecom so we've got a tough compeer up against there as we come into '15. But in the second half we really saw that come down we attributed that primarily to a couple of things I mean first as the cyclical business but secondly there were some major M&A activities that were announced in that space and we've seen that movie before where and we do a consolidation like that in the industry typically equipment purchases kind of slowdown as the acquired companies or the acquiring companies evaluate what they bought in terms of footprint and equipment. What's happened now is I think it's going beyond that I think the net neutrality discussion that’s out there some of the customers that we sell to directly in that space have been very clear and their remarks, their public remarks about capital spending as it relates to building out their networks. As this net neutrality the new rules kind of developed here with the SEC so it's kind of a wait and see, we think we’ve modeled a very subdued 2015 as it relates to telecom capital investment. So I think we're appropriately reflecting kind of how we see the market playing out there is still a lot of opportunities there don’t get me wrong it's not like it's gone to zero but it's certainly off of its pace from the first half of last year. And then I think when you look at what pieces of equipment in general we see as kind of get an impact by all these to answer your question I mean it's the mobile equipment business primarily as it relates to oil and gas and then the telecom business is more stationary diesel sets smaller stationary of diesel sets that are primarily delivered to those markets. And that’s hurting us as we mentioned on the small stationary diesel sets we had some absorption issues that we were up against in Q4 we are doing some consolidation of our operating footprint we continue those projects here in the first quarter. But that’s kind of lot of volume if you will in terms of a unit basis running through our factories here those stationary diesel sets for like the telecom market. So that again we think we reflect in our guidance kind of appropriate hedge against the fact that we could be faced with some absorption headwinds here first quarter and kind of maybe relaxing a little bit further in the year as volume builds.
Jeff Hammond: Can you give us a sense of within your commercial guidance, how much you are thinking telecom and oil and gas are going to be down?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes I think when we look at the headwinds I think we kind of modeling somewhere in that $50 million range if you want to think it that way is kind of the number we put on I mean again it's not a perfect science. But we think that that is reflective of kind of what we're going to see in the market here for 2015 that kind of a pullback no goals obviously yes but a 20% decline over prior year when you look at those two oil and gas and telecom.
Jeff Hammond: And then just on the cost side, can you quantify what this port issue cost you and when that resolves itself and then the added marketing spend? And do you think that persists through ’15?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes the port issue is amazing I mean we have had a lot of great planning earlier in the year in 2014 around that we saw it coming we're ordering inventory spending lead times on our ordering windows and talking about supply chain and that’s gone nine months. So even the best laid plans unfortunately didn’t anticipate to nine months kind of stretch on this what is turning to a freaking nightmare for -- I got to imagine I saw retail federation obviously getting things on retail store shelves but obviously in the manufacturing sector and other sectors in the economy we all depend on a global supply chain a lot of that global supply chain comes through what goes ports. We haven’t really quantified the amount but it is a little hard to quantify maybe we can look at airplane cost and everything else and that’s easy to put a number on but it's really the impacted disruption that’s going on in our business when you're trying to run products down in production line and you run out of one component and you've got to shift to a different production there is switching cost and there is -- you sending people home some days early you're working overtime other days to catch up. So it's a general disruption in the business from a resolution standpoint I think what I've heard is that there is hope that they're closed on arrangement here some kind of a contract but that it could take six to eight weeks to kind of unwind there are 25 ships at anchor out in the West Coast just off of Long Beach and up and down the cost there is elevated levels of traffic that needs to be resolved so it has led to all kind of shortages and trucking chasses and rail shortage capacity and all kind of dislocations so it's been a mess and we're going to continue to manage it, but it’s been a mess.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran representing Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Mike Halloran: So just one quick follow-up on Jeff's question, are you guys assuming a -- that the second half of the year run rate on telecom is what just carries through ’15, or are you guys thinking, given all the headwinds you mentioned, a modest step down from the second half and that's more the normalized run rate?
Aaron Jagdfeld: We're actually modeling Mike kind of a modest increase in telecom throughout the year and some of the…
York Ragen: In the second half.
Aaron Jagdfeld: In the second half of 2015…
Mike Halloran: Aaron, I meant relative to the back half of 2014 run rate that you saw?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, probably up slightly from that point Mike from the back half of '14 just when you look at the comp. So I guess our views on that -- there are some projects in the pipeline -- there are some potential customers that have told us about some plans but again I temper the enthusiasm around hey I think we have modeled it appropriately but just overall for the full year I think until some of the net neutrality stuff becomes a little clear I think these guys are a lot less inclined to continue to build out rate of their networks until they know where they things are going to head. 
York Ragen: Yes first half '15 looks slightly up from back half of '14 and then it build in into the second half.
Mike Halloran: Normal seasonality from that level then makes sense, so on the residential side of things, maybe just an update on the dealer count side of things and how you think that's tracking, what the pipeline there looks like. And then also how inventories for you guys track. I know you don't have a lot of standby inventory, but how the portable inventory bled through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter here.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So I will talk to dealer count one first before I get to inventories. Dealer count approximately 5,200 dealers is where we kind of are today and that say it's down from where we ended the year last year I think we ended the year about 5,400 so down a couple of 100 dealer on a net basis. Certainly not what we were expecting but given the challenging power outage environment it's not only difficult to create demand at the end-market level it's difficult to create interest at the distribution level. And so that comes off of three very large years of that we added over 1,000 dealers almost 1,100 dealers as a matter of fact in a three year period there two to three year period. So the count today is pretty stable, what we do like is that we see improvements in the engagement level of the dealers that we have in the channel. So even though the dealer count overall was down their engagement in the tools that we put in front of them with PowerPlay and PowerPro have really been effective. We just had our annual dealer meeting down in Orlando, Florida here in early January and we had 1,200 dealers at that meeting 1,300 dealers at that meeting and that's a record number for us and just a tremendous amount of interest in certainly new products which of course is always the life blood of distribution but the sales process and techniques that we're doing to make them more effective sales people. And the leads that we're driving them I mean we're driving tens of thousands and tens of thousands of leads these guys which is when you can get sales opportunities to distribution that's when you get a very close relationship going, so we're pretty pleased with that effort and focused very hard on that over the last several years. And then your question on inventory levels, you are right we don't keep a lot of standby inventory in our warehouses and because they are big heavy expensive boxes we don't see a lot that stays in channels. We would say that the standby inventory level is pretty normal where we were about a year ago in terms of channel levels by the end of the year. And then portable generator inventories are elevated I mean those are fourth quarter we just we were off I think I don't the record in our prepared remarks but our fourth quarter outages were 70 plus percent below kind of the normal baseline that we have been tracking. So fourth quarter was just really, really low and so I guess again it's what gives us some hope on the on standby side the things that we're doing are having an impact. I mean they are certainly overcoming the softness from kind of the macro softness that we're seeing in the end market. But portables are a different game I mean that was down again in 2014 down in 2013, so without some catalyst to propel those sales forward we were going to have elevated inventory levels for a while. We try to burn that stuff off over the next six to nine months that's kind of how we calibrate in terms of we kind of corporately set the inventory levels that are at a certain rate during the season like we did last fall. And then if you don't get a season then you are burdened with that inventory and the carrying cost of the inventory which is for us our carrying costs are relatively low so it's not a huge burden but we do have a lot of inventory.
Mike Halloran: And then on the tools that you guys are given, I think you cited about 25% of the people -- of your distribution is using some of these great tools you guys introduced. Maybe you can help frame how that's impacting the P&L from a growth perspective. What's that 25% seeing? And compare that to maybe the 75% or so that hasn't adopted amp, PowerPlay, and all of the other stuff? How would you differentiate what that looks like from a growth perspective and from a prospecting perspective?
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's a great question and these are things that we talk to dealers -- we try to move to the system -- we talk to them a lot about, right. We want to tell them how the 25% that are using this system how they are succeeding in terms of growth rates ahead of the 75% who don't use it. And we see double-digit increases in sales for the guys who are on the system and quite a bit less than that for people that aren’t. And so the leads don’t go to people unless they are on the system. So the leads that we generated you only get those as a dealer if you are part of the PowerPlay if you are using the PowerPlay system because the scheduling application is built in to that system. And so it creates a tremendous amount of alignment between ourselves and the dealers and the information flow coming back Mike the other way is really powerful as well in terms of just given us I mean dealer by dealer specific close rates and what their average quoted prices are so that we can help them try and sharpen their pencil when it comes to things that -- we see dealers from a best practice standpoint in one market that are closing sales at a certain percentage and we see dealers in other market at 2x that percentage, we want to take those best practices and we want to share them amongst the distribution. A lot of times we see a high correlation though between price points so the higher the price points that’s quoted out there the lower the close rate, so we see it’s directly inverse calculation. So our desire here is to not only get people on the system but to continue to reduce the total cost of ownership and we’re already focused very much on that next year, but we definitely see the difference in close rates and growth rates for dealers that are on the system versus the dealers that aren’t.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Charley Brady representing BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Charley Brady: So I just want to understand -- you've got essentially a flat dealer network, it sounds like, but you are seeing a pickup in Q4 sales. So can you give us any color on, I guess, maybe kind of the same-store sales for existing dealers? It sounds like, at least in Q4, maybe that's gotten better. But I don't know if there's just some seasonality around pretending you track that directly?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, we haven’t quoted the same-store sales number and we’re not to probably do that but from what drove this Charley I mean the -- again I think that we can point very clearly within our own data to the fact that the -- when we talk about what we’ve been doing on a sales and marketing side in terms of this four-step process right of driving awareness for the category is really critical and what we did and probably didn’t attribute enough value too in terms of our guide on fourth quarter was the fact that we were ramping our spending and our focus on this not only throughout all of 2014 but we really accelerated that in the second half, so we got the third quarter and there is a lag. It takes time when you start that spending you start those efforts in terms of a ramp on that for you to see it in the activations rate and the sales rate for the dealers and so what we saw which is we saw positive traction with that in the third quarter that led to improved shipment rates and activation rates for products in the fourth quarter. So if you want that mathematically yes that would lead to an improvement in the same-store sales just on the raw math basis across the average dealer. Certainly you know I think there are pockets also that we called out where -- there were even though activations or outages were very low and actually last year there were pockets where like the parts of the Midwest year Michigan in particular Eastern Canada again Toronto area and some parts of Canada where activation rates were particularly strong on the back of elevated outage activity on a localized basis in those market. And so if we didn’t get a lot outage but where we did get them where at couple of targeted few markets that ended up being and has historically frankly been good markets for us. The Midwest is going to be good market for us and it’s a market that doesn’t get Hurricanes, doesn’t get really ice storms. You get winter weather and you get some severe summer weather and that typically what drives that is as well as the tree cover here and the age of the grid in this part of the country. But even the northeast which, it wasn’t up in Q1, but it was certainly started to come back, very slow first three quarters of the year and then we saw the Northeast rebound very nicely for us in the fourth quarter in terms of stabilization and still down year-over-year on a comp basis based on the Sandy impact, but that region was up very nicely on a sequential basis for us in the quarter.
Charley Brady: And just on the commentary on your -- within your guidance, moving back towards normal outage activity -- again, in the guidance in 2015, I guess can you help us frame if we don't get back to that normal, what the top-line impact might be? Because we are down, what, 70%, and obviously, you're offsetting some of that, just internal stuff you're doing. So you're not getting the full brunt of it. But if we don't snap back to a normal 2015, what's the downside risk, I guess, is what I'm trying to drive to?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Charley, as you asked the question I think the challenge with that question, obviously when we project and forecast and put our budgets together all we have to go buy is its historical averages, so that’s why guide the way we do. Now having said that in answer to your question, if you look at 2014 we’ve been talking pretty clearly that that’s last year was a period pretty much every quarter where we had below average normalized baseline level of outages, so you can start with 2014. Look at our resi business for 2014, that’s a period of time that experienced below average outages so now you got a layer in Powermate, so we’ve acquired Powermate so there is some acquisitions growth and a modest acquisition growth from Powermate. And then to your point you got to give us some credit for all of our internal initiatives to drive awareness regardless of outages, we’re doing lots of things to really create our own awareness the sales and marketing and the tools and driving penetration of PowerPlay and getting our dealers aligned with us and all those things to drive growth regardless of outages. So you got to give us credit for, so you’ll be able to model a number then based on that and that gives you an idea sort of where -- what could 2015 look like with below average outages, now I think the other side of the coin is we haven’t assumed that in major outages either so there is upside to that as we get landed Hurricane and I know you’re trying to put a collar around it, but you have to keep that in mind as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Drab representing William Blair. Please proceed.
Brian Drab: So in the first quarter, you gave us the guidance -- this range of 315 million to 325 million. I don't know that you've given any granularity here in terms of what we should expect for the segments. But I guess from the call, what I would model here, what I'm gathering, is that maybe residential and portable is down a little bit year over year and a pretty steep decline in C&I year over year in the first quarter. Is that fair?
York Ragen: Yes that’s fair Brian I think Aaron mentioned we talked about seasonality of the residential business and with snow on the ground and very cold condition it is tough to install so seasonally historically Q1 is always got a lowest point in time for resi. So you would expect some moderation from Q4 to Q1 for resi but to your point about C&I there is some things on the C&I business that there is a still seasonality on the C&I business in particular what the mobile products. I mean there is just less construction in Q1 so therefore the mobile gens and mobile light towers seasonally will be off from Q4 to Q1. Our heater business, the heat business the season is Q3, Q4, Q1 comes around and in order rates drop fall off at that point. So that’s a seasonally thing, seasonally impact. But there is sequential decline in our guidance for oil and gas so we had a strong oil and gas quarter in Q4 we're expecting moderation off of that in Q1 for sequential decline oil and gas. Telecom year-over-year now for telecom that’s going to be a really tough comp Aaron mentioned we did ship a good amount of telecom product in the first step of '14. So year-over-year that’s going to be a tough one for C&I but I think we already comment about sequentially what telecom will look like and then there is the transition to moving our manufacturing footprints from Eagle to Oshkosh that did cause deferral sales aim from Q3 into Q4 that now that we've caught the normalize lead times that won't repeat in Q1. So that will be sort of an artificial sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. So I think the way you framed it Brian is quite right that C&I will be impacted more so sequentially.
Brian Drab: As we look at -- I guess the way I was framing it -- thanks for all that. But the way I was framing it was year over year as well. And I'm wanting to make sure that I am modeling down year over year for both of those segments, which is down more for C&I, is that fair?
York Ragen: I guess we haven’t given the street guidance but I think Jeff pointed out there was some easier comps with the polar vortex last year. But we still see that seasonal challenge with installation with lots on the snow on the ground and lots of cold. So I wouldn’t expect resi to be dramatically off that with prior year but C&I I think I gave my comments there.
Brian Drab: And then any impact recently from the winter storms that we are seeing on East Coast on the portable sales here in January?
York Ragen: No they're very minimal. So just have minimal outages associated with those storms there have been pockets but it's mostly just snow events. And I think from a portable gen standpoint, we really haven't seen much uptick.
Brian Drab: Okay. Then could you give us acquisition revenue in the quarter?
York Ragen: Yes so in the quarter so for C&I because it was up 17% a good junk of that the vast majority was acquisition related, so organic growth for C&I was in that low single-digit range. Now keep in mind that we had a very strong oil and gas organic growth and then but that was tempered by very tough comps on telecom so that’s really the reason for the sort of the muted organic growth on the C&I side of the business. So the majority of that 17% is in fact the MAC coming on board and actually one month of the Baldor business. And the on the resi side a very small amount where we reported minus 2% year over year are very small amount of that was related to the power made, so a little bit more negative from an organic standpoint for resi.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ross Gilardi: I was just wondering, can you help us at all with a more updated view of the geographic dealer network representation with everything that's going on over the last couple of years? You mentioned the strength in Eastern Canada and Midwest. Just -- and I know you don't fully disclose these numbers, but any help on Northeast versus the Midwest versus the Southeast that you could provide?
Aaron Jagdfeld: No. I don’t mean to -- we haven’t provided that a lot of detail Ross. The Northeast is obviously very strong region for us in terms of -- are you talking dealer account or you just talking…?
Ross Gilardi: Dealer account yes I am talking about the 5200 dealers like…
Aaron Jagdfeld: No we haven’t broken that, no.
Ross Gilardi: Okay.
Aaron Jagdfeld: I mean it follows population and outages, if you were to map if you were to overlay a U.S. map of population centers and outages you'd find a pretty…
York Ragen: Investor Relations deck has that map.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes I mean we have got a map and I mean we don't have the accounts broken out necessarily but…
York Ragen: But general trends…
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes we haven’t done it that way.
Ross Gilardi: You have been pretty clear on what happened with oil and gas in Q4 and what you expect earlier in the year. But can you kind of give any more color on what physically you are actually seeing with some of your rental customers? Because, clearly, they must have overbought in the fourth quarter and have got a lot of idle fleet to contend with in some of the energy-producing states. So are they now liquidating that fleet in the used market? Are they moving it around to other parts of the country just curious how that dynamic plays out. What physically unfolds that spills back into your business?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes I mean they watch utilization rates very closely in the rental market, right. I mean that's kind of their key metric in terms of the ROI and the equipment it's one of the key metrics as a number of them but utilization rate is the big one. So they are constantly dialing that in and obviously with the pull back in energy prices depending on some of the rental companies are definitely a lot more exposed to that than others. I would say generally the smaller regional players are the guys who are in the Bakken shale or in the Permian basins they are in the Eagle Ford shale I mean they are in the shale plays in the Marcellus directly those are the guys who are definitely having some challenges with idle equipment, right. But the big national accounts have a bigger footprint I think they have more flexibility to move things around. I can't tell you that I have heard directly that somehow there is bigger liquidations going on out there in the option markets and things like that. We do know the utilization rates have come down in the areas of the country that are in these direct energy play, so that’s definitely one. Now some of that thing offset by continued improvement around non-res construction, so non-res construction, road construction other non-res construction has been decent here has finally shown some signs of life which is helpful. But I think beyond that if you directly associated with especially rental type of company in the energy plays I think you are looking at some of the same things that we've modeled in terms of pull backs in oil and gas.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott representing Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.
Stanley Elliott: A quick question in North Dakota, there was a lot of push to run the generators right off of the wellhead. Have you seen any sort of regulatory moves in other shale plays to where that would be the norm going forward?
Aaron Jagdfeld: The Bakken is the place where flaring occurs most prevalently. So that’s been the concentration of regulatory environment both state level really at the local level, state level and the national level. EPA has got some stringent rules there state of North Dakota as you mentioned. Stanley it has also got some pretty strong rules that have been putting in there. When you get down in like the Permian Basin as an example I mean it's only about 3% of wells with flare so it's a much higher number in the Bakken and that's where we have seen early legislation some of these shale plays continue to develop like the Marcellus Southeast and some of the other parts of the country. I would suspect if and a lot of this is because of the type of drilling right it's frac -- it's frac drilling so that's where you tend to get more of that by-product from that is gas and gets flared off. The Bakken is primarily a frac type of environment in terms of the technique used. So where fracing is used more prevalently that's where you are going to see a general increase in flaring. And in particular in new shale plays like the Bakken -- the Permian is an older shale play it's pretty well developed so there are ways to actually capture that gas and put it into commerce clean it up and put in commerce do something else with it sell it or turn it into electricity or something like that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy representing Canaccord Genuity.
John Quealy: Hey, just real quick, on the new home builds, can you characterize them -- sorry, Aaron, if you gave it in your comments, but what penetration is like in the new home on the resi side right now?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I don't know that we've actually talked about that I mean the index is higher than our current 3.5% penetration rate across but we've said probably 2x is what we've seen it. I don't have a direct read in front of me on that John just in terms of like most updated stats for the quarter on that. But obviously it's a nice thing to see and we continue to make efforts there to -- we have put a lot of effort on that in fact with our sales teams here to bring new home builders in, we have had some wins in back half of 2014 in particular again some homebuilders who are doing whole developments with home standby generic heater as an option or as a standard feature on the homes that they are putting in and that’s something we haven't seen really ever. And so we like that and obviously it's in areas of the country we would expect to possibly see that like the Northeast and the Midwest where outages have been more prevalent in the last several years. But it is actually about 2x to kind of the overall penetration rate.
John Quealy: And just a real quick follow-up, just in terms of -- you have had some really good revenue growth and capture on, I call it, more of a centralized channel where you are helping these distributors close deals in homes. Is there a cost to capture from your standpoint at Generac that you measure? And would we likely see that number grow with national advertising, et cetera? It is still going to be pretty early innings for this effort, but I just wanted to get a feel on how you think about cost to capture from a Generac perspective? Thanks, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: It’s a great question, John, I mean we look at cost per lead that we generate, we look at the close rates and technically you work all way down to a cost per sale in terms of the efficacy of those efforts and not only the direct marketing spends if it’s direct mail, television, print those types of things but also we’re starting to look at the total cost to capture in terms of the efforts to produce those selling platforms, the efforts to improve selling platforms, the cost for the headcount that we need to take the leads, qualify the leads, and to push those leads out, training, the analyze -- we’ve got a massive effort going on. As you can imagine we’ve accumulated a tremendous amount of data over the last four years on activation data and we’re mining that data now at a level we’ve never done before we’ve brought analysts on board that are point through that data they’re trying to find queues in the data that help us sharpen our approach to our sales and marketing efforts so that we’re more targeted. So that we can keep those cost to capture in a relative range, but you’re right it’s early innings and we’re trying a lot of things right now, so the cost to capture is pretty high I mean thankfully our scale with 75% share gives us the opportunity that to really go after this hard and spend a lot of money on this. And you see it reflected in our SG&A, we’re spending millions and millions of dollars on these efforts and it’s not a small effort, but we think that we’ve got an opportunity here, a rate opportunity to take the market only 3.5% penetrated U.S. single-family homes and do something pretty unique in growing that. And that’s going to come from us it’s not going to come from anybody else in this market. We’re not going to sit around and wait Mother Nature to deliver the next catalyst for leg up in terms of demand we’re going to do it on our own. And when those outages happen we’re going to be in a really good stop in terms of being able to tell the story about these products and to capture those leads and close those leads. So we really like what we’re doing there. We think the payoff is well work the effort at this point, but it’s expensive.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Aaron Jagdfeld for closing remarks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks operator. We’d like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We appreciate the time. We look forward to our first quarter 2015 earnings release which we anticipate will be scheduled for sometime in late April. So it concludes the call. Thanks very much.

Operator:
York Ragen: We didn't hear the intro, so hopefully you can all hear us this morning. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings call. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and CEO. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today’s call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I’ll now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Third quarter net sales were $352 million as compared to $363 million in the third quarter of 2013, a decrease of $11 million or 3%. Our third quarter results reflect seasonally higher home standby sales that improved at a solid rate as compared to the second quarter of 2014 as we continue to build awareness and expand our leadership position in this product category. Also our C&I products continue to see some nice momentum with the oil and gas market as we experience some notable strength during the quarter from rental equipment customers in the U.S. Offsetting this strength however, was the continuation of a power outage environment that remained well below normalized levels and negatively impacted portable generator shipments and to a lesser degree, home standby generator sales. Additionally there were year-over-year reductions in capital spending with certain of our telecom customers during the quarter and the overall market softness we have experiencing this year within Latin America also continued in the quarter. As previously discussed on our last earnings call we monitor detail power outage activity internally and over the last seven quarters, outage severity has remained lower than lower historical base line levels. This extended low period of outages has significantly reduced demand for portable generators and has also resulted in moderating growth within the home standby market. In addition, the lower overall outage environment is slow, the expansion of our residential dealer base during the current year. Over our long history in this business, we've experienced power outage environments of running cycles. In the past few cycles, both above and below the baseline average have had the most immediate impact on our residential business. From a longer term perspective, we continue to expect the trend of an increasing level of power outages to remain in place, driven by an aging and underinvested electrical grid, favorable demographics and the frequency of severe weather that we believe will continue well into the future. That being said, we obviously can't predict the timing of power outage cycles. However, historical experience would suggest that we will return to the baseline level of outages in the future. That being said, we've worked hard to diversify Generac over the last several years through both organic efforts and acquisitions that have helped to reduce the impact from these outage cycles. As a result, while periods of reduced outages will have an effect on our business, it will be to a lesser degree in the future. Although the lower outage environment has negatively impacted demand for portable generators, we continue to see progress from our initiatives in the home standby market, which have proactively targeted likely buyers of these products over the last few years. Activation rates for home standby generators have proven to be resilient during the third quarter and thus far during the fourth quarter. This further reinforces our belief that permanently installed standby generators are an emerging product category as a backup power solution for homes, with an installed base that continues to grow. We also see increased awareness for this product category building as there were some encouraging regional growth trends experienced during the third quarter. Although the Northeast faced the strong prior year comparison from the afterglow Superstorm Sandy, there were other regions that experienced strong year-over-year growth such as the Midwest and Western regions of the U.S. as well in Canada. In Canada specifically, the major driver was within the Ontario province, which experienced some elevated power outage activity during the second half of 2013, including an ice storm that left over 300,000 utility customers without power for several days. Since that time we've seen our dealer count in the Toronto area nearly triple. We believe this represents yet one more example of an localized area experiencing a sustained power outage and which has led to a significant expansion of distribution in that market and ultimately will lead to a new and higher baseline of demand for our products in that region. While there hasn’t been a major broad base power outage event since Superstorm Sandy in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the overall power outage development has trend to well below normalized levels since that time, we are very encouraged by pockets of activity we see across the country that continue to drive the baseline demand for home standby generators. We're also intensely focused on a number of proactive growth initiatives to further increase the awareness of home standby generators. Through a combination of our unique sales and marketing tools, including our AMP targeted marketing process using advanced data analytics and our direct response television campaign along with our digital and traditional advertising efforts we've been successfully generating new sales opportunities for our residential dealers. These sales leads are directed to our Generac lead team for qualification and scheduling of an in-home consultation or an IHC as we refer to it through our PowerPlay in-home selling solution. Recall that many of these sales and marketing tools only became fully operational within the last two year and we have continuously improved them since their launch. As an example, our most recent version of our PowerPlay App, which will launch this month, has numerous improvements and functionality for our dealers. This includes a new proposal format that offers homeowners several options for their backup power needs allowing for a wider range of project budgets. Additionally, we recently integrated a new financing portal into PowerPlay that simplifies the qualification and extension of credit to homeowners. PowerPlay has become an important sales tool for our dealers, but it represents only one component of our broader selling system that we have delivered on and include several new and improved training programs designed to improve sales closure rates for our dealers using PowerPlay. With only approximately 3% of U.S. households owning a stationary backup generator, we believe there remains substantial opportunity to grow the residential standby category over the long term. Even though we currently are in a below average period for outages, we remain focused on building out and enhancing our competitive position within the portable generator market as we look to further solidify our leading position and providing a full range of backup power products to the residential market. Toward this goal, in early September we purchased the brands and assets of Pramac America, LLC, thereby acquiring the Powermate trade name for using certain residential engine power tools as well as the rights to license the DeWalt brand name for portable generators. Most notably this acquisition helps to expand our portable generator product offerings at both the consumer value into the market through the Powermate brand and for the premium contractor segment through the DeWalt brand. Sales of our commercial and industrial products during the third quarter benefitted from the contributions of recent acquisitions and continued strength in oil and gas markets. This was more than offset however by a decline in shipments to telecom national account customers as compared to the prior year, which was primarily the result of a reduction in capital spending by certain major customers in this vertical end market. As we have noted over the last several years, capital spending for our telecom national account customers can be somewhat cyclical, the variations from quarter to quarter and year to year. While we experience robust growth in shipments to telecom national account customers particularly in the second half of 2013, the current year has been more challenging as certain customers have decided to reduce capital spending for generators in the back half of 2014. In spite of these recent reductions, we continue to believe the long term secular penetration opportunity for backup generators at cell tower sites remains firmly in place due to the need for wireless providers to protect their revenue streams as well as the increasing competitive and regulatory pressures they face to harden their networks. As only 30% to 35% penetration of generators on cell tower sites, we believe there is a significant runway to continue to penetrate this sector as the leader in this vertical end market. Our Ottomotores business, which is based in Mexico and also has an operation in Brazil continues to experience a softer demand environment, primarily due to tepid economic growth throughout Latin America, which has led to reduced infrastructure spending in the region. Although the market has been recently challenging, we've been making good progress on our integration efforts with Ottomotores and we continue to believe this will be an essential platform for our international expansion efforts by providing a local manufacturing presence and access to the important Latin American market for power generation and other engine powered equipment. During the third quarter, we continue to see some notable strength from rental equipment customers in the U.S. both as a result of strong demand in the oil and gas market and a continued pick up in non-residential construction activity. As we've been discussing in recent quarters, we're particularly excited about the increased exposure of the oil and gas market that the combined Baldor and Magnum acquisitions have given us. Through these companies we now have a broad product line of mobile and stationary equipment including gaseous fuel generators that are capable of running on wellhead gas generated at drilling and production sites. Advances in drilling techniques over the past several years have led to significant increases in shale oil and gas production, which we believe is poised to continue over the longer term. This creates an attractive secular opportunity for both mobile and stationary power equipment demand including the need for support equipment such as light towers, generators and pumps that are essential at these drilling and production sites. In addition the regulatory environment around the flaring of natural gas extraction sites has been a catalyst for increasing demand for gaseous fuel generators. We're making solid progress in further evaluating the overall opportunity in oil and gas to better determine the appropriate levels of investment and resources needed as we position ourselves to participate in this potential long-term up cycle. Part of this assessment is included in analysis of other engine powered products that are used by customers within the oil and gas market. And with that analysis in mind, we recently announced the acquisition of a MAC heater company in Bismarck, North Dakota. MAC is a leading manufacturer of premium grade commercial and industrial mobile heaters within the U.S. and Canada and offers a broad product line that includes flameless, indirect-fired and hydronic surface heaters ranging in size from 200,000 BTUs to 4.2 million BTUs per hour. These products are primarily used in the oil and gas and construction markets as well as other industrial sectors and are primarily sold through national equipment rental companies and independent dealers. The addition of MAC provides immediate access to a diverse line of mobile heating equipment that is essential to colder climate oil and gas and construction sites. We're excited about the potential cross-selling opportunities this acquisition brings as we combine MAC heater product line with Magnum's broad relationships in the equipment rental market and allows us to further penetrate the oil and gas market. Lastly as it relates to C&I in the third quarter we began the consolidation and the manufacturing footprint for our larger industrial generators from our Eagle Wisconsin facility to the recently Baldor facility in Oshkosh Wisconsin. This transition resulted in the deferral of some shipments for certain products, which impacted our third quarter results modestly. We expect to complete the consolidation of these operations during the fourth quarter. With this project and with the increased demand for the product line acquired in the Baldor deal, we expect to see improved utilization of the Oshkosh facility on a go-forward basis. The additional capacity that Oshkosh provides, our industrial business is critical to our ability to aggressively pursue the larger end of the industrial generator market, a market we've largely not participated and prior to the Baldor acquisition. I would now like to turn the call back over to York to discuss third quarter results in more detail. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the third quarter of 2014 were $352.3 million as compared to $363.3 million in the third quarter of 2013, with the prior year benefiting from the continued afterglow period of demand from Superstorm Sandy as well as robust capital spending by certain telecom national account customers. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales during the third quarter of 2014 were $183.7 million, which improved as compared to $179.6 million in the second quarter of 2014. This sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by a solid increase in shipments of home standby generators. Partially offsetting the sequential increase was a normal seasonal decline in power washer sales as the second quarter tends to see elevated power washer sales given the spring clean season. Comparing on a year-over-year basis, residential product sales declined from the $192.7 million shipped during the third quarter of 2013 with a combination of factors leading to the decline. First, sales of residential products in the prior year third quarter were still benefitting from the afterglow demand from Superstorm Sandy, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012. As we have previously indicated, the afterglow demand from major outage events can last for several quarters with the anniversary of the event creating increased awareness as well. In the case of Superstorm Sandy, this afterglow demand was significant throughout 2013. In addition, the third quarter of 2014 continue to experience a power outage environment that remained well below baseline levels. This is now seven quarters in a row where power outages have been below average. These factors resulted in a significant year-over-year percentage decline in portable generator sales and to a lesser extent a modest year-over-year percentage decline in shipments of home standby generators. Additionally during the current year quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Pramac America, LLC, which contributed only slightly to shipments of residential products during the period as it closed on September 1 and given its relatively small size. Looking at our Commercial & Industrial products, net sales for the third quarter of 2014 were $146.4 million as compared to $151.5 million in the prior year quarter. The decline in C&I net sales was driven primarily by the timing of shipments to certain telecom national account customers. During the prior year third quarter we shipped a significant amount of product to a major telecom customer as they continue to invest in hardening their wireless network. During the current year third quarter that same customer reduced their capital spending on generators resulting in a significant year-over-year decline in sales. As we have previously discussed, the timing of shipments for our telecom national account customers can vary from quarter to quarter or year to year. The decline in telecom shipments was partially offset by the acquisitions of Baldor Generators which closed in November 2013 and Tower Light which closed in August 2013. Additionally, strength in oil & gas markets has resulted in significant demand for our mobile products as increased utilization of this equipment at oil & gas extraction sites has driven significant orders from our broad rental customer base. Our other product sales category improved to $22.1 million in the third quarter 2014 as compared to $19.1 million in the prior year. This growth is due to an increase in service part sales as the base of our stationary and mobile products in the market continues to grow. To a lesser extent parts sales from recent acquisitions also contributed to this growth. Gross margins for the third quarter was 37% compared to 38.4% in the prior year third quarter. Gross margin was predominantly impacted by increased promotional activities during the current year quarter along with the sales mix impact from recent acquisitions including Baldor, Powermate and Tower Light. These declines were partially offset by our higher sales mix of home standby generators and a lower mix of telecom C&I product sales. Operating expenses for the third quarter 2014 increased $7.3 million or 14% as compared to the third quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily driven by $5.6 million favorable adjustment to warrantee reserves in the third quarter of 2013 that did not repeat in the current year. Increased marketing and advertising expenses over the prior year quarter and the addition of operating expenses associated with the recent acquisitions were partially offset by $1.7 million reduction in amortization of intangible assets versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $83.1 million or 23.6% of net sales in the third quarter of 2014, as compared to $100.1 million or 27.5% of net sales in the same period last year. This decline in adjusted EBITDA margins compared to prior year was attributable to the 1.4% decline in gross margins combined with an increase in operating expenses as a percent of net sales as a result of the factors just discussed. Most notably the $5.6 million favorable warrantee reserve reversal in Q3 2013 that did not repeat in the current year. Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months as of September 30, 2014 was $348.7 million or 24.3% of net sales. GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2014 was $36.5 million, as compared to $47.1 million for the third quarter of 2013. Adjusted net income as defined in our earnings release was $57.9 million in the current year quarter versus $73.7 million in the prior year third-quarter. This decline over the prior year as a result of the overall decline in operating earnings as previously discussed, partially offset by $3 million in lower cash income taxes. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.52 in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $0.67 per share in the third quarter of 2013. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconciled in our earnings release was $0.83 for the current year quarter compared to $1.6 per share in the prior year quarter. With regards to cash income taxes, the third quarter of 2014 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $6.5 million as compared to $9.5 million in the prior year quarter. This year-over-year decline in cash income taxes was primarily the result of a reduced cash income tax rate expectation, together with lower pretax earnings relative to the prior year. Our cash income tax rate for the full year 2014 is now anticipated to approximately be 14% versus our previous expectation of a range of 17% to 18%, primarily due to the reduced full-year outlook and to a lesser extent a higher level of benefit from certain tax credits from previously expected. Although cash income taxes declined during the current year quarter, year-to-date cash income tax expense for the third quarter of 2014 increase to $28 million as compared to $16.7 million in the comparable prior year period. As we have commented during recent earnings calls, our cash income taxes for full-year 2014 are expected to increase over the prior year due to a combination of NOL carry-forwards and certain tax credit carry-forwards becoming fully utilized during 2013 as well as certain discrete tax deductions that were taken in 2013 that will not repeat in 2014. As a reminder, even though we are paying increasing levels of income taxes our favorable tax shield through annual intangible asset amortization in our tax return remains intact to 2021 resulting in approximately $49 million of cash-back savings per year for the next eight years. As a result, our cash income tax rate is expected be significantly lower than our currently projected 32% to 33% GAAP income tax rate in 2014. As we drive higher profitability over time cash income taxes can be estimated by applying a projected longer-term GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% on pretax profits going forward and then deducting the approximately $49 million of annual cash-back savings from the tax shield each year through 2021. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $47.8 million in the third quarter of 2014 as compared to $76.7 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year declined was the result of a decline in operating earnings during the current year quarter and increasing capital expenditures over the prior year and increase in cash interest paid due to the timing of required interest payments in the prior year third quarter relating to the credit agreement refinancing completed in May 2013. Free cash flow over the last 12 months was $208 million. With regards to the primary working capital the Powermate America acquisition which closed on September 1, 2014 added approximately $18 million of primary working capital to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2014. As we mentioned in our earnings release this morning, we made a voluntary prepayment of debt during the third quarter of 2014 totaling $50 million which will be applied against our 2015 excess cash flow payment that is required pursuant to our term loan credit facility. Because this excess cash flow payment would have been required in 2015 we decided to capture the benefit of the lower interest expense earlier by prepaying a material portion of the anticipated payment in the third quarter. The $50 million debt prepayment made during the quarter resulted in the recording of a $1.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt which is included within other income expense on the income statement. Updating our interest expense guidance, our cash service costs are now projected to be approximately $41 million for the full year 2014 while amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount is now expected to be approximately $7 million during the year, for a full-year 2014 GAAP interest expense totaled approximately $48 million. As of September 30, 2014 we had a total of $1.11 billion of outstanding debt net of unamortized original discount and $173.2 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand resulting in consolidated net sales of $938.9 million. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.7 times a level that remains within our targeted range of 2 to 3 times. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide additional comments on the remainder of 2014.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks York. We are revising our prior guidance this morning for 2014 in terms of revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margins. The revised guidance is primarily due to the assumption that the current power outage environment remaining below normalized levels, the continued reduction of capital spending with certain telecom customers and overall economic softness within Latin America. For the full year 2014 net sales are now expected to decline in the mid-single digit range over the prior year which compares to the previous expectation for net sales of an increase in the mid-single digit range. Shipments of residential products are expected to decline in the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 mainly due to a strong year prior comparison for home standby generators. This is primarily the result of the prior year fourth quarter including the one-year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy which drove a higher level of awareness and demand from standby generators. Shipments of Commercial and Industrial products are expected to increase during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to the prior year. This increase is primarily the result of recent acquisitions as well as the completion of the Oshkosh facility consolidation partially offset by a continued year-over-year reduction in telecom shipments. In summarizing our sales growth assumptions for 2014 excluding the impact of the $140 million headwind related to the first half 2013 production ramp in residential products and normalized lead times, we now expect total organic year-over-year growth to be approximately flat. This expectation of flat organic growth on an adjusted basis represents the holding of the new and higher baseline demand for full year 2014 following a very strong period from 2011 to 2013 where compounded annual growth exceeded 25%. Equally important, the holding of this baseline level is occurring with the backdrop of a softer demand environment in certain of our end markets during 2014 as we previously discussed. With regards to gross margins, were are expecting an approximately 150 basis point decline sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of a higher mix of C&I product sales partially offset by price cost improvements expected during the quarter. We are also revising our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for full year 2014 to now be in the low to mid 20% range as compared to the previous margin expectation of the mid 20% range. Adjusted EBITDA margins specifically during the fourth quarter of 2014 are now expected to decline approximately 50 basis points on a sequential basis as compared to the third quarter. We expect that we’ll continue to generate significant free cash flow in 2014, given our strong margin profile, low cost of debt, favorable tax attributes and a capital efficient operating model. In closing this morning, although certain of our end markets are performing below our expectations we remain focused on the numerous compelling secular growth opportunities for our products. We continue to believe that a substantial penetration opportunity exists for residential and like commercial standby generators, and we are encouraged by the strong momentum we are seeing in the oil & gas markets. Longer term, we are also optimistic about the increasing need for our products used in certain end market verticals, such as telecommunications and data as well as the opportunity to increase our share of the C&I markets through our recently expanded product offering. In addition, we believe the overall secular shifts in the market through our natural gas generators and the rental of mobile power equipment remain in place. With our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation profile, we are confident in our ability to continue to investment in the future growth of the business, both organically and through acquisitions. In doing this, we expect to benefit from being a more balanced and globally focused company as we further implement our diversification and international expansion strategies. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning and at this time we’d like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Please standby for your first question which is from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America: Yeah, good morning, thanks guys, just a couple of questions. First of all on your inventories, I mean it looked like they’re up 11% year-on-year on a 3% sales decline and it looked high relative to the last several years as a percent of sales. Maybe some of this is acquisitions, but I wonder if you can flush that out, specifically why your inventories elevated when a lot of your main products are made-to-order products and if we assume no further deterioration in the market, how long will it take you to get inventories back in the balance and what will you cost you on margin into 2015?
York Ragen: Yeah, this is York, yeah I mean that one, or about half of that increase in fact is acquisition related with the Powermate acquisition that came some portal inventory with that acquisition. I think I highlighted at least primary working capitalized was $18 million that came with that acquisition and a chunk of that was inventory. And then the other half is effectively us bringing in portable generators for the Generac portable season. Unfortunately, we didn’t have a season as we highlighted there weren’t you know outages have remained below average so that’s…
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, this happens you know Ross, I mean the cadence with that side of the business is you build for the season and the same situation played out last year. I mean, we had elevated levels on portables. It takes us about you know anywhere from kind of six to nine months to burn that inventory down. We do it on an everyday basis. We don’t discount portable generators. That’s not you know you don’t know when an event is going to happen, so there’s no point in discounting portable gen’s because frankly the carrying costs for those products is you know the economic model there would tell you that discounting those products doesn’t make a lot of sense. Yeah, as it relates to some of the other inventory categories, home standby inventories actually internally here you know we, our activation rates as we noted on the call this morning have been quite strong third quarter and here into the fourth quarter already. And the momentum in that business even in spite of the lower power outage environment you know there’s kind of two seasons there. There’s the summer storm season and then you've got winter storms that kind of create elevated demand for these products over time and we’re actually kind of ramping production right now on the home standby side as we go into the fourth quarter as we’re in the fourth quarter here for that that kind of second season. So you know we would tell you that inventory levels that mix as it relates to those products is definitely in range with where we’d expect it to be at this point in the cycle.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America: That’s presumably for your inventories Aaron, but do you feel like there is excess inventory in the dealer chain at all and do dealers have the flexibility to push any excess standby inventory that might have crept in there as a result of promotional activity back to Generac?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, you know the dealer, so dealer channel historically does not -- it's not a stocking channel for us. We do have obviously if you take you got 5,000 dealers. So even if every two dealer took a unit or two, there would be a fair amount of product out there. And there is product in the field, but actually we look at that, we're able to tell very clearly exactly what’s in the field, because we know what we ship and we know when it gets activated. So frankly by every channel we know specifically what's in each channel and we know actually to skew level we know that. And we've seen some very nice improvement in home standby inventories over the last 120 days. Again the seasonal cadence there distribution and when they do take inventory, they take it ahead a season, which they did in the second quarter. We noted that and we've seen that come down even in spite of not having the major outages. So actually we think that we're in really good shape in terms of when we look at like kind of days on hand if you will as a turn, that statistic is coming down very nicely over the last 120 days.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America: Okay, thanks Aaron and then just I had a question on the balance sheet, you leverage I think now as a 2.7 times and if you move forward a quarter and take sort of your implied guidance for Q4, you're going to be right near three times and I believe you want to keep your leverage three times based on your credit agreement terms or you incur an increase in your cost of debt as I think you’ve made reference to that in prior call. So based on that, can we pretty much assume you won't be making any sizable acquisitions or returning any cash to shareholders in near future? Why you are hovering around that three times range or would you potential tolerate a modest bump in your cost to debt for the right transaction.
York Ragen: For the right transaction Ross, it's a quarter point right on the rate and it's already a very low cost structure in terms of the liability structure. So from an acquisition standpoint, we won’t let that kind of impinge our ability to do deals. For the right deal, we've said this before, our ability to service our debt it’s a very low in terms of total cash flow profile as a company. Even at three times frankly its -- if we were to go above that and the debt were to creep up and the cost of debt were to creep up a bit as a result of that, but I think in the absence of any acquisitions, obviously we would like to keep that multiple below three times just from a standpoint of not paying the extra interest. One of the reasons we took a proactive approach here at the end of the third quarter to pay down some debt simply because we want to take advantage of the lower -- why not get the interest savings in the fourth quarter so we made that decision.
Aaron Jagdfeld: The reality is we have that excess cash flow payment we were going to have to make anyway in 2015. So we just decided to take advantage of interest savings ahead of time.
York Ragen: I think our uses of cash priorities can remain intact. We are going to generate a lot of cash over time as well. As we talk about our strong free cash flow and our strong free cash yield we'll be able to generate a lot of cash as well. So I think prior uses of cash still remain intact in the order that we've always talked about in terms of organic growth and maintaining two to three times leverage and then M&A and then after all that then the Board would evaluate return of capital to shareholders.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America: Is it only a quarter, sorry to interrupt, is it only a quarter point on the rate up until say 3.25 times or what's the…
Aaron Jagdfeld : Only a quarter point that’s it regardless of anything above three.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America: Okay. Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Charley Brady from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets: A little bit of commentary on the promotional activity in the quarter. How much does that impact the sales in the quarter and if we had normal promotional activity because it sounds like it was elevated, sequentially would you still had growth in the standby generator sales and then I want to understand a bit better the commentary around strong activations, but standby sales being down?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes Charley from a promotional standpoint, obviously again the cycle in this business and again I am talking residential here, when you get into periods where this business is -- outages do matter in this business for generator company. So we tend to when you don’t see outage activity to the baseline level, we will tend to promote more obviously to try and stimulant end demand beyond that which the end markets not naturally doing through that baseline average. So in terms of -- I can't attribute to total dollars that we would are related to the promotional activity in the third quarter. We had promotional activity in the second quarter as well, which we called out. So my belief again peeling it back, we're not giving you the details, but it grew sequentially in both and so the second part of your question the activation rates we've said that there was inventory in the channel in the second quarter’s result of the preparation of the season and over the last 120 days, we've seen those turns improve in distribution. So there is a work down of some of that going on as activations have picked up. So you got a little bit of that that’s happening. There is also a lag -- the activations are after the sales happened. There is a period of time between when an in-home consultation is done to when the home owner decides to actually go forward with the purchase to when all the permits are issued on the job and the dealer orders from us and then to when the dealer actually puts the machine on the ground and activates it. So it is a bit of lagging indicator. So we would throw that out there to make sure that everybody is aware of that fact, but I would tell you that from just peer end and demand and what we see, we think that a lot of that's from our efforts on the proactive side and clearly it has to be because the outage environment has been very weak, more weak than we've seen it in a long time. We've seen cycles I've been with the company 20 years and we see cycles over that 20-year period. It's just -- that's how outages run. You run through periods of elevated outages and periods where you're below and that's just part of the business model. But I think the fact of the matter is that our proactive efforts today when I wind the clock back over my history with the company, we're doing so more today to stimulate end demand and defined the more likely buyers of these systems than we've ever done and we're using data to do that, which I think is really a critical advantage that we have is our market share improved during the quarter. We believe we were up to 75% share in the market today and we think that that improvement is coming purely from the standpoint that we've got more data at our fingertips to find the more likely buyers of these systems in spite of not really having the outages. So the advantage that we get in kind of down periods like this I think is exacerbated by the fact that we're using a lot more tools to our advantage much more so than anybody else in this industry could do at this point.
York Ragen: I’ll just add, you had mentioned year-over-year discussion and last year was still benefiting from the afterglow from Superstorm Sandy, there is, it was an event that had a long tail and even when you look at the one-year anniversary of that event that tail even did extend into Q4. So we've got that deal with as well.
Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets: Can you quantify the Sandy in the back half? You said 140 for the first half, but is there any numbers you can put around that?
York Ragen: The 140 is…
Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets: The 140 was really as the lead time is coming in when you get pass that, then how do you attribute purchase in November of 2013 to Hurricane Sandy in October of 2012, it's hard to like delineate that.
Aaron Jagdfeld: So we had a small localized outage and that was the second or third outage it had in a period of time. So attribution back to a particular event is almost impossible to do.
Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Just one more on the C&I side, can you quantify the deferred shipments in Q3 that are going to come back in Q4 and are they all coming back in Q4?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Oh, you're talking about the…
Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets: You stock got deferred, so are you consolidating the plan moving the plant.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We're not going to get all it back in the fourth quarter. There is a lot of it that's coming back. That was a big project to move everything and consolidate our footprint there and it's going to give us a great platform to work off of going forward, but it did come with some deferral of shipments here that -- and we're going to get a lot of that in the fourth quarter. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we had a modest impact on Q3 in terms of C&I but we'll get the lion's share of that back in the fourth quarter, but not 100% of it.
Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets: Thanks guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Thanks.
York Ragen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: Good morning.
York Ragen: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: Can you talk about where lead times stand now for your standby business and update us on the dealer count and you alluded to it in the opening remarks and also just as a follow-up what does your lead generation work suggest and volume will look like in the fourth quarter versus third quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So in terms of lead times Jerry, lead times are well within the zero to two weeks that we would normally see. Kind of off season if you will given the low environment that we have, although again with activations being elevated demand has been as we called out, sequentially more robust from Q2 to Q3. Dealer counts that’s been a challenging area for us. When you get periods in the cycle here like we're experiencing with lower outages we are having some difficulty signing up new dealers on a gross dealers count. There is some difficulty there, but that’s not really where the difficulty lies. The difficulty lies in what we refer to as dark doors, which is the dealers who don’t purchase in a 12-month period, where actually we take a pretty conservative view there. I don’t know how other companies do it, but we say that if a dealer hasn’t bought from us in 12 months, he goes dark and we take him out of the dealer count. Now in lot of cases those dealers don’t go away, they have just have bought in 12 months. So there is still officially quote unquote “dealers” for us but we just don’t include them in the count for the purposes of this call or for the way that we talk about distribution. If you get an event in an area and a dealer hadn’t bought in 15 months, we could see a reactivation of a dealer down the line. That count is down slightly here in the third quarter from the second quarter. Down around that kind of 5100 number from the 5200 that we were at the end of second quarter. That’s going to be a challenge for us for the balance of the year. I think we can end the year somewhere in that 5100 to 5200 number kind of hold that number through the rest of the year and we feel pretty good about that. As far as directionally into the fourth quarter, again I think we've called the fourth quarter contains a pretty difficult comp because as York mentioned a couple of times that the anniversary of Sandy, whenever you get the anniversary of a major event, that anniversary period as it relates to last year having happened in October of last year, creates additional awareness, creates additional generally a small surge in demand that happened. Sandy was a big event and had a fairly big anniversary event as a result in Q4 of last year. So we've got that comp that we were coming up again and so we called out that sequentially we're going to see some challenges there relative to that comp.
York Ragen: And our guidance assumes that outages stay below normal at the current rate coming into Q4 here.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And just to make sure if outages standby down sequentially obviously year-over-year is a really tough comp, but down sequentially as well as what you're looking for.
York Ragen: Resi and all, that's how we don’t break it how, but resi and all would be -- that would be the case based on the implied guidance.
Aaron Jagdfeld : And primarily as a result of that comp.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then, okay, thank you and then for C&I can you just update us on where your telecom customers are in the standby build-out on existing towers and it looks like are they taking a pause here or are they nearly through that process and just should we think about tough competitors through the first half of next year or is this is a timing issue in the back half of this year.
Aaron Jagdfeld : Yes, we’ll save our comments for next year on the next call because we're working through that and obviously trying to get some better visibility from those customers today on their plans for 2015, which they’ve not even necessarily declared to us at this point. So as the year rounds out, hopefully we'll get some better visibility. We call this out from time again Jerry that visibility in the telecom market for us even quarter-to-quarter year-to-year is difficult. Longer term we've serving this market for the better part of two decades. It's grown dramatically over that two decade period. The penetration rate being only 30% to 35% of total sell site out there and we estimate there is roughly 300,000 sites that are out there. So call it a couple 100,000 sites yet that don’t have back up power on them. We see tremendous runway either whether through regulatory pressure or just frankly the protection of the revenue streams that these customers have that valuable data revenue stream that goes through sites and the critical communication is going through these sites and we're the number one provider in this market. It's been a great market for us. We love those customers. We just unfortunately don’t get a lot of visibility in terms of just quarter to quarter. So our guidance in Q4 contemplates that will stay in a reduced capital spending environment here with those customers for the balance of year. Unfortunately that can turn on a dime. We've gotten calls where customers want to burn budgets before the end of the year and when I say customers, I am using a plurality there. It's really a single customer this year that's backed off their capital plans pretty aggressively and just working through their cycle and we expect longer term -- we expect that that will return to growth its just a question of when.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks.
York Ragen: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Halloran – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Good morning Aaron and York.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hi Mike. 
York Ragen: Hi Mike.
Michael Halloran – Robert W. Baird & Co.: So could you just talk a little bit about call to confidence in the base business here? It certainly seems like you're calling what you're seeing on the residential side to be a baseline on a forward basis and given the lack of storm activity or outage activity in this case maybe you just talk about the puts and takes that you're seeing on that that gives you the confidence that this is the right baseline to think about?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah I mean it is a great question Mike, and obviously we struggle internally ourselves to understand after each kind of elevated period we called out the compound annual growth rate of 25% from 2011 to 2013 and trying to figure out where that baseline comes in after that, these kind of cycles work through has always been a challenge in the business. And I think the one immutable truth in this business over my time with it is that there is a higher level of baseline demand that does become pronounced. It holds and figuring out where that hold is at you know I don’t know if we write a call that this is actually it. I feel like in the business given the activation data we're seeing, given the proactive approach that we've been taking and the things that we're doing to give our dealers and our distribution partners more success in the marketplace in terms of sales tools and the training. I mean just the sheer amount of effort that we're putting into that is really I think a pretty great testament. I think the one thing you know seven quarters of really reduced outages is not, it's just a, it sets the baseline and we think that this probably is a great point to say, hey this demand kind of that we're seeing right now, end demand that we're seeing right now would be the baseline. And so, we like where that's kind of settling out. You know it's just it's unfortunate that some of the other things in the business like on the scene aside with telecom and the softness in Latin America, all those things that kind of hit in one quarter which is regrettable. But you know, I mean some of that I would say but for maybe the consolidation of our manufacturing footprint which is certainly in our control, but you know even that is a project that just led to some deferral of some shipments. But everything else kind of just is lined up against us in the quarter and that's from our standpoint, the base business is very healthy. You look at oil & gas, you look at the rental markets, you look at natural gas generators. We like the recovery going on in the non res markets in C&I. All of those things are good things. You know we think the economic environment in the U.S. is firming up and that should portend to good things I think in the future. And outages will not stay low forever, I mean that's just there's a return to the baseline average at some point. It just is you know it is right now we're in a cycle where it's down. And it will come back and I've watched this business enough to know that when those things do come back they come back pretty aggressively and that's just how this business works.
Michael Halloran – Robert W. Baird & Co.: That's fair and that kind of gets to the next question here. I'm not asking you guys to print the guidance or anything like that, but when I think about next year and I think about the baseline level business today, and I think about the lack of outages that you've seen so far, you know maybe talk about the puts and takes and specifically stay on the residential side that could help actually see a return to growth in 2015. I mean it certainly seems based on the internal initiatives that you're seeing in the environment that that is a growth expectation from a portfolio perspective on a forward basis. I'm curious how you are looking at those puts and takes next year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, I mean, obviously we're working on next year's plan at this point and you know we'll be able to speak more discretely to that when we get into 2015. But I think just not in the initiatives, that kind of underpin that and certainly underpin what we're seeing this year, and my comments but also would underpin next year. I mean we've got some, you know, I talk, we talk about this data that we've got, I mean we've been collecting activation data now for four years. And the amount of data that we have is, I mean frankly it's staggering even by our standards. Well we've amassed in four years time in the outage data we've been tracking over that same four-year period and it's very detailed date. It's down to the household level, down to the DMA, we're down to zip codes and down to just some of the mining of that data, I think we've only been kind of superficial in our mining of that to date. We've got some pretty aggressive projects on the docket for next year to involve a lot more we will list some help frankly in analyzing that data at the level of depth that we haven’t to date to try and drive even further you know trying to find those proactive buyers and trying to get the right messages to the right people at the right time. I mean there’s some pretty amazing things that we think we can do with the data that we haven’t done yet. And so I’m excited just from that standpoint because I think it unlocks some potential there that’s not there, you know so that can be as pretty exciting. I think another area that we’ve been focused on is in the installation side of the equation with staying on the residential side again as you want to do. That installation component continuing the work to bring that installation cost down. We work very, very hard here to be very, I’ll call value based when it comes to the product in terms of whether it be home standby or portable for that matter. But in speaking about home standby, you know the installation is still a large overall part of the total cost of ownership. And so from our standpoint there are both technical solutions available to us and we’ve been working on for a number of years to try and reduce the cost in installation, but also market forces. You know we have five thousand dealers out there and we have been collecting speaking of data and enormous amount of data from power play. Remember power play gives us visibility to the entire proposal that a dealer is putting out there for the consumer. So I now not only have the generator component of that, but I have the installation component of that, and then some cases that are very detailed level. So it’s given us some great data and insight into just where is the installation cost coming from and how does it vary region to region and dealer to dealer. And we see some really good opportunities for best practices to be shared amongst dealers in terms of reducing install costs and being more efficient during the installation itself. And there’s I think some market forces that that I think we can use to our advantage to try and drive a lower install cost for homeowners going forward. So, those two things in particular Mike, you know again we’re excited about the opportunity in these things and we haven’t really, we've been focused on more on the fringe, but not maybe in the bulls eye here and that’s really where we’re going to focus on going forward.
Michael Halloran – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thanks for the time.
Aaron Jagdfeld:  Thanks Mike.
York Ragen:  Thanks Mike.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey D. Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Hey, good morning guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld:  Good morning Jeff.
York Ragen:  Good morning Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Again just, you talked about you know I know most of the focus has been on kind of that the storm and residential. But you talked about oil & gas as an opportunity. Can you just size how big you think the oil & gas market is for you guys kind of given the couple acquisitions? And what’s kind of the timeframe where you think you’ll have a more formidable kind of approach or proactive approach to kind of addressing that big opportunity?
Aaron Jagdfeld:  Yeah, it’s a great question Jeff the one that we’ve been intensely focused on here. As we said on the last call, we kicked off a pretty aggressive project internally here to do exactly that, to quantify the opportunity, to understand the service model we need, to be successful there, the products you know where there are gaps or product opportunities. That’s ongoing, I mean we’re coming to the tail end of it here, as we get our plans formulated for 2015 and it’s our intention when we get to kind of 2015 guidance that we’ll give on the next call to kind of I think frame that out more discreetly for investors and yeah, we'll have a much better idea ourselves what’s going to be needed to be successful there in terms of the investment level that matches that opportunity level. We think the opportunity level is pretty big. We're just you know getting out arms around exactly how big and where can we play, where can we be successful. I mean you have the backdrop too. Oil prices coming down, so you know trying to quantify some of the impact on that in the short term, longer term we just, you know we think it’s a multi decade run here domestic oil energy production. But in the short term there may be some variability with that that we’ve trying to get our arms around to understand. You know as a vertical for us in particular now when you pro forma in the MAC acquisition, the heater acquisition that we did, it's become an incredibly important vertical for us on our C&I side. It’s rivaling the telecom market for us in terms of the size, just raw size and frankly you know we like to grow trajectory of it. It’s grown well this year as we’ve talked and we think there’s a tremendous amount of upside and we see the opportunity to kind of carve out a niche there in the engine powered equipment space in that market that could be very beneficial to the company longer term and so, more to come on that Jeff. I appreciate the question. I think we’re just we’re probably just you know a little bit premature in getting too detailed about our kind of spelling out the opportunity, but it will come.
Jeffrey D. Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, great and then just some fine tuning questions. Can you give us the acquisition revenue in the quarter?
York Ragen: Yes, so the Powermate acquisition was very small and you recall them September 1, so on the resi side, those are first really acquisition that you think about in the resi side, but it was very small. When you look at C&I, so as reported C&I was down about 3%. Organically, with the telecom reduction, organically C&I was actually down 15% or mid teens, so it's roughly 12% contribution for acquisitions on just the C&I category.
Jeffrey D. Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then can you size the annual revenue run rate or trailing on both the MAC and Powermate businesses?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, Jeff, I'll start with -- that is an example of it and really was a portable generator and manufacturer and we see this cycle repeat. Unfortunately, that's a company I went through two of these before because it's focused only on portable gens. When you get into extended periods of low outages, part of the gen company just can't. They have a really difficult surviving if that's their business model. And so we basically that was really about buying the brands and some inventory working capital and it's small on a run rate basis because of just -- because of that current backdrop in the environment. I can't expand very quickly though as we've noted that when you get outages, that's the end of the market that expands pretty quickly. The MAC side, just from a competitive standpoint, we're not going to give you kind of the discrete revenue numbers. We disclosed that it's about 100 employees, it's really a niche focused company on really exposed very heavily to oil and gas and something that we think is the opportunity to put that into our kind of general rental customers on a more aggressive basis through the Magnum sales force or mobile product sales force. We really like the upside opportunity to do that in terms of revenue synergies, but that's something we're not giving to give the discreet numbers on that.
York Ragen: Unlike the margins on that business.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes exactly and the margins are greater in that business as well.
Jeffrey D. Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just real quickly back to telecom, I know you don't always give great visibility, but just qualitatively as you talk to those major customers, does this kind of dip tied to some other spending or are they giving you kind of any color on how they're thinking about the product category and the spend category kind of long term and what their penetration rates are etcetera.
Aaron Jagdfeld: I wish I could tell you that we sit down and have deep meaningful conversations about that with them, but unfortunately I think that they approach it kind of from a project basis year-to-year and they make decisions puts and takes in their CapEx spending on when to kind of put this project ahead of others and when to put to this project behind others. And the dialogue right now has been strictly around -- and we're really talking again kind of about one customer here that had a project ongoing to 1harden their network more aggressively. They backed off of that project, whether it's tied to their decision and the announcement to make a big acquisition which -- they made an announcement as such earlier this year. We don't know. They don't give us that kind of detail, but again it's our belief and we've seen this movie kind -- I've watched this movie before and been through this cycle before and they back off, but then ultimately they come back to it because they understand the importance of hardening the network. And again I would -- may be I feel differently about this opportunity long term if we were at 75% or 80% penetration of cell sites, but being at 30% to 35% penetration and knowing that just kind of everything that's going through wireless today from data to critical communications, I mean that's only -- that's only advancing further. It's not relaxing. And so as the leader in that industry, we think that there is great opportunity long term, great runway in that. It's just unfortunate the visibility we get is low and it can be a bit from quarter to quarter and year to year it can be a bit, we hate this word, volatile, but in that particular segment, there can be some puts and takes that unfortunately we just don't get the kind of visibility we would like. It's a challenge to run a business that way. I would tell you that much. And I think one of the reasons these guys really like is, is we are incredibly flexible and we serve -- our served model for them is one of flexibility. Some of the inventory we've got that was asked about earlier. There is some inventory in telecom because we don't know when they turn it back on and want to go after a project or spend some budget. And so we keep ourselves kind of in the game that way and make sure that we're being responsive to their plans and their project plans.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of [Brian] (ph) from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Brian.
Unidentified Analyst: First question just Latin America, what percentage of your revenue did that account for in the quarter roughly?
York Ragen: We don't give that out discretely. It is relatively small on a relative basis.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, okay.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Percentage wise, Brian, if we broke it out; we would be given the revs. I think we said [indiscernible] revs before. I don't have the number in front of me. So I don't mean recording of the percentage is something I guess mathematically could be done, but we haven’t -- we haven’t done it that way, you can probably do the math though. But that business, that's a great business. 60-year history it's just, it's had a really difficult end market. They depend on big projects. There is a baseline business within that business of everyday kind of gen sets and then there is kind of the bigger projects and the bigger projects are an important element of that business. And unfortunately the bigger projects with the tepid kind of economic environment down in Latin America both in Mexico, but also in some other countries that frankly were important kind of element of what was going on in [indiscernible] Venezuela is one call out. That's an important market that has a lot of need for backup power on a big project basis without their dependence on hydro and the way that that can wax and wane from year-to-year. But with the dislocation going on economically in Venezuela and in other parts of Latin America, those big projects have really cooled off and that unfortunately hurt the business. I would say the other side of the equation with auto has been the transition away from one of the major engine suppliers there and to a new supply chain has been a bit more difficult than they probably estimate and probably then we estimated. We're through it now and I think we feel like we're at a point where it's good things ahead. We're seeing improvement second half over first half in our auto business in 2014 here. So we think that that's something that -- and as those big projects return as the economy improves with some of the things that we're hearing in Mexico and in other parts of Latin America, we're I guess -- we remain I guess, we're taking a little bit of a wait and see approach, but at the same time, we like the fact that it gives us a great base to operate from in Latin America and we're continuing to invest there, because we believe that that's going to be a great market over the next decade. It's just -- it's going to -- it's taking a little bit longer time to get around that process then maybe we thought.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Really appreciate the detailed answer there. And then in the past I think you’ve quantified for us in some way where we are in terms of outage activity. You mentioned you enormous data base there and you’ve got the baseline historically, but clearly we're at a low level, but can you quantify how low we are relative to history?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, so in the quarter, I think we said last time 65% below when we were talking about Q2 and the baseline we we're referencing was through the end of 2010, excuse me, 2010 to 2012 without major outages. So the baseline from 2010 to 2012 without major outages, that was the baseline. Q2 outage level was 65% below that level. When you compare -- if you look at Q3 and you use that same 2010 to 2012, it's about mid 50%, 56% something like that below. That Q3 was about 56% below that. We think that kind of taking a conservative view on that, you’ve to kind of build the baseline. You’ve to add in the other quarters that have happened since 2012 without major outages, which are basically all of 2013 and what's going on here in 2014 and we would be -- so if you kind of recalibrate that baseline to include the more recent activity, the third quarters outage activity will be about 40% below that recalibrate baseline. So the baseline continues to grow every quarter you add to it and as we do that going forward, we'll try and get that information out there, but we would be about 40% below that in the third quarter. So it was well below. I mean it was really hard to see. If you will look at the month progression, I mean September was just like awfully below. It was terrible.
Operator: Thank you. And the last question is from the line Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel Nicolaus: Great guys. Thank you very much. Quick question on the SG&A spend, you kind of reworking the C&I distribution and then you talked about some addition sales training on the residential side and then you will see what happens with the go-to-market on the oil and gas side. But should we think of that business ex amortization on a go-forward basis as kind of running at higher levels than what you have had historically.
York Ragen: On a raw dollars basis are you talking Stanley?
Stanley Elliott - Stifel Nicolaus: Yes. Or percentage sales, however you want to frame it.
York Ragen: Part of your answer is looking on the 2015 and I guess we'll round those numbers up as we speak, so I would be speaking prematurely to talk about '15, but I think we have talked about over time as we've grown. We do invest in the SG&A infrastructure of our business to support not only the baseline, the new and higher baseline, but also to drive the future growth of the business. So you tend not to -- you have step functions of that SG&A as a whole, I guess…
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think I would this Stanley, again and I hate to keep coming back to history as a guide post because I know it's no guarantee of the future, but having been around the business as long as we have and our experience levels, one thing that and I think it's a classic mistake of others perhaps either in this industry and other industries when they experience kind of end market kind of cycles that are may be below like long term averages like we're experiencing with outages and our example. Continuing to invest in infrastructure is a really critical part about being able to take advantage fully of the next up-cycle. If you don't do that, you will find yourself unable to really capitalize on the next leg up in growth. We've said this before and unfortunately as a public company -- we've only been a public company for four years, so the public markets maybe haven’t seen the step function that occurs in this business from time to time, but as we look at it and look at it over history, those step functions do occur and those legs up can be aggressive and the flat part of the step or the trade part of the step if you will, that is the part that we feel that at least here in the back half of this year, we're certainly in. And we got -- I think you're seeing in the SG&A that level of spending that we're at today reflects our belief that the infrastructure investments are necessary to make sure that we fully capitalize on the next leg up. As you -- we'll give better guidance on that as we go into '15 in terms of where our thoughts and views are on that as we go forward, but at least as it relates to the back half of this year, I think what you're seeing reflected in the face of the P&L and in our guidance for Q4, definitely speaks for the fact that we're going to continue to invest in whether it be sales training or whether it's R&D for products or the infrastructure of the company, that's where -- we think that that's really important to continue to do.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel Nicolaus: Great guys. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Great. We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning and we look forward to our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings release, which we anticipate we will be talking to you in mid February of next year. So with that, well thank you and have a good morning.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a very good day.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-07-31 09:00:00) =====
Executives:  Aaron Jagdfeld – President and Chief Executive Officer York A. Ragen – Chief Financial Officer 
Analysts:  Matthew Rybak – Goldman, Sachs & Co. Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America Merrill Lynch James Sturgill – KeyBanc Capital Markets Michael Halloran – Robert W. Baird & Co. John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity Tim Mulrooney – William Blair & Co.
Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2014 Generac Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tahisha, and I’ll be operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.
York A. Ragen: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today’s call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I’ll now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter results reflect seasonally higher shipments as compared to the first quarter of 2014, driven by the expected sequential increase in residential products. In addition, our results further demonstrate the ongoing diversification of our business as shipments of Commercial & Industrial products continue to represent a growing portion of our sales as we’ve increased our exposure to new markets such as oil & gas, broadened our industrial product line, and strengthened our industrial distribution network. Second quarter net sales increased 5% to $363 million, as compared to $347 million in the second quarter of 2013. C&I product sales increased 23% during the second quarter, due to a combination of recent acquisitions and strength in the oil & gas market. As expected, residential products faced a strong prior year comparison as sales were $180 million compared to $197 million in the prior year quarter, which benefited from elevated demand due to Superstorm Sandy. Excluding this prior year benefit, residential product sales increased at a solid rate over the prior year, primarily as a result of strong shipments of home standby generators. The strong year-over-year in home standby generators was achieved in spite of the backdrop of a power outage environment that has been trending well below normalized baseline levels in recent quarters. As we have previously mentioned, we monitor power outage activity internally and over the last six quarters outage severity has declined considerably as compared to a previous normalized period, which excludes the impacts of major outage events. We believe the growth experienced in home standby generators during the second quarter despite this lower power outage environment supports our position in permanently installed standby generators on an emerging product category as a backup power solution for homes with an installed base that continues to grow. In addition, we believe our sales growth during the second quarter points against invaluable market share in the category as we continue to benefit from our broad distribution, innovative sales and marketing processes and new product introductions. We expect that the long-term trend of an increasing level of power outages driven by an aging and underinvested electrical grid and coupled with the proliferation of digital electronics, favorable demographics and increasingly severe weather will continue well into the future. We continue to remain particularly focused on additional opportunities to increase the awareness of home standby generators using our unique sales and marketing tools, including our A.M.P. targeted marketing process and our direct response television campaign along with our digital and traditional advertising efforts. The sales leads generated from these sources are directed to our Generac lead team for qualification and scheduling of an in-home consultation through our PowerPlay in-home selling solution. Many of these sales and marketing tools only became fully operational within the past year and a half and formed an innovative and cost effective approach to identifying and qualifying sales leads. During the second quarter and entering into the second half of 2014, we’re increasing our media spend for the Power You Control infomercial campaign, which has been contributing to a notable increase in-home consultation in recent months. Also, during the second half, we will have an increased focus on improving sales closure rates from home standby generators by further optimizing the use of these tools, including new and improved training programs for our dealers, leveraging the recent availability of new financing options within PowerPlay and further enhancements to the PowerPlay application itself. With only approximately 3% of U.S. households owning a stationary backup generator, there is a substantial opportunity to grow the residential standby category on the long-term. We also wanted to discuss an exciting new addition to our home standby product line this morning. Our new 22 kilowatt Guardian Series air-cooled standby generator launched on July 1, provides the highest output in an air-cooled generator currently available in the marketplace. This new power note dramatically improves the affordability for those homeowners requiring a larger generator for carrying higher amperage power loads. Previously these homeowners would have had to step up to a liquid-cooled product solution, which cost thousands of dollars more. We’re excited about this product as we believe it gives us a further advantage over our competitors as this new unit expands on the breadth of our industry-leading product line. Also contributing to the year-over-year sales growth in residential products in the second quarter was an increase in revenue from power washers. With the successful roll out of several new products as well as the increased placement of our consumer and prosumer units at certain retail channel partners we believe we continue to make good progress in growing our market share in the power washer product category. Sales of our Commercial & Industrial products during the current quarter increased at a strong rate, driven primarily by the Tower Light and Baldor generator acquisitions as well as strong shipments of gaseous generators for oil & gas applications, partially offset by a decline in sales within certain Latin American markets. We continue to see some notable strength in the quarter from rental equipment customers in the U.S. as a result of strong demand in the oil & gas market. As we’ve been discussing recently, we are particularly excited about the increased exposure of this particular vertical market that the combined Baldor and Magnum acquisition give us. Through these two acquisitions we now have a broad product line of mobile and stationary gaseous fueled generators that are capable of running on well gas generated at the drilling site. Advances in drilling technologies over the past several years has created access to a significant supply of shale gas, which has created an attractive secular opportunity for both mobile and stationary power equipment demand, including the need for support equipment, such as light towers, generators and pumps that are essential at these drilling sites. The oil & gas market is expected to be an important end market vertical for Generac going forward and we are further evaluating the opportunity to better determine the appropriate levels of investment and resources needed as we position ourselves to participate in this potential long-term up cycle. With regards to Baldor generators, the integration of this recent acquisition and the build out of our industrial distribution network, both remain key corporate focal points during the second half of 2014. As a reminder, Baldor offers a broad line of higher power outputs, standby and prime rated products throughout the U.S. and Canada. The addition of these products significantly expands our industrial product offering and manufacturing footprint and essentially doubles the addressable domestic market that we and our distribution partners can serve. We continue to make good progress in strengthening our distribution as we work to combine the Generac and Baldor industrial networks and we are particularly focused on increasing our sales bandwidth to better enable our distribution partners to sell the larger generators and systems now available to them. This includes a greater level of interfacing with the engineering firms responsible for specifying these products in an effort to improve their knowledge of our recently expanded product offering. In addition to our sales efforts, we’ve identified some meaningful product cost synergies given our increased manufacturing and sourcing scale as we transition the acquired product and facility into the Generac portfolio. Our Tower Light acquisition that closed in August 2013 continues to perform well. Headquartered outside Milan, Italy this acquisition positions Generac as a global leader in the light tower product category and allows us to participate in the growing rental market outside the U.S. Their broad global distribution and innovative products that are tailored to serve local markets are key contributors to an established history of profitable growth. We continue to evaluate additional revenue and cost synergy opportunities as we further integrate Tower Light into the company. Our Ottomotores business based in Mexico experienced a decline in sales within Latin America during the second quarter of 2014. This decline was primarily driven by a combination of a difficult prior-year comparison related to certain large projects that shipped in the second quarter of 2013, which did not repeat, as well as overall softness in Latin American markets, which has been negatively impacting infrastructure spending in the region. Although the market has been recently challenging, we have continued to make good progress on our integration efforts with Ottomotores and this acquisition remains an essential platform for our international expansion efforts by providing a local manufacturing presence and access to the important Latin American market for power generation and other engine powered equipment. We continue to be focused on executing our Powering Ahead strategic plan, which includes growing the overall residential standby generator market, gaining industrial market share, diversifying our end markets and expanding internationally.  This strategic plan serves as a foundation for the investments we make to drive the penetration of our products, create a new and higher baseline of demand and resulting in a more diversified company with improved global scale. Combining this strategy with the long-term growth drivers for our business and the potential for future recovery in key microeconomic indicators, we believe Generac is well-positioned over the long-term to drive future growth and shareholder value. I’d now like to turn the call back over to York to discuss second quarter results in more detail. York?
York A. Ragen:  Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the second quarter of 2014 increased 4.6% to $362.6 million as compared to $346.7 million in the second quarter of 2013. With the prior year benefiting from elevated demand from Superstorm Sandy. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales were $179.6 million in the second quarter of 2014, as compared to $164 million in the first quarter of 2014, a 9.5% sequential increase over the last quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, residential product sales declined from the $196.6 million that was shipped in the second quarter of 2013. Shipments of residential products during the prior year, second quarter of 2013 were positively impacted by approximately $40 million as we continue to ramp production levels, to satisfy the extended lead times that existed during the quarter. By contrast, lead times during 2014 have been at more normalized levels. Excluding this $40 million of benefit during the prior year quarter, residential product sales increased approximately 15% year-over-year driven mainly by strong shipments of home standby generators. Demand for these products benefited from both normal pre-season patterns as well as numerous initiatives to drive a new and higher baseline for the category. In addition to home standby generators, we also saw significant year-over-year percentage increase in sales of our power washer products as we continue to gain market share and brand recognition in this product category. Partially offsetting the strength was the year-over-year decline in sales of portable generators due to a combination of lower power outage severity over recent quarters, coupled with the prior year second quarter still benefiting from elevated demand and replenishment following Superstorm Sandy. Looking at our Commercial & Industrial products, net sales increased 22.5% to $163.5 million in the second quarter of 2014, as compared to $133.4 million in the second quarter of 2013. The increase in C&I net sales was driven primarily by the acquisitions of Tower Light, which closed in August 2013 and Baldor Generators, which closed in November 2013. Additionally, we are seeing positive momentum in the oil and gas markets as demand for certain stationary and mobile products has increased significantly through our rental customer base. Also, contributing to year-over-year sales growth in C&I products were increased sales of natural gas generators using light commercial and retail applications. Partially offsetting these increases was the decline of sales within certain Latin American markets as Aaron previously discussed. Our other product sales category improved to $19.6 million in the second quarter of 2014, an increase of 17.5% from the prior year second quarter sales of $16.6 million. This growth is due to an increase in sales of service parts as the installed base of our products continues to grow with the overall growth of the company and to a lesser extent the contribution from recent acquisitions. Gross margin for the second quarter was 35.3% compared to 37.8% in the prior year second quarter. This 250 basis point decline in gross margin was due to a combination of the Baldor Generators acquisition, along with the return to regular promotional activities consistent with a period of normal seasonality. Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2014 declined $4.7 million or 8.6% as compared to the second quarter of 2013. Included in operating expense for the current year quarter is a $4.9 million gain, relating to re-measurement of the contingent earn out obligation from a recent acquisition. Excluding this gain, operating expenses for the second quarter of 2014 were flat, as compared to the previous year, despite the addition of operating expenses from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins came in slightly ahead of our expectation at 23.3% of net sales in the second quarter of 2014, as compared to 26% of net sales in the same period last year. Compared to prior year, adjusted EBITDA margins were primarily impacted by the overall decline in gross profit margin, as previously discussed. Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months as of June 30, 2014 was $365.7 million or 25.3% of net sales. GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2014 was $54 million, as compared to $28.3 million for the second quarter of 2013. Included in other income expense in the current year quarter was a $16 million non-cash gain, associated with the 25 basis point reduction in our term loan interest rate, resulting from our credit agreement leverage ratios stepping below three times at the beginning of the second quarter. As a result of our elected GAAP accounting method related to the amortization of the deferred financing costs and original issue discount on debt, the entire $16 million future benefit from the 25 basis point interest rate reduction over the remaining term of the loan is required to be fully recognized as a gain in the current quarter. Similarly, included in other income expense in the prior year second quarter was $13.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt, as a result of our May 2013 credit agreement refinancing and other debt prepayments that were made during the prior year quarter. Updating our interest expense guidance, our cash debt service costs are now projected to be between $41 million to $42 million for the full year 2014, while amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount are now expected to be approximately $7 million, during 2014. For a full year 2014 GAAP interest expense total of $48 million to $49 million. Adjusted net income as defined in our earnings release was $57.1 million in the current year quarter versus $66.6 million in the prior year second quarter. This decline over the prior year is the result of the previously discussed lower gross margins, along with a $9 million increase in cash income tax expense over the prior year quarter. These reductions were partly outset by $2.8 million in lower interest expense due to a reduction in interest rate from the May 2013 refinancing over senior secured term loans. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.70 in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2013. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconciled in our earnings release was $0.82 for the current year quarter compared to $0.95 per share in the prior year quarter. With regard to cash income taxes, the second quarter of 2014 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $11.7 million as compared to $2.7 million in the prior year quarter. As we’ve commented during recent earnings calls, our cash income taxes for 2014 are expected to increase over the prior year due to a combination of our NOL carryforwards and certain tax credit carryforwards becoming full utilized during 2013. As well as certain discrete tax deductions that were taken in 2013 that will not repeat in 2014. Our cash income tax rate for the full year 2014 is now anticipated to be 17% to 18% versus our previous expectations of 19% to 20% due to our higher level of benefit than previously expected from certain tax credits. As a reminder even though we are now starting to pay income taxes, our favorable tax shield through annual intangible asset amortization and our tax return remains intact through 2021, resulting in approximately $49 million of cash tax savings per year for the next eight years. As a result our cash income tax rate is expected to be significantly lower than our currently projected 34% to 36% GAAP income tax rate in 2014. As we drive higher profitability over time cash income taxes can be estimated by applying a projected longer term GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% on pre-tax profits going forward, and then deducting approximately $49 million of annual cash tax savings from the tax shield each year through 2021. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $40.5 million in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to $30.3 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year decline in operating earnings during the current year quarter was more than offset by less investment in working capital compared to the prior year second quarter. The prior year included a significant use of cash to replenish finished good inventory levels that have been depleted from Superstorm Sandy. Free cash flow over the 12 months was $236.9 million. As we mentioned during our last earnings call, we made a voluntary prepayement of debt totaling $12 million in April 2014 that will be applied against our excess cash flow payment requirement in our credit facility, as well as against future term loan principal amortization for the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2014, we had a total $1.16 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount, and $198 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $963.3 million. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.6 times, a level that is within our targeted range of 2 times to 3 times. With that I would now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide additional comments on our outlook for 2014.
Aaron Jagdfeld:  Thanks York. We are reaffirming our prior guidance this morning for 2014 in terms of revenue growth, EBITDA margins and free cash flow. For the full year 2014, net sales are still expected to increase in the mid-single digit range as compared to the prior year. This sales outlook assumes an increased level of power outage severity in the second half of 2014 as compared to recent quarters, returning to a more normalized annual baseline level. Additionally, as we have previously discussed the timing of CapEx spending for certain telecom and other national account customers can vary from quarter to quarter which may have an impact on our previously guided seasonality. Our current sales outlook does not assume a material deferral in CapEx spending with these customers and contemplates a sequential sales increase from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. In summarizing our sales growth assumptions for 2014 excluding the impact of the $140 million headwind related to the first half 2013 production ramp in residential products to normalize lead times, we still expect total organic year-over-year growth to be between 9% and 11%. When including the prior year headwind we still expect organic growth to be approximately flat year-over-year in 2014. The acquisitions of Tower Light and Baldor Generators are still expected to contribute approximately 5% growth resulting in an overall year-over-year next sales increase in the mid single-digit range. With regards to gross margins we’re expecting sequential improvement in the second half of 2014 of approximately 150 basis points, as a result of a higher mix of residential product sales, and price cost improvements expected in the second half of the year. We are also reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for 2014, as we continue to see adjusted EBITDA margins remaining in the mid 20% range, which is consistent with the average level of experience during the past four years. Adjusted EBITDA margins during the fourth quarter are expected to increase approximately 150 basis points as compared to the third quarter. Furthermore, we expect we will continue to generate significant free cash flow in 2014, given our superior margin profile, capital efficient operating model, low cost of debt and favorable tax attributes. For full year 2014, we still expect our conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow to be approximately 90%. In closing this morning as we continue to execute on our Powering Ahead strategic plan and capitalize on a long term secular growth drivers for our business we believe, we will continue to generate strong free cash flow for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are confident in our ability to continue to investment in the future growth of the business, both organically and through M&A, while also evaluating priority uses of cash to enhance shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks and at this time we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs, please proceed.
Matthew Rybak – Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Good Morning, York and Aaron, it’s Matt on behalf of Jerry.
Aaron Jagdfeld:  Hi Matt.
York A. Ragen:  Hi Matt.
Matthew Rybak – Goldman, Sachs & Co.: I want to start on the residential standby side and may be, Aaron on you could talk a little bit about the order levels and improve trends that you’re seeing as we start-off the third quarter and how those are tracking versus expectations?
Aaron Jagdfeld:  Yes, I think, in our comments are – I will talk about it in a couple of ways, Matt, I mean the thing that we watch some indicators as we look at this residential business, it used to be we didn’t have a tremendous amount of visibility to it. It was the tough business to kind of predict and I’m talking about the standby business now, of course, and in terms of, future kind of thoughts around that it was really kind of related just to what’s going on with the order book, currently today because lead times are pretty short on those products. What’s really Interesting is over the last year and a half as we have introduced some of these new tools that we got, and we are driving leads into our call centers here, we not only, obviously track lead volume, but we track the – what we call in-home consultations right, it sees that we create on a go-forward basis, coming out of those inbound calls. And so, what we have seen both, kind of closing out the second quarter and as we start the third quarter here, as we have seen a nice improvement in the IHC (ph) rate, and again this is on the backdrop in our comments, our prepared remarks this morning, overall outage events have been pretty quiet in the last six quarters since Sandy, and in fact, pretty down compared to the historical kind of longer term averages than we look at – if you look back to last couple of years. Even when you exclude, any kind of major events like Sandy or Irene or anything like that, the outage activity has been pretty weak. And that’s – we saw those cycles from time to time, we are in one of those cycles now. Our guidance contemplates version in the mean basically in – from an annual baseline level of outage activity that we believe needs to happen here in 2014 in order for us to realize, our guidance on the residential side. That being said we are coming into our season now third quarter is where we would see that so, we’ve seen a nice pick upcoming out of the second quarter. You see that in our second quarter results of home standby as we get the channel, ready for the season. That is the cadence for this business, when you get a year kind of following year without storms. So everything is kind of falling in line the way we see it. And we like where we see some of these leading indicators IHC.
Matthew Rybak – Goldman, Sachs & Co.: That is very helpful, and then if I could just switch gears briefly and turn to the commercial business. If you may be quantify the headwind in Latin America that you’re seeing and maybe talk a little bit more about how you expect that business to progress for you over the rest of the year?
York A. Ragen: Yes, I am not going to quantify it directly though, but I will talk about that business, because I think it’s an important discussion point. Ottomotores was a – we talked about Ottomotores a lot, as a company and we talked about it to our investors – great business. It’s a great business down in Mexico City, they are located down there. A couple of plants in Mexico City, and distribution kind of throughout Mexico. They sell a lot of the product on a direct basis, within the Mexican City area. Obviously, Mexico City is almost a little bit of a different entity unto itself from Mexico. In terms of its dependence on what kind of goes on in the government there in Mexico that kind of – has in terms of ebbs and flows of spending, in particular CapEx spending as it relates to infrastructure. There was a – it’s been a fairly notable pull back with the change in administration there that happened a year ago. I think, due to a couple of things, one I think everybody was kind of expecting CapEx spending probably to pick up not pull back. But what happened is the administration is – I think doing the right things for the long-term. But unfortunately it’s impacting things negatively in a short-term. For the longer term, they are trying to open up the energy markets there to private investment. And in doing so, obviously that’s been bit of a slog for them, politically. But they have gotten to a point now, where there is a kind of a quasi public/private approach to that. And I think that is going to be good long-term for the energy sector in Mexico, good for the economy in Mexico. Good for people who are investing in Mexico like Generac. And we kind of view this as kind of an investment in our future in Latin America, because this thing can open up a lot of opportunity. But in the meantime it took a while to write all the rules, and to get things through the political environment there. And so those rules have only recently come out around the – that kind of quasi public/private investment structure. So, we think that going forward here in Mexico the economic environment, it’s our belief will improve off of what has been a fairly dismal performance. I think all the economic forecast for Mexico have started out – beginning of the year, last two years, have started up very robust and have moved down. I believe it was just north of 1% GDP, last year for Mexico. So, that business just to frame the backdrop for you, Matt has been challenging just from a macro-environment standpoint. And then obviously the rest of Latin America has been somewhat challenged. We had a fair amount of exposure through Ottomotores to the Venezuelan market, and obviously Venezuela has been very challenging with the change in guard there. And so there’s some things there in terms of big projects that go on in Venezuela that haven’t happened over the course of the last year and a half. We do have a business in Brazil that came with the Ottomotores acquisition in Curitiba. That business has done quite well. Now it’s off of a fairly small base. It’s kind of a greenfield startup about four years ago, but it’s performed well in spite of Brazilian economy that hasn’t. So, we like what we see down there. It’s a great springboard for us as kind of the first acquisition outside the U.S. to get our feet wet with. Now, the other thing I’ll give you as a backdrop. This is a business that we bought, was owned by basically an industrial holding company and it was somewhat ignored, unfortunately underinvested in. So we had some investment catch up. We’ve been doing that. The integration efforts have been ongoing over the last year, year and a half. We’re pleased with the results. On the integration side, we just like to see the market pick up so that we can realize some additional commercial success there. But by and large this is going to be a home run for us in the long run and we’re still very excited and very bullish on it.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning. Thanks guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Ross.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. Aaron, I just was wondering if you can flush out your outlook statement a little bit more and maybe give a little more color on what specifically need to happen in the second half of the year with respect to power outage activity to deliver your full year outlook. So, in your outlook segment are you saying that the level of power outage activity in the first half was subnormal and therefore you need a greater than normal level of outages to return to a more normalized baseline for the full year. Or are you just saying that you need normal seasonal power outage activity to pick up in Q3 and you’ll be fine?
Aaron Jagdfeld: It’s the former, not the latter. So what we saw is the first half of year outages were down considerably, down 65% in fact to kind of the average prior to Sandy. And that’s something that we track internally. We watch outages and we watch duration of outages, frequency of outages, number of people impacted and outage activity has been soft. And as generator manufacturer as our primary product category, I made reference to before, I mean that outage is ebb and flow. The reversion of the main comment that I made is exactly what we need to have happened, which means in your words, an elevated level in the second half over the lower level that we had in the first half to return to that kind of normal annual kind of cadence that we would see in outages for the baseline level and that excludes major events. Now, that return to the main can happen and a major event could happen in a series of smaller events. We have seen a much reduced volume here. It’s just been pretty quiet in the last several quarters.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  And if you just see this sort of continued law on power outage activity despite the normal seasonality, can you give us a sense as to what your full year outlook would look like?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, I mean, we’re going to stick to our guidance because we believe in the reversion. Everything reverts to mean over time. And, again, because of our history and we’ve seen this before, an outage can happen tomorrow, an outage could happen today, could happen 10 minutes from now, could happen four quarters from now. There’s no exact science to it. All that we can say is that we continue to look at the long-term macro thesis of the business in terms of the quality of power that is i.e. major power outages or power outages affecting large amounts of people continue to increase and that has been on the rise for more than a decade. And, again, we believe that that’s tied to all the things that we always talk about, Ross, in terms of underinvestment in the grid, the age, the components of the grid, our dependence on electricity as a society, the aging in place concept that we talk about a lot in terms of people willing to stay in their homes as long as possible, automatic power generation, backup power generation gives people independence to do that. All those trends are in place. Those haven’t materially changed. It’s just some of this quarter-to-quarters stuff in terms of what outages can do over the long haul. And so, again, our view is that we’re going to have a reversion of the mean in the second half.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. With respect to residential and the 15% gain ex- the $40 million in the base year, is it possible to say how much power washers contributed to that because you’d mentioned that you had a higher than historical mix there? And if you excluded power washers, would your standby generator business been up or less than that 15%?
Aaron Jagdfeld: The overwhelming majority, Ross, is home standby generators. I mean power washers, it’s an important category for us, a growing category, but we’re still a pretty small player in that. So, the overwhelming majority was home standby generators. 
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And how about your dealer count? What does your dealer count look like in the second quarter? And are you still confident that you can get 300 to 500 net adds this year? And are you seeing any abnormal levels of attrition? Or you have incentivized new dealers with stronger promotions to get them to come on board?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good question. Our dealer count was roughly flat with the first quarter. So we think that we’ve kind of hit the bottom of kind of losses on the dealer count side, kind of worked around the corner there, if you will, in terms of what the cycle goes like with dealer adds and losses over the course of post outage of that like we experienced here. So we like the fact that we’ve kind of flattened out a bit there. As far as guidance for the rest of the year, as we’ve said on previous calls, we’re going to be at the low end of that 300 to 400 that we normally add on a net basis. So that’s we’re still folding in there on that guidance. We think that the second half of the year, again, in particular with our comments about reversion to the mean and outage events, obviously, you tend to get more inbound traffic and outbound traffic on dealer acquisition as we refer to it, new dealer adds when you have an environment that has more power outages. So we would anticipate if all of that kind of holds together that we would still achieve the low end of that range at the very least. As far as what we had to do to bring on new dealers, we’ve got a pretty consistent pipeline that we work on that. Now obviously when you don’t have as many outages you backdrop, you work harder to bring those dealers into the fold, but we still have a tremendous amount of interest in the category. It’s not real hard to sell people on the idea of adding this to an electrical contractor, an HVAC contractors business.  It starts out being kind of an ancillary part of their business and for those that really get it over time when you look at kind of – you look at that dealer progression kind of on a vintage analysis basis over time. There is a percentage of those dealers that go on to really shed their contracting businesses and become generator dealers all by themselves and that’s a progression that we continue to look for. We always are out there. Our Honeywell program is all about adding new distribution in the HVAC space. And that’s been a nice place for us to focus on here in not only the back half of last year, but in the front half of this year. We are getting into kind of the cooling season right now. If you lose a little bit of their focus and attention as they focus on air conditioning, but those areas, we believe there’s still a tremendous opportunity with 70,000 electrical contractors in the U.S. and 100,000 HVAC contractors out there. There’s a tremendous pool from which to pull from for new distribution.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And then just my last one, just on telecom. Are you actually seeing any – do you have any reasons to be concerned about order delays right now? Are you seeing anything in your business today or you just got highlighting that in the past when there’s been consolidation activity that you can see some shifting around? And I think you were saying that telecom deliveries would be more weighted to Q4 than Q3, but I’m not sure if I heard that correctly.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You did hear that correctly, Ross. So in terms of – telecom business is, as much as I say, we’ve been fortunate enough to improve our visibility as it relates to residential. Our visibility on the telecom side is really challenging for us as a business, and that’s why we call it out as a risk. Basically on every call we say that that business in particular can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. Our expanded comments there this morning are really related to the fact that – we’ve witnessed in the past, when some of the major customers we have there, do acquisitions or announce other major deals, has been announced by one of these customers recently that can create a deferral in CapEx spending. We have not been notified directly of any such deferrals, but at the same time there’s always a caution around these guys in terms of what they can do with that CapEx and take that CapEx budget. Recently one of those customers came out and did reaffirm their CapEx guidance for the balance of the year. For us we’ve kind of read that as somewhat a positive sign. It wasn’t a reduction in the CapEx spend that they were forecasting, but we’ll see how it translates into spent on generators, right. Unfortunately, that level of detail is not given to us and not given to the public market. So there’s a fair amount of uncertainty just in timing. It’s a great market, long-term, 300,000 sale sites. Only about 30% of those sites having backup power today and we think that that is, in terms of a long-term secular, opportunity for us just given the amount of critical voice and data that is going through wireless lines today and the conversion to 4G from 3G. There’s a whole host of reasons why these sites should have a generator, why 100% of the sites have generator on them. Whether ultimately it gets legislative or not, it’s not up to us, but what is up to us is to continue to serve those customers with the right product offering and to be able to react quickly when they do want to change course up or down in terms of their CapEx spending.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Got you. Okay, guys. Well, thanks for all the details and best of luck. I’ll jump back in queue
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Ross.
Operator:  Your next question will come from the line of Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
James Sturgill – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Hi, guys. This is James Sturgill filling in for Jeff.
Aaron Jagdfeld:  Hi. How are you doing, James?
York A. Ragen: Hi, James.
James Sturgill – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Can you just provide some more color on the oil & gas space, particularly with respect to natural gas flaring, what you’re seeing there and how close Generac is to having a viable product?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So actually we have products today. We have products to run off well ahead of gas. We are continuing to evaluate what the product mix need to be as these forward. A lot of is kind of on the [fly booked] (ph) for the producers, the E&P producers themselves, the rental companies and ourselves, try and figure out what’s the best way to utilize that flare gas. And flare gas, as you mentioned, James, is one of the leading drivers there in the ship that’s going on, not only at the state level, but also the federal level. There is a lot of discussion right night now on the flare gas. New regulation is being proposed. Some of those regulations take place beginning of next year. And so, there is a lot of discussion between ourselves and our channel partners and our end customers on what kinds of ways can that flare gas be consumed either to produce power or light or pumping. There’s a whole host of applications in particular.  I think what we like is that through the acquisitions we made both at Magnum and at Baldor, it’s really positioned us quite well in terms of a relationship standpoint with the rental companies that serve those customers, both the large national rental companies as well as the specialty power rental companies that serve the oil & gas markets. But those acquisitions have given us a great kind of starting point for a product platform, great relationships as I mentioned, and it’s helped us kind of conceal our thoughts around what we need to do to be successful in this going forward. So, we’ve had a taste of it here over the last couple of quarters, we called that out in terms of success of oil and gas. We look at it as a secular opportunity going forward. We think that the flaring of that Wellhead gas is going to continue to play a role, obviously that’s a bit of a regional thing, it happens – flaring is a bit of more of a something that happens in the Bakken rather than down in the Eagle Ford and some of the shale plays in the south. But we’re learning a lot, we’re quick studies and we think that we are well positioned to capitalize on that.
James Sturgill – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Got it. That’s helpful, thank you. And then just for a clarity in telecom, did I hear correctly that your top line forecast bakes in sequential second half improvement in that space. Or are you speaking to the broader consolidated revenue?
York A. Ragen: Actually it’s sequential improvement from third quarter to fourth quarter is what our reference was, so…
James Sturgill – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, and that’s in line with typical seasonality or do you have something in the backlog that gives you confidence of that?
York A. Ragen: Now, there is not a lot of seasonality with the telecom business, it’s – CapEx spending kind of comes and goes, the ebbs and flows of that are – there is first string somewhere at corporate office and that’s unfortunately as I said before, our visibility is very limited but we do see it shaping up more as a back half of the second half than more of a fourth quarter event than a third quarter event.
James Sturgill – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thanks, I’ll get back in queue.
York A. Ragen:  Right, thank you. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you, James.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Charley Brady from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst:  Hi guys, this is actually Patrick (indiscernible) standing in for Charley.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Patrick.
York A. Ragen: Hi Patrick.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi how is it going? Just on residential side, can you maybe add a little bit more flavor as to how much each of the standby power washers sort of breaks down in terms of revenue?
York A. Ragen: Yes, Patrick, we don’t breakdown the categories of product, I mean that’s a – just from a competitive standpoint, again the preponderance of the increase that we saw in Q2 was mainly driven by the overwhelmingly driven by home standby.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Overall all of our residential products the vast majority is home standby product, that’s the key point.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, perfect. And I think you mentioned that there is standby market still only have 3% penetration, what do you think it sort of the realistic improvement there and is there an overall I guess industry trend of improving the awareness for that category or is Generac doing a lot of the heavy lifting therefore improving that awareness to drive that number up?
Aaron Jagdfeld:  We’re doing all the heavy lifting. Our competitors are so small in the space that we’re driving that market. It’s our bus and we’re in the front seat there. In terms of where it could go ultimately penetration rate, and we’ve made a lot of discussion around this, we’ve had a lot of discussion, but we kind of look at the first fence post in the penetration curve there Patrick is really when you look at portable generator penetration rates which are kind of in the low teens in terms of household penetration, and that’s all households, remember we subset the number of households that we think is our addressable market at about 50 million households for that 3%. So, about 1.5 million households of the 50 million have a permanently installed backup generator today. That’s something that we think at the very least, we think that the first fence post in the penetration curve is those portable generator owners because this an overwhelmingly step up type of category of product in terms of – when we look at that, particularly the buyers of our automatic systems, over half of those buyers either own or owned a portable generator. So, you look at the product lifecycle of a portable generator. The normal replacement cycle there is between 10 and 12 years. So the category for home standby generators is only about 12 to 14 years old. So, the awareness levels still remain kind of in that 30% to 40% range. So, we have a lot of work to do even though we’ve been doing a lot of the heavy lifting. There’s still a lot of opportunity there and a lot of work to be done just to get the awareness levels up to something more respectable on the 70%, 80% range. So, we think that all the things that we’re doing with our in-home selling solution, which we call PowerPlay, an iPad based solution, the infomercial that we do that we’ve been running, we call it Power You Control, are AMP direct marketing process, where we combine third-party household data with our activation data with power outage data. Those are all very unique things and nobody else in our industry is doing because they don’t have the scale to do it, nor do they have the data or I think or the stomach to probably spend the kind of capital that we are spending on it. So one of the things that we mentioned is the free cash flow that we generate in this company has given us a great opportunity to invest in some pretty meaningful things to try and move the needle on awareness and to move the needle on this category more quickly than it would do on its own in the absence of our efforts.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Please proceed.
Michael Halloran – Robert W. Baird & Co.:  Good morning, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld:  Good morning, Mike.
York A. Ragen:  Good morning, Mike.
Michael Halloran – Robert W. Baird & Co.:  So when you think about the rental demand side of things today, what are you seeing from the trajectory there, obviously some types of commentary from some of the public rental guys and some of the contacts. What do are you seeing in your business, what’s the outlook there as well?
York A. Ragen: The rental market for us has been a great market, I mean the Magnum acquisition has performed very, very well over the roughly 2.5 years, almost come up on three years in October of our 10-year of ownership and all of that we believe or lot of that there is kind of couple underlying trends, I mean certainly oil and gas we’d call it out Mike, here more recently but longer term the secular trend of renting versus buying underpins that and you see that, as you said in the rental companies that you guys cover or you watch out there. Those rental trends in terms of CapEx, now the CapEx can be somewhat lumpy and there are cycles to fleet refresh there, that we continue to learn about but they are pretty staggered in terms of how the customers come and go. We are pretty excited, we got some new products that we are launching there particularly in Light Tower side, that’s the one we haven’t talk much about probably should have to give the guys at Magnum they will do on this but they’ve done a fantastic job. We are the number one light tower provider to the global market and really number one here in the U.S. and we want to hold that position. We’ve got some pretty cool product coming down the line to kind of change the game a little bit on light towers. There is a lot of discussion around, the compactness of those products, the affordability of those products. I think a lot of the rental companies would tell you that probably one of the better performing piece of equipment from an ROIC standpoint on there a lot would be a light tower, and there is, it is good piece of equipment we’ve got some great scale in manufacturing there. We’ve been able to do some new things with Tower Light on light tower side. But we like the rental trends. We like the rental trends in Europe actually. We are starting to see some signs there that the current kind of economic malaise that has gone on in Europe is resulting a heightened interest in renting versus buying of again those types of pieces of support equipment like light towers, generators and pumps. So, we are anticipating that overtime the European market will follow some of the same growth curves that have occurred domestically here. So, we are pretty bullish on that.
Michael Halloran – Robert W. Baird & Co.: And then could you update us again on the capital deployment side obviously very strong cash generation expected again this year, any change to what the prioritization is from your perspective?
York A. Ragen: Mike this is York. No we pretty hold firm on our prior use of cash capital that we’ve been talking about ever since we went public like everybody you want to grow organically, we’ve talked about paying down debt but we are at our leverages today at 2.6 times we are in our target range so, you pretty quickly go to M&A as our third priority, and we talked at length as well on these calls about our M&A pipeline and we are fostering asset pipeline, we’ve talked about our relationships and I think we have demonstrated we can when something becomes actionable, we can move on the M&A side. So those are the top three priorities and then once we get through that at that point the board would evaluate the return of capital to shareholders, at that point but there is other some priorities above it.
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think Mike, I have a couple of comments to add, I mean I think we generated a lot of cash. We had almost $200 million of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. And obviously we didn’t announce any M&A deals in the first half, so although we have a robust pipeline, but sometimes M&A is about the timing of things and certainly about being disciplined in terms of the price that you paid for assets and so, if there were to be a situation where M&A activity would not occur, I mean obviously I think we would owe it to ourselves and our shareholders to continue to evaluate the best uses of that cash with respect to creating shareholder value. So, you can anticipate that our board will continue to monitor that very closely, and as we kind of move through the rest of the year here, if we don’t see the right kind of activity from an M&A standpoint that we want to see or we can get a deal done for the price we want to get the deal done for, then we’ll have to do something else with that cash.
York A. Ragen: Yes, we’ll monitor excess liquidity and the board will evaluate it.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Exactly.
Michael Halloran – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thanks guys, I appreciate the time as always.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Mike.
York A. Ragen: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Quealy from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity:  Hey good morning folks. So…
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hi John, how are you doing?
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity:  I’m doing all right, how are you? So, first question, back to this reversion of the mean in can we get quantify that a little more so for example, are you looking for two or three events of 100,000 outages like how do we gauge this like, what moves the needle for you guys when you say reversion to the mean is government data that we all track about outages, but how do we sensitize this to your comments.
York A. Ragen: Yes, John I mean again we track outages internally, we look at so instead of just raw outages and this is the problem with some of the public data that is available. Most of the public data is really kind of password relative (ph) just kind of available reporting from utility companies around the U.S. and we’ve actually developed some pretty cool proprietary index and we track internally here, that measure kind of combined not only the frequency of outages, but also the severity or the duration of those outages.  And so to answer your question, I mean, I can’t tell you with a high degree of specificity on this call, what that means in terms of whether that’s one big outage for seven days. It also regionally is important right, so you get these kind of echo effects that happen, if I – if we had an outage even a small one in maybe the northeast because that market has gone through a number of outages over the last couple of years, the impact of that small outage in that market could have a greater impact than it would be may in the midwest or maybe in the southwest. So, I mean it’s an (indiscernible) science although we are trying to put more science to it, it’s still there is not a great answer to the question. Reversion the mean comment and that concept is that on the long-term average in terms of what the number of people impacted by outages we were down against that long-term average in the first half of this year. And have been down against their long-term average for the last six quarters, as we mentioned. And so, the reversion of the mean here for the full year 2014, would mean some kind of increased outage activity in the back half of the year. So, again I can’t put my finger on exactly whether that’s four small outages or one big one or where it is. But that is kind of how I have to answer the question.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity:  Okay, that is fair. You mentioned some increased informercials and training and maybe some PowerPlay financing. I assume that is baked in your guidance. Can you talk about how much of a drag that is –is it 20 bps or 10 bps or not even. How do we think about the monetary aspects of the increased demand activities?
York A. Ragen: Yes, I don’t have that number directly in front of me. I mean that increased spending level though has been pretty much baked in our rate here. If you look at, in particular in Q2, I think Q2 is probably pretty solid indicator there, although you could see as it relates to from an informercial spend standpoint, we are kind of evaluating right now, how far do we want to go with that. Some of that depends on this reversion of the mean right I mean you don’t want to go overboard advertising. If you don’t have a lot of eyeballs that you’re hitting that haven’t experience some kind of an outage event. I mean that does not as effective advertising for us in this business. So we can be very pinpoint and very accurate, where we advertise but at the end of the day you do want to advertise in markets, where there has been outage activity. So, I do think that what we are seeing there – I think the run rate is from Q2 is probably a pretty good approximate. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Which is a lot more than we did last year. That is the key.
York A. Ragen: At this point last year which was the key to the comment, but you’re right, it includes training, it includes a lot of the advertising informercial spend. Continues to spending on the PowerPlay platform that is – it’s not cheap platform. I mean you put those applications together and all he back end. The iPad app is one thing, but all of the subsystems that go around it takes the lead, schedule the leads to improve that process and the metricking that comes out of that process, the amount of data that we are getting out of that process is phenomenal. And shifting through that to help us kind of direct what we need to focus on next is what we’re spending a lot of time and money on doing.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity: All right, great thanks guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, John.
York A. Ragen:  Thanks, John.
Operator:  Your last question will come from the line of Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please proceed.
Tim Mulrooney – William Blair & Co.: Good morning, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Tim.
York A. Ragen: Good morning, Tim.
Tim Mulrooney – William Blair & Co.:  Just a couple of clarification questions on the call here. First of all, can you guys tell us, may be you did, can you tell us exactly how much recent acquisitions contributed to C&I in the quarter.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We didn’t – necessarily in prepared comments. I can give you more color there. Looking at organic C&I in the second quarter, that was up year-over-year in the low single-digit. So of the 22% growth, the vast majority of that was acquisition-driven, low single-digit organic growth.
Tim Mulrooney – William Blair & Co.: Okay, so around $25 million. Is that a fair estimate for the acquisition revenue in the second quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Roughly.
Tim Mulrooney – William Blair & Co.: Roughly, okay. Okay. And then secondarily, do you guys still expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand 400 basis points in the second half from the first half?
Aaron Jagdfeld: In the outlook statement, actually we alluded to gross margins. So, we anticipate gross margins will go up about 150 basis points from first half to second half and that’s a higher resi mix, some price cost improvements. I know you’re going to leverage your SG&A in the second half more so than the first half. So that would play out around that level of increase first half, second half.
Tim Mulrooney – William Blair & Co.: Okay, great. And then just lastly, I was wondering if you guys could provide any more color on oil & gas opportunity. I know there have a lot of questions about that so far, but could you maybe just talk about how large this market is for your C&I business today or maybe how big of an opportunity you think this could be within the next several years? Thank you.
York A. Ragen: Thanks, Tim. So we don’t break specific protocols in detail, but I can tell you that in terms of trying to frame the discussion or how big it could be, that’s exactly what we’re kind of in the middle of right now. It’s just getting our arms around, some pretty detailed research and analysis around go-to-market strategies, resources needed, size of the market obviously being a component of the research. We think there’s a large opportunity there. We haven’t been able to quantify how large. And looking at how the market moves and what’s important to that, we’re starting to understand a bit of where generators and other supporting equipment are important to the customer, how they are used on the site or in the process whether it be upstream or downstream or midstream. So we’re starting to get a much better feel for that. And I think in the quarters to come we’ll be able to comment with a higher degree of confidence in terms of kind of qualifying the market side and the opportunity and for that matter our efforts to go after it. But at this point we’ll still kind of in the early innings of what we believe to be a high growth secular trend here towards opportunities in oil & gas for us.
Operator: Hi, ladies and gentleman. That will conclude the Q&A portion of the conference. I would like to turn it over to Aaron Jagdfeld for any closing remarks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you. We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to our third quarter 2014 earnings release, which we anticipate will be sometime in late October. Thank you again for your time this morning.
Operator: Ladies and gentleman, that will conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Analysts:  Jeffrey D. Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America Christopher D. Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity Charles D. Brady – BMO Capital Markets Matthew Rybak – Goldman Sachs & Co.  
Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Call. My name is Kathryn, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed, sir.
York A. Ragen: Thank you very much. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings call. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We’ll begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today’s call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliations to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We’re pleased with our overall first quarter results as they met our internal expectations, with revenue at a level consistent with historical seasonality as our lead times to residential products returned to more normalized levels entering 2014 as compared to the elevated levels, they were at entering the prior year first quarter. Our results further demonstrate the ongoing diversification of our business as continued growth in commercial and industrial products helped to offset the impact of harsh winter weather and home standby generator installations. First quarter net sales were $342 million as compared to $400 million in the first quarter of 2013. C&I product sales increased 24% during the quarter due to a combination of acquisitions and continued organic growth. As expected, residential products faced a strong prior year comparison as sales were $164 million compared to $255 million in the prior year quarter, which benefited from elevated demand due to the Superstorm Sandy. In addition, residential product sales during the first quarter were impacted by extreme cold temperatures and significant snow cover, which delayed the installation and slowed demand for home standby generators. As mentioned in the earnings release this morning, we are reaffirming our guidance for full year 2014 in terms of revenue growth, EBITDA margins, and free cash flow with solid year-over-year revenue growth to resume for the remaining quarters of the year. Looking beyond the first quarter, we’re seeing increased installation activity and demand for home standby generators in April. Going forward, we remain particularly focused on additional opportunities to increase the awareness of home standby generators using our innovative sales and marketing tools, including our A.M.P. targeted marketing process and infomercial advertising campaigns. The sales leads generated from these methods will be directed to our Generac lead team for qualification and in-home consultations will be scheduled homeowners through our PowerPlay in-home selling solution. The sales and marketing tools first became fully operational early last year and form an innovative and cost-effective approach to identifying and qualifying sales leads. In 2014, we will be focused on improving sales closure rates for home standby generators by further optimizing use of these tools. With only approximately 3% of U.S. households owning a stationary backup generator, there is a substantial opportunity to grow the category over the long-term. Our new product pipeline will continue to be an area of focus for us during 2014. Innovation has always been a part of Generac’s culture and is a core competency of our company. We have used the growth in our business over the past several years to accelerate our product development efforts by dramatically expanding our research and development capabilities. As a result, 2014 is expected to be another year of heavy product introductions particularly for residential products. New technologies rolling out in 2014 include the Guardian Synergy series. The industry’s first variable speed residential standby generator. Most generators operate at a constant speed to produce electricity, regardless of how much demand there is for the power. The patented variable speed technology we have developed in the Synergy Series allows the generator’s engine to run only as fast as necessary to meet the electrical load demand. The end result is a best-in-class, much quieter, more fuel efficient generator with exceptionally clean power output. In 2014, we also plan to launch our Power Pack series, a step up from our previous entry level core power product, which will combine all the benefits of automatic operation with many of the features found in our market leading Guardian series. With the 7 kilowatt unit starting at an affordable $1,899 at retail. Power Pack is a compact footprint of galvanneal steel enclosure for durability and is designed to streamline the installation process, thereby reducing the total cost of ownership and resetting the bar lower on the opening price point in the industry. In addition, we plan to launch our new Power Dial technology into the portable generator market this spring. This innovative feature dramatically simplifies the starting an operation of these products by incorporating the fuel valve, choke circuit and ignition all together in one single consumer touch point, making Power Dial generators the easiest to start and easiest to use portable generators on the market. These products will be available later this quarter at Lowe’s and other retailers. It’s new product introduction such as these that help to maintain our leading market share for residential products and are a big part of our ability to continue our track record of above average growth and premium earnings. Shifting over to C&I, sales of commercial and industrial products increased at a strong rate during the first quarter, driven by the Tower Light and Baldor Generators acquisitions, as well as solid organic growth. The strong momentum that we experienced during 2013 from our telecom national account customers continued during the first quarter of this year, as wireless providers in particular look to further safeguard their networks from future outages. We also saw some notable strength in the quarter from rental equipment customers in the U.S. as a result of improving trends in the oil and gas markets. A quick update here with regards to Baldor Generators and the integration of this recent acquisition, which remains a key corporate focus throughout 2014. Recall the Baldor offers a broad line of standby and prime rated products up to 2.5 megawatts and the addition of these products significantly expands our industrial product offering and manufacturing footprint, and essentially doubles the addressable domestic market that Generac and its distribution partners can serve. Although still early in the process, we are making good progress in strengthening our distribution as we work to combine the Generac and Baldor industrial networks. In addition, we have identified some meaningful product cost synergies given our increased manufacturing and sourcing scale as we transitioned the acquired products and facility into our portfolio. We are also particularly excited about the increased exposure the Baldor acquisition gives us to the oil and gas market within the U.S. and potential cross-selling opportunities with our Magnum mobile products business. Through these two acquisitions, we now have a broader product line of mobile gaseous fueled generators that are capable of running on well gas generated at the drilling site. Additionally, advances in drilling technologies over the past several years have created access to a significant supply of shale gas, which creates an attractive secular opportunity for mobile power equipment demand, including the need for support equipment, such as light towers, generators and pumps that are essential at these drilling sites. We expect the oil and gas market to be an increasingly important end market vertical for Generac going forward, as we positioned ourselves to participate in this potential long-term up cycle. Our Powering Ahead strategy has serviced the framework for the significant investments we’ve made during the last three years to drive penetration of our products including backup generators using residential, light commercial, and wireless telecommunications applications. While continuing to execute on the compelling secular penetration opportunities within these important end markets we remain focused on strengthening our leadership position in the overall markets we serve as well as providing diversification to our revenue base. As we continue to move the Powering Ahead plan into the future, we’re focused on a number of initiatives that are driven by the same four key objectives to grow the residential home standby by generator market, gain commercial and industrial market share, diversify our end markets and expand into new geographies. Combining this strategy with the long-term growth drivers for our business and the potential for further recovery in key macroeconomic indicators, we believe Generac is well positioned over the longer term to drive future growth and shareholder value. I’d now like to call, turn the call back over to York to discuss first quarter results in more detail.
York A. Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the first quarter of 2014 were $342 million as compared to $399.6 million in the first quarter of 2013, which benefited from elevated demand from Superstorm Sandy. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales were $164 million in the first quarter of 2014, as compared to $255.2 million for the comparable period in 2013. Shipments of residential products during the prior year first quarter of 2013 were positively impacted by approximately $100 million as we ramp production levels to satisfy the extended lead time that resulted from Superstorm Sandy. Lead times were at more normalized levels entering 2014 and as a result this dynamic did not repeat in the first quarter of 2014. Excluding this $100 million of benefit during the prior year quarter, residential product sales during the first quarter of 2014 increased 6% year-over-year, driven mainly by increased shipments for portable generators due to localized ice storms that impacted various regions of the U.S. during the current year quarter. As previously discussed, the harsh winter weather impacted installations and demand for home standby generators during the current year first quarter. Despite this severe winter weather, and excluding the prior year benefit from extended lead times, shipments of home standby generators were flat year-over-year as we were able to hold the new and hire base line level demand for these products. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales increased 23.8% to $157.4 million in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to $127.1 million in the first quarter of 2013. The increase in C&I net sales was driven by the acquisitions of Tower Light, which closed in August 2013 and Baldor Generators, which closed in November 2013 along with solid organic growth for stationary generators and light towers. The strength in organic C&I sales was primarily driven by an increase in shipments to certain national account customers highlighted by the telecom and equipment realm markets as the wireless cell tower and oil and gas secular opportunities continue to play out. Our other product sales category improved to $20.7 million in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of 19.8% from prior year first quarter sales of $17.2 million. This growth is primarily due to an increase in sales of service parts as the installed base of our products continues to grow with the overall growth of the company. Gross margin for the first quarter was 34.9% compared to 38.4% in the prior year first quarter. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to changes in sales mix compared to prior year. Most notably a higher mix of organic C&I product shipments, a lower mix of home standby generator sales and the addition of Baldor Generators acquisition. Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2014 declined $2.7 million or 4.8% as compared to the first quarter of 2013. The expense reduction was driven primarily by a decline in warranty expense as a result of warranty rate improvements in recent quarters. Partially offsetting this reduction, where the operate expenses associated with the acquisition of Tower Light and Baldor Generators. Excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during the first quarter of 2014 were 14.3%, representing a 160 basis point increase as compared to 12.7% in the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily the result of reduced leverage of operating expenses on lower sales volumes during the current year first quarter as compared to the prior year period was benefited from Superstorm Sandy. Adjusted EBITDA was $77.5 million or 22.7% of net sales in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to $108.8 million or 27.2% of net sales in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the current year quarter came in slightly ahead of our expectation. Compared to prior year, margins were unfavorably impacted due to the overall decline in gross profit margin and reduced leverage of operating expenses and the lower sales volumes in the current year first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months as of March 31, 2014 was $371.3 million or 26% of net sales. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2014 was $34.7 million as compared to $50.7 million for the first quarter of 2013. Adjusted net income as defined in our earnings release was $50.7 million in the current year quarter versus $83.9 million in the prior year first quarter. This decline over the prior year as a result of the previously discussed lower operating earnings during the quarter from decline in net sales and lower overall EBITDA margins along with the $5.4 million increase in cash income tax expense. These reductions were partially offset by $4 million in lower interest expense due to a reduction in interest rates from the May 2013 refinancing of our senior secured term loans. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.50 in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $0.73 per share in the first quarter of 2013. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconciled in our earnings release was $0.72 for the current year quarter compared to $1.21 per share in the prior year quarter. With regards to cash income taxes, the first quarter 2014 includes the impact of the cash income tax expense of $9.9 million as compared to $4.5 million in the prior quarter. As we commented during our last conference call, our cash income taxes for 2014 are expected to increase due to a combination of our NOL carry-forwards and certain tax credit carry-forwards becoming fully utilized during 2013, certain discrete tax deductions that were taken in 2013 that will not repeat in 2014, and to a lesser extent, higher overall pre-tax profitability levels. Cash income taxes for 2014 were previously estimated to be approximately $63 million to $65 million, translating to a full year 2014 cash income tax rate of 21% to 22%. Due to a higher level of benefit than previously expected from certain tax credits and discrete tax deductions during 2014, cash income tax expense is now projected to be approximately $55 million to $57 million, which translates into an anticipated full year 2014 cash income tax rate of 19% to 20%. As a reminder, even though we announced during the pay income taxes, our favorable tax shield through annual intangible asset amortization and our tax return remains intact through 2021, resulting in approximately $49 million of cash tax savings per year for the next eight years. As a result, our cash income tax rate is expected to be significantly lower than our now currently projected 34% to 36% GAAP income tax rate in 2014. As we drive higher profitability over time, cash income taxes can be estimated by applying a projected longer term GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% on pre-tax profits going forward and then deducting the approximately $49 million of annual cash tax savings from the tax shield each year through 2021. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $31.4 million in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to $33.9 million in the same period last year. The larger decline in operating earnings was mostly offset by less investment in working capital compared to the prior year, mainly due to a reduction in inventory levels in line with sales volumes during the first quarter of 2014. Free cash flow over the last 12 months was $226.7 million. As of March 31, 2014 we had a total of $1.2 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount, and $173.7 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $1.02 billion. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2.7 times, a level that is within our targeted range of 2 times to 3 times. Given our strong free cash flow profile, we are confident in our ability to continue to invest in the future growth of the business both organically and through M&A, while also evaluating other priority uses of cash. In April 2014, we made a voluntary prepayment of debt of $12 million that will be applied against our excess cash flow payment requirement in our credit facility, as well as against future term loan principle amortizations for the next 12 months. In addition, as a result of our credit agreement leverage ratio stepping below three times, our borrowing costs were declined by 25 basis points to 3.25%, beginning with the second quarter of 2014, which is reflected in our previous guidance. With that, I’d now like to turn the call back over to Aaron, to provide additional comments under our outlook for 2014.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. We are reaffirming our guidance for 2014 in terms of revenue growth, EBITDA margins and free cash flow. For full year 2014, net sales are still expected to increase in the mid single digit range as compared to the prior year. Importantly, this top line outlook continues to assume no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment, no major power outage events for the remainder of 2014, and does not include the potential impact from additional acquisitions. In summarizing our sales growth assumptions for the year, excluding the impact of the previously discussed headwind related to the first half 2013 production ramp to normalize product lead times, we still expect total organic year-over-year growth to remain between 9% and 11%. When including this headwind in prior year, we continue to expect organic growth to be approximately flat year-over-year in 2014. The acquisitions of Tower Light and Baldor Generators are still expected to contribute approximately 5% growth for a total year-over-year net sales increase in the mid-single digit range. We continue to expect the seasonality of quarterly results during the year to return to a more normal historical pattern, assuming no major power outage events during the year. As a result, we still expect the first half of the year to represent approximately 46% of total sales and the second half approximately 54% with the third quarter being the highest revenue quarter of 2014 and the first quarter being the lowest. When taking this into consideration, we continue to expect solid year-over-year revenue growth for the remaining quarters of the year. Consolidated gross margins for 2014 are now expected to decline slightly compared to our prior guidance, primarily as a result of a higher mix of C&I product shipments than previously expected. However, this incremental decline is expected to be fully offset by a slight incremental reduction in operating expenses. As a result, we are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for 2014 as we continue to expect margins to remain in the mid 20% range which is consistent with the average level seen during the past four years. Adjusted EBITDA margins during 2014 are still expected to experience some variation from quarter-to-quarter as a result of normal seasonality. As previously guided, the second half of the year is expected to be approximately 400 basis points higher than the first half, as a result of more favorable product mix, increasing synergies from acquisitions and additional SG&A leverage on higher sales volumes. We continue to expect to generate significant free cash flow in 2014, given our superior margin profile, capital efficient operating model, low cost of debt and favorable tax attributes. For full year 2014, we expect our conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow to be approximately 90%. In closing this morning, as we continue to execute on our Powering Ahead strategic plan and capitalize on the long-term secular growth drivers for our business, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow for the foreseeable future. With regards to our future allocation of capital, we expect our highest priority use of cash going forward to be focused on investing in the business to grow organically. We expect our second priority would be to pay down debt if our net leverage ratio exceeds approximately three times or if interest rates rise materially in the future. Our next priority use of cash is to seek strategic bolt-on acquisitions that are in line with our Powering Ahead strategic plan. Although our guidance for 2014 does not include any assumptions for additional acquisitions, we are currently working an active M&A pipeline and are well positioned from liquidity perspective to execute on additional opportunities that meet our acquisition criteria should be become actionable. Lastly, once we step through the first three priorities, and as future cash flow and liquidity permits, we will consider a further return of capital shareholders. Over the past three years, we believe we have demonstrated the effective use of our strong free cash flow by progressing through this capital allocation strategy. We’ll continue to follow this approach as we pursue additional shareholder value enhancing activities going forward. This concludes our prepared marks. And at this time, we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And please standby for your first question, which is from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead?
Jeffrey D. Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Hey. Good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey D. Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  So just a couple of things, it sounds like your kind of expectation on this $100 million and $40 million is kind of playing out, one, is that fair? And two, can you give us any kind of quantification or impact of kind of the weather delay and a little more clarity on what you’re seeing in 2Q on home standby that would suggest, maybe some kind of demand or normalization?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Hey, Jeff, this is your kind of first part, that the $100 million and the $40 million what you’re referring to is our previous statements, where that the headwind that we talked about that as we came into 2013 as a result of Superstorm Sandy, there was extended lead times, we ramped a production to satisfy those lead times, that’s a quantifiable number. It was, in total, for the first half 2013, it was $140 million, $100 million in the first quarter, $40 million in the second quarter. So that, that is playing out, because it’s a quantifiable number.
York A. Ragen:  And then Jeff, I think on the second part of your question, just the impact of weather, the winter weather on Q1 home standby in particular, it’s a little bit part of the seasonality that we normal seasonality, that we see in our business. In residential, in the winter months it’s more difficult to install these products that are outside, there is generally trenching involved and other things that, when the ground is frozen or there is three feet of snow become more challenging to do. So we typically see, as we say, we typically see Q1 being the lowest quarter. Obviously, the harsh, the harshness of this past winter is not something we’ve experienced since we’ve been in this category. And I think we saw some things that in terms of just physically not being able to put product on the ground in parts of the country that was really a challenging situation I think. But I think when we strip the back and we kind of look by region, one of the things that we do like is that in parts of the U.S., where arguably the harshness of the winter was not as maybe it wasn’t quite as bad, places in South Central, one of the regions we track, and the West, those regions were actually up in Q1 over the prior year. So in terms of installation. So I think what it tells us is a couple of things, I mean it tells us that clearly installations were down because of the weather as we would expect. But we like the underlying trends that are continuing in the home standby category and have continued for the better part of 12 years. So, we don’t see that changing dramatically. And as we go forward into April here, we continue to see as the weather warms up. As we would expect we see installation starting to pickup in those regions like the Northeast and the Midwest in particular, where I think the harshness of the winter probably impacted us the most. We’re starting to see that increase here in April. The cadence of installations, which we track, I think you’ll recall what we refer to as activations, which is every new home standby, they gets turned on, the minute it’s turned on we see it. We see exactly where it is and it gives us a tremendous amount of information. But it gives us a really good feel I think on what’s going on out in the end market relative to installs. Further upstream, when we look at proposals through PowerPlay and some of the other selling solutions that we put together here. Those have also picked up in April. So, we like the trends there, I think there is a lag of course that happens between when you do a proposal to when you sell a product and when it gets installed. So, I think whether there is pent-up demand to get to that, the route of your question I think is still a bit unable for us to comment on at this point. I think we like some of the trends, but we’re not sure if that demand is truly pent demand or if it’s something that we won’t get back. But I think we’ve adjusted our view points here accordingly by changing the mix a bit going forward with C&I being a bit stronger and resi being little bit lower. But to reflect that, frankly, I mean that’s really the outcome and it’s modeled here in our guidance that we’ve updated today.
Jeffrey D. Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just a couple of quick ones on commercial, one, can you give us the acquisition revenue in the quarter, and two is there a way to maybe size some of these bigger end markets within commercial like telecom, oil and gas, your regular commercial retail?
York A. Ragen:  Jeff it’s York. So C&I grew 23.8%, I think another way to answer your question. Our organic growth was 6%. So, and about 18% then was roughly acquisition driven.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah. I think in terms of sizing the end markets and the opportunity there and kind of framing that Jeff, I think I’ll step through just as you mentioned, because I think there are probably the most, the largest opportunity if you will. In telecom, we’ve said this before, there is roughly 300,000 wireless cell sites in the U.S. and today roughly 30% of those sites have backup power in the form of a generator. And so, when we talk in terms of penetration rate opportunity, we talk in the residential side, we’re only at 3%, and where does that ultimately top out, is it double-digits, kind like portable generators are 15% of household. When we talk about telecom, I think it’s conceivable that you could see a topping out there, something much closer to 100% in my viewpoint, much more, many more critical communications whether be data or voice are shifting to wireless and the proliferation of mobile devices, obviously is pushing that, and if that happens, what we’ve seen is in our telecommunications customers in particular is a move towards hardening their networks. Now, the cadence of that move can shift from quarter-to-quarter. I mean that the way they released capital dollars, deploy them, and the way they arrange the project management for installations can move from quarter-to-quarter, but I think the long-term view on telecom is that both 300,000 sites eventually will need some kind of backup power and even have situations now where you’ve got FEMA is out there promoting the fact that we’re sending text messages to people to give them advance notification and warning about storms that are coming towards them. Tornadoes, bad weather, you got to text at your mobile phones saying take shelter immediately. Well, that’s all well and good as long as the cell network is up. And the problem is, when you get poor weather, that’s generally when the cell network goes down. So for some of these advanced warning systems and these kind of critical communication and warning systems to work and operate flawlessly, we believe and we continue to take a view of that, the hardening of the telecommunications network is a long-term opportunity. In oil and gas, that’s one I’m trying to get my arms around in terms of quantification. It’s relatively new for us. I mean, we had some exposure that we kind of acquired into a few wells through the Magnum acquisition a couple of years ago, but that’s really accelerated with Baldor, one of the nice bright spots of the Baldor acquisition has been. Their penetration into the oil and gas market as it relates to natural gas or propane-powered mobile gensets. That really run-off a wellhead gas. So and there is some regulation changes coming in terms of the ability to flare gas off. So the need to consume that gas or store it, refine it and sell it, is going to become of greater importance to the energy companies that are extracting it. And so we see an opportunity not only in the support equipment, I mean, the mobile equipment like light towers and mobile gens and even to an extent mobile pumps, that really are the support equipment for the production activities on the drilling sites. That’s been great for us as well to our rental accounts, but also, these natural gas-fired gen sets and other products that we have the opportunity to help them consume some of that. Otherwise, kind of flare it off and lost gas and turn it into power at the site instead of trying to use diesel gen set and the logistics around diesel and the cost of operating diesel gen sets, effectively the gas is free in kind of around about way until there is some really good opportunities. And we’re truly trying to quantify it still, so I’m going to shy away from giving you any discrete numbers there. I think, one of the things that we do watch is kind of the number of new drilling sites, the number of new, the rig count that’s kind of become an indicator that we’re watching with greater importance and greater interest, it seems to correlate to some of the needs of the support equipment that goes on those sites, so that’s something we’ve watched little closer. And then the last category that’s the kind of regular kind of commercial building backup or what we refer to the optional standby market, this is the market that, depending on your source, it’s in excess of 10 million buildings out there that we’re an optional standby generator. You could help a business protect its revenue stream, protects it perishable inventory and cases, provide security during outages. We have done a lot here in the last 12 months to 18 months, really on the heels of events like Sandy and Irene to take advantage of the increased awareness of the option standby category for these businesses to have backup power. And so I think quantifying that we believe that the penetration rates today in those installations are still in kind of that mid-single digit range. So there’s a lot of upside, it looks a lot like home standby in terms of, not only the upside potential but also the work that we have to do to educate business owners on just how cost-effective it is to have a generator. We demonstrated the payback model for some businesses, in particular we get into restaurants, small restaurants and other things like that where a generator can be paid for and as little as a 24 hour outage. So I think it’s a very strong payback model in certain businesses and certain verticals, and I think it’s something that we look forward to and again its one of the reasons why we’ve invested very heavily in our C&I business overall, all these things that we talked about. So we really like the performance of that business, it continues to perform well. It’s going to continue to perform well throughout 2014 as we look at the year here is shaping up and we’re excited about it.
Jeffrey D. Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Thanks, Chip.
Operator:  Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America:  Hi, good morning guys, thanks very much.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Hey Ross.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America:  I just wanted to clarify couple of things. So what do you say about a shipments of home standby in the first quarter, did you say they were flat year-on-year?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  So, if you take out this extended lead time concept from the first quarter 2013, if you carve that out, which was a piece of that, a large piece of that $100 million that recording, the vast majority of that $100 million that recording in the release related to that extended lead time benefit in the first quarter 2013. You carve that out Ross, and we’re actually please that we were actually flat with home standby year-over-year...
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America:  The harsh winter I mean...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  With that harsh winter, yeah.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America:  Okay. And within Europe your comments about I think you’re expecting organic growth to be positive for the entire company for the remaining three quarters of the year, is that what you were saying?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  When you exclude, again when you exclude that headwind that we just talked about, we expect it to relatively – there will be revenue growth overall...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  If you exclude that, it’ll be flat when you include that.
York A. Ragen:  Yes, yes.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America:  But, I was talking for the remaining three quarters of the year.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  The remaining...
York A. Ragen:  The remaining three, because that’s a full year, so for the remaining three quarters of the year I guess we have to look at that.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America:  Okay. I mean what was your...
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah, for the remaining three quarters if you add them all up...
York A. Ragen:  Yeah, there’ll be growth.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah.
York A. Ragen:  Yeah, correct. That’s the true statement, Ross.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America:  Okay. And how about on standby, if you take out the $40 million in Q2 of 2013, would you expect that to be up year on year in Q2?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  I guess we didn’t give that level of discreet granularity there with the mid-single digit guidance that we are talking about, flat organic mid-single digit. And we did talk about 46% of our sales would be in the first half, which I think you will be able to, so that’s total company. We didn’t get that level of granularity there Ross, but you’re, so I was thinking that $40 million of that $140 million headwind will be in the second quarter, so you need to carve that out, when you’re looking at comparisons for the second quarter.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America: Okay. And the harsh winter, did it help clear out some of the excess inventory in portables in the chain that was there as a result of lack of hurricanes?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah, it did. I mean, I don’t think when we look at those – when we look at what happened in Q1 with weather, there were a couple of ice storms and things, we wouldn’t have classified any of that as major, first of all. I think that’s fairly, I suppose, if you looking through them, they were major, but from our perspective in terms of the raw number of the people and the duration of the outages they wouldn’t qualify as a major outage, but they did to your point, Ross they help clear out some of the excess point, where inventory to the point where retail inventory levels of portable generators feel about right now both for the retailers and for where we are at coming into the season. So I think we wouldn’t expect to see a tremendous amount of, but there’s a couple puts and takes, some of the retailers perform a little bit better with weather, when there is weather, then others, but across the board, across the line portable generator inventories feel about right at this point. So, they don’t feel heavy as a result of some of that clear out.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America: Okay. Great. And then you made reference to some operating cost savings that will help offset some of the mix erosion from having higher mix of C&I this year. Could you go into a little bit more detail on the nature of some of these things and help quantify at all?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah. So I think a couple of things there, Ross. I mean some of it just a little bit tighter operating cost management. Again it’s a pretty slight kind of offset, but at the end of the day, some of those costs are, I think, just being a little more prudent on whether it’s advertising or whether it’s some other things that might have been a little bit more exploratory, if you will, or little bit more advance. We just basically dial a couple of things back, but nothing that will impact really for us anyway, any of the programs or any of the initiatives that we have going on in any material way. I mean I think that’s kind of the key. It’s just a little bit better tighter expense management. We’ve grown quite a bit. We’ve integrated subs into our SG&A line. So kind of rationalizing some of the expenses there at the subsidiary levels alongside with what we do and kind of tightening up or structure a little bit. I think there’s a little bit of cost optimization to do there.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America: Okay. Great guys. And just my last one. Can you talk a little bit more about the trends you’re seeing internationally given some of the softness outside of North America, particularly with Tower Light and Ottomotores?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah. So we’ve obviously got a little bit better view now into some things outside the U.S. and Canada through those entities. I think I’ll speak to Latin America first. I think Latin America, I think, maybe has underperformed to just broader expectations in terms of the economies down there, based on not only some of the geopolitical things going on, the political environment in some of those countries, but even in Mexico where Ottomotores is the leader in the commercial industrial market there. Mexico in particular went through an administration change last year and continues to be a little bit slow to let loose some of the spending through the new government there. And so, that’s I think delayed a little bit of what we would have expected to this point with Ottomotores. We’re doing a lot of good things in that business to get the foundation ready for growth. The business, as we had mentioned previously, was fairly neglected in terms of investment over the years through the previous owner. And so we had quite a bit of work to do down there and it’s been quite a learning experience for us and we’ve been on a pretty steep learning curve from the last year just culturally as well as just doing a lot of work with that business and that team down there to understand the markets in Mexico and Latin America and how they operate, transact and what we need to do to optimize our arrangement in our operations there. I would say that in Brazil where we also have an operation through the Ottomotores acquisition, I think personally for us, we’ve seen some little bit probably brighter skies there simply because we’ve resourced a little more heavily on sales and marketing and done some things there that I think are going to help us longer term. I don’t know if they’re indicative of the broader Brazilian economy. I think everything there would also indicate continued slowness, but I think we’re outperforming a bit there. Our feeling is, we’re going to outperform there based on what we’ve done to resource that. Now, it’s on a very small base. So don’t get overly excited. And then over in Europe, with Tower Light, I think we saw better economy in the UK and we saw continued weakness in boarder Europe, I think it is how we would place kind of our view points through the rental markets in particular that we serve, that would really be the best viewpoints that we would have. There was a significant amount of – kind of weather-related issues, even though the broader economy in UK feels better, they had a very damp spring, winter spring, very wet, especially in southern UK, southern England. And so in terms of job sites and rentals, little more challenging environment there in southern Europe and southern England then and we anticipate that it will be for the rest of the year. So we like that company though and where its headed, a lot of good things going on, Tower Light as well is a well run company and we’re trying to figure out how we can extend their product platform and extend their importance to their customers in the rental markets through kind of some synergies, product synergies that we can bring to them through here.
Ross P. Gilardi – Bank of America: Okay. Thanks very much guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Thanks, Ross.
York A. Ragen:  Thanks, Ross.
Operator:  The next question is from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher D. Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.:  Thanks, good morning.
York A. Ragen:  Hi, Chris.
Christopher D. Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.:  Hey, York. So previously you had been a little more specific on res, I think setup 10% to 12% excluding the 140, just why don’t if you could try to back on that?
York A. Ragen:  Yeah, I think based on some of Aaron’s comments, we did dial that back in based on some of the views here with the harsh winter weather, it was slight though, I mean it was maybe a couple percent off of that, so it wasn’t a big change.
Christopher D. Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.:  Okay. Thanks. And then wanted to just dive in a little bit into your comments on the long-term shift to the rental of mobile power equipment. What behaviors are changing exactly in the secular basis? And are the rental company’s customer service operations improving?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  That’s our view on it. I mean there’s a couple of key things, I think that underpin that secular shift to renting versus buying. One is, I think coming out of the economic slowdown here over the last several years, many of the smaller construction firms – they found that during those downturn, they had a significant mismatch of, they owned the equipment, they had a note from the bank against the equipment but they had no revenue to utilize the equipment. So in those instances, rental would have been much more beneficial to them and in a lot of cases either that equipment was repossessed or returned or sold off which created kind of a further dampening effect on those markets several years ago especially like 2009 right before our ownership of that business in the preceding years, which were more difficult. But, so I think the ability to kind of better match expenses with revenues for those smaller construction companies is a big plus on rental. The other thing is access to capital, that’s been more challenging for small businesses, maybe starting to loosen up a bit here over the last 6 month to 12 months, but traditionally I mean those small businesses could go to their local lenders and get a loan and buy the equipment. The ability to do that has been dramatically reduced over the last several years, that coming out of the downturn. So access to capital and then I think matching of revenues to expenses is the primary mover there. But what we’ve seen is the rental companies really capitalize on this shift and in particular, I mean we serve all the major rental accounts through the Magnum business and somewhat through the Baldor business, and they have continued to refine their model. They’re very focused on equipment utilization, but they’re focused on providing customers much more than just an equipment rental. They provide them with the service level for refueling, they provide them often times with in particular, in the case of long-term rentals, they provide them with maintenance agreement so they take care of the equipment. So basically, you can think of it, and we mentioned as if you think about the oil and gas markets in particular, where our light tower, per say, they use light towers in these drill sites where they don’t have primary power available, there is no utility power. So, and so there is no lighting. And so they operate some of these drill sites operate 24/7 or throughout in Canada, where daylight is shorter during the winter months, like towers are very prevalent. And so what you’ll find though is they will go out on long-term rental agreements and essentially what the rental company is renting is just the light. They are not really, the sites says, hey, we need this much light or this much power on a site, the rental company provides the equipment to do that, and then all the services behind it from refueling the maintenance to keep the equipment up. And so that’s really the model, they’ve refined it quite a bit, and I think that it’s again, I think it’s a reason why we see that long-term secular trend taking hold, and why we like the fact that we’re in good position to benefit from that going forward with the Magnum business and the Baldor business.
Christopher D. Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Thanks, Chris.
Operator:  The next question is from the line of Charlie Brady from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Charles D. Brady – BMO Capital Markets:  Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Hey, Charlie.
York A. Ragen:  Hey, Charlie.
Charles D. Brady – BMO Capital Markets:  Can you just talk a little bit, you talked about new portable product going into Lowe’s and Home Depot later this year. Is there a sort of a channel fill that helps out one quarter versus another, and was that baked into prior guidance?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  That is the case, that’s the way it works. Charlie, in that case, that product that we mentioned is going to Lowe’s, and there will be a loading on that late in Q2, early Q3 ahead of the season. And that’s really reflected in our guidance. We kind of take into consideration the impact of product launches on and the timing of those launches quarter-to-quarter. Typically with standby launches, there is not much of a load-in, but there is when you get into portable generators and power washers.
Charles D. Brady – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay. Thanks. That’s helpful. And just on the Baldor deal, maybe you mentioned and I missed it. You talked a little bit about synergies that you’re seeing in there. I mean, can you quantify that a little bit more, be a little more granular on kind of what you’re seeing now as you’ve owned it for a little bit relative to when you bought it and maybe get some numbers around what’s kind of synergy you might see a little bit longer term?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah. So, are you speaking more in terms of cost synergies, Charlie, or product synergies, revenue synergies?
Charles D. Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Well, I guess I’m probably speaking of both.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Some question on my part. Of course you are. So on the product cost side, right now, what we’re seeing is we’re coming in line with the synergies that we kind of expected. I don’t think we provided any discrete numbers around that, but we think there is a significant upside to the business. That business was very sub-optimized from a class perspective as we said, I think when we talked about that when we announced a deal in the fourth quarter call, we talked a bit about Baldor. The margins in that business were not where we would expect to see and as a result when we peeled the onion back on that, we did this during our diligence and we continued to execute on this. Really a lot of that’s on the sourcing side, but then also on the optimization of the manufacturing footprint. And this is one of the reasons why we really like this business, we’re kind of busting at the scenes. Our C&I business as we talked has been growing pretty rapidly here over the last several years, as we made that a much bigger part of Generac and we’ve run our space. So we had to do something about that. It’s one of the main reasons why we really like the Baldor acquisition and we’ve got a big beautiful facility, built, purpose built for these types of products. And so the better utilization in that facility, the sourcing synergies that we’re going to get. Those are kind of really meaningful things that are going to start to progress into the back-half of this year, that’s going to start to show up. And so, there is a lag analysis that you do, you had to run through their inventory and ramp up to the new stuff, but really, it’s some of the numbers are really startling in terms of, just on a component level. What we see in terms of opportunities there. So really excited, that’s the cost side, without giving too granular revenue side. I think this has been a little bit of an area of upside surprise for us as we got into it. We liked what they were doing in certain end market verticals, but I don’t think what we really understood, even though we caught it during diligence was just their kind of the breath of their exposure to oil and gas. They’ve really staked out a nice position there. It’s a niche space, no doubt, but we were able to take their kind of exposure through certain customers. They serve certain, I will call them kind of specialty rental companies focused in power, providing those types of back-up power, rental power to the oil and gas industry. We’re customers of Baldor and what we’ve been able to do is take our capabilities in gas technology, combine that with our cost position, our kind of sharp cost position with mobile gen sets at Magnum. Put that together and take it to Baldor’s customer base. So it’s kind of a, it’s kind of what you’d always hope to see when you do acquisitions is, is to kind of knit those things together in a very cohesive way. It doesn’t always work that way, but in this case, we think that it’s really been beneficial, because we’re able to take our gas technology and our ability to operate the engines on natural gas and propane, very cost effectively, put them on wheels and skid mounted basis, and take them out to the oil fields and gas fields through the Baldor customer base, and it’s been very well received and that’s a cycle; there is an up cycle. There is no question that what we’ve seen through the first quarter of this year and what the expectation is for the balance of this year is the oil and gas is going to continue to grow. We see that as we called out a number of times as an upside from a long-term secular growth trend for natural gas gensets in general, but I think broader than that is just the production side of that, the extraction and production of oil and natural gas in this country. We really like our exposure of that now through Baldor and that’s one thing I would say as an upside through the acquisition that has become a little bit more evident to us here recently.
Charles D. Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Great and on the gross margin impact, can you quantify, maybe you did, the mix impact on gross margin in the quarter?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah, it was effectively almost all of it. There was a modest level of price cost, but it was very small, so the vast majority of the gross margin delta year-over-year was mix related.
Charles D. Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And one more from me, and I’ll get back in the queue here. On the M&A pipeline, you talked a little bit about looking at your fire power for that, I know it’s a little farther down maybe on the list of capital allocation uses, but can you give us a sense of kind of – if you look at Tower, you’ve obviously got the Towers, you’ve got the Baldor deal, but are there product lines that tie into what you’re doing or is it, give us a sense of the geographies or give us a sense of kind of what you’re thinking about when you talk about M&A pipeline?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah, it’s really, it’s both, Charles. I mean it’s both geography and as we’ve called out a number of times and I mean I think when we look at things like Tower Light, you look at things like Magnum, some of the other products that they come with those acquisitions that are, I wouldn’t – they are not generators, but they’re engine powered equipment. We view those spaces as right spaces, so if you look at our pipeline, which we don’t give discrete comments on, but if you look at that pipeline, it would have a mix in there of engine powered equipment companies that would have a mix of other generator through generator companies in other geographies or other engine powered companies in other geographies. So I would say this, that we’ve been working very hard on that M&A pipeline over the last four years, and I think we have – not everything is actionable, it’s right, it’s about timing in a lot of cases and good asset spreads in certain businesses and industries, but at the end of the day, we think we got a lot of opportunities there. So your comment that it’s lower on the priority standpoint. Again we’re as we said just kind of stepping through that. The first priority for use of cash is to grow the business organically. When you kind of have kind of margins we got, we want to put as much capital against that as we can, but that’s you kind of get. There is a bit of point of diminishing returns there just in terms of bandwidth your ability to execute.
York A. Ragen:  CapEx.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  So CapEx only about 2% of sales, when you look at our working capital needs on every dollar of sales. As we grow, it’s about 20%, so it doesn’t eat up a lot of cash that way and paying down debt, which is our second priority. We said that we kind of like where we are at right now. The liability structure we built is very cost effective. In fact, in our prepared remarks, our borrowing costs stepped down another 25 basis points here beginning in Q2 because we’re sub three times on our leverage ratio. So that’s a nice little feature that makes the debt structure even more attractive, so we are sub three times on leverage. We don’t see borrowing cost dramatically increasing. If interest rates went up dramatically, we would probably focus little more heavily on debt pay down, but in the meantime we kind of get our sight set on M&A and organic growth, so that’s really where we’re focused.
Charles D. Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Great. Thanks very much, Aaron.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Thanks, Charlie.
Operator:  The next question is from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Matthew Rybak – Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Good morning, and it’s Matt Rybak on behalf of Jerry. How are you?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Good, Matt. How are you?
York A. Ragen:  Hey, Matt.
Matthew Rybak – Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Very well, thanks. Portables were strong in the first quarter despite what sounded like a pretty full channel heading into the quarter. Could you just give us an update on any sort of inventory restock you’re seeing in April in the portable side and how we should think about the run rate going forward?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah, I think Matt my comments previously here on kind of where inventory levels are on portables. We feel that right now we look at our – we have a fairly decent insight, we’re the number one market share player in portable generators, so we have a pretty good insight into what’s going on in the channel as well as what’s going on inside Generac, but we feel that inventory levels are kind of right size right now. So we don’t see a lot of load-in in Q2 for additional portables, minus some of the new products that we talked about with Power Dial, and that’s reflected in our guidance. I think our portable shipments in Q1 to your point were a little bit better than what we are originally expecting and that was really the result, the direct result of some of the events that happened in Q1. It was not only the combination of drawing down some of those portable Gen levels to more normalized levels, but also taking some inventory from us. The draw down was low from us as well as of retail channel levels, and then – but it drove down to a level that everybody is kind of comfortable with going forward into the season, so that’s kind of how I would characterize it.
Matthew Rybak – Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Great. And then on the Baldor acquisition, can you say more about how the distribution you structure and the C&I business is shaping up after the deal and update us on how the representation decisions are coming along?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah, it’s a great question and it’s been a huge area of focus for us over the first quarter and here into April, and we started to make announcements in assigning different territories to distribution through a combination of our existing Generac dealers as well as the addition of a couple of Baldor dealers into that and some new dealers. Those are things that – that’s coming on very well. It’s not complete yet. I like where we’re at in the cycle. I mean, what happens when you do that in some of the markets where we’ve got changes that are occurring. Because you have a long sale cycle in C&I products, bringing in new dealer up to speed is something that takes a while. So it’s a little bit of a – you got to take a step backward to take two steps forward, market-to-market, but at the end of the day, we’re going to end up with a much stronger distribution position overall than we had before the Baldor acquisition. And that’s I think the important thing I would say, this is the second thing that we’ve done there is we created a much stronger second tier of distribution than we had before. So what we’ve just been talking about is the primary care distribution for C&I. There is now a formalized second tier of distribution, we have a specific program, we call it GAIN. It’s a Generac authorized industrial network. We’re going to take and create a secondary distribution network, a secondary level of distribution that will take, I would say, what we referred to as kind of smaller dealers who want to have access to industrial product, because they have – they see opportunities in their local markets that perhaps the primary dealer doesn’t, but they will work with the primary distribution in the market. It’ll be at a set price and there’ll be programs to not only promote that, but also to make that work from a program element standpoint. So that’s brand new for us. That didn’t exist before, that second layer of distribution. We’re pretty excited, because actually what it’s taken is, it’s taken some of our larger residential dealers who want to kind of grow into becoming broader generator dealers and be a little more inclusive of broadening their product line to include C&I, and allow them access to that product where they didn’t have access before. So that’s kind of an interesting new development for us that was a result of this combination of the industrial dealer networks. We felt that they were some really good dealers that came out of that combination, but that maybe we’re not, where you had multiple dealers in a region and it didn’t make sense to just say good bye to two or three of those dealers and made sense to put a program together to support them and that’s effectively a pretty significant change for us in terms of distribution philosophy going forward.
Operator:  Thank you. The last question is from the line of John Quealy from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity:  Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Hi, John.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity:  First on the residential side, obviously you had a tough compare in Q1 with Superstorm Sandy, but can you talk about the dealer churn. I imagine the dealers last year, I think, you added something nearly 200 dealers. I imagine that’s down commensurately and how you’re looking at dealer growth or churn in 2014 on the standby product?
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Yeah. I mean, it’s a great question, John. Again, we had a pretty good cadence on dealer adds, on a net basis between 300 dealers and 400 dealers every year the last year. That was actually above – we’re about that last year. I don’t have the exact number in front of me, but it was something 500 to 550, I think. 550 dealers, we added last year. Now, obviously that’s seasonal as well, right. So, that does the cadence of distribution adds or dealer adds on a net basis somewhat follows our residential sales pattern seasonally. So Q1 was more challenging there, but we’re still holding to back into that normal cadence of between 300 net dealers and 400 net dealers on an annual basis. So, we would expect that to pick up in the remaining quarters here throughout 2014. And again I think we have by far the largest distribution network in this category and you would expect that from the 70% plus market share leader, in fact our market share is crapped up a bit here in Q1, so we think we’re doing well to continue to not only hold on to our share and it’s things like distribution ads and it’s things like new products and some of the things we talked about, but again it’s distribution is an enormous part of that strategy and an enormous part of our success here over the last decade in terms of building this business.
Operator:  Thank you. I’d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks.
Aaron P. Jagdfeld:  Great. Thank very much for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you again on our second quarter earnings call, which should be sometime in late July of this year. Thanks, and have a good day.
Operator:  Thank you for joining today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. And have a very good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2013 Generac Holdings Incorporated earnings conference call. My name is Janeda, and I will be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.
York Ragen: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and CEO. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I'll now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter 2013 results provide further evidence that our Powering Ahead strategy continues to be successful, as fourth quarter net sales increased 10% to $376 million over a very strong prior year quarter, which included Superstorm Sandy. Our revenue growth during the fourth quarter is a great example of the improving diversification of our business, as the combination of strong organic revenue growth for home standby generators and commercial and industrial products along with the revenue contribution from recent acquisitions more than offset a meaningful decline in shipments of portable generators. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased 25% and 28%, respectively, with EBITDA margins increasing 320 basis points over the prior year, primarily as a result of an overall improvement in gross margin and ongoing improvements in warranty rates. Before further discussing additional details of the quarter and our outlook, I wanted to review some highlights for 2013 as well as important accomplishments within some key strategic areas of our business that made for another impressive year of growth for Generac. 2013 was another record year for the company in terms of revenue, adjusted earnings and free cash flow. Revenue increased 26% to $1.5 billion over a prior year 2012, where revenue increased 49% over 2011. Once again, we experienced strong growth across all regions of the United States, as home standby generators continue to gain popularity and the Generac brand is increasingly recognized as a leading name in backup power. Revenue growth within residential products in 2013 exceeded our original expectations, due to better than expected adoption upon standby generators, continued to expansion of our distribution, execution on sales and marketing initiatives and a more favorable environment for residential investment. With regard to our commercial and industrial products, we experienced our third consecutive year of mid-teens organic growth as the secular penetration themes associated with this business continue to play out, including the increased awareness and growing importance of backup power within the telecommunication, unlike commercial markets as well as the industry shift toward cleaner-burning, more cost-effective natural gas fuels backup generators. Supplementing our organic growth during 2013 were three important acquisitions that provide additional product breadth and global scale to our C&I business and an overall better balance for the company. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year increased 39% to $403 million as compared to 2012. And free cash flow during 2013 totaled $229 million. Our consistent track record of strong cash flow generation combined with our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to pursue a number of shareholder value enhancing activities, as we enter 2014. Specifically, regarding our residential products, our residential dealer base continue to expand in 2013, as we entered the fourth quarter with approximately 5,400 dealers. We added dealers at a pace above historical rates with approximately 550 net dealers joining our network during the year and with over 1,100 net dealers added since the end of 2011. Furthermore, the growth in home standby generators that we experienced in 2013 can be attributed to the significant progress we made during the year, with targeted sales and marketing initiatives to further extend and increase the awareness of home standby generators. We expanded our efforts with the amp targeted marketing process and fully launched our Power You Control infomercial, Generac Lead Team and PowerPlay in-home selling solution. These four elements are interconnected and form an innovative and cost-effective approach to identifying and qualifying sales leads and improving sales closure rates for home standby generators. Through these initiatives, we are better aligning our residential dealer base with Generac and extending our competitive advantage. We plan to further investment in these important sales and marketing efforts during 2014, as we continue to execute on our strategic objective to grow the overall residential standby generator market. Generac created the market for this emerging category over a decade ago, and as a result we have established a 70% market share. During 2013, we achieved a significant milestone by manufacturing and selling our 1 million home standby generator into the market. Having said that there remains a substantial opportunity to further grow this category, as only approximately 3% of U.S. households own a home standby generator. 2013 was also an important year for expanding our commercial and industrial product portfolio, as we executed on a number of strategic M&A-related activities through the integration of Ottomotores and the acquisitions of Tower Light and Baldor Generators. We made solid progress on a number of integration initiatives involving Ottomotores, which we acquired in December of 2012, including significant changes to the supply base for certain key components, consolidating the operating footprint and implementing new information technology systems. While, ongoing integration efforts will continue throughout 2014, Ottomotores remains an essential platform for our international expansion effort, by providing a local manufacturing presence and access to the important Latin American market for power generation. In August, we acquired Tower Light, a leading European developer and supplier of mobile light towers with headquarters outside Milan, Italy. With distribution in over 50 countries, Tower Light is a great strategic fit for our business, providing our first manufacturing footprint in Europe and expanded product offering to support additional geographic markets. When combined with Magnum, this acquisition positions Generac as a global leader in light towers, allowing us to participate in the growing domestic and international rental markets. Tower Light has an established history of profitable growth and we have identified several attractive revenue and cost synergies, as we further integrate this acquisition. In November, we purchased substantially all of the generator division assets of Baldor Electric Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ABB Group. Baldor generators offers a complete line of standby and primary products up to 2.5 megawatts and immediately expands our existing industrial product line, adds to our manufacturing capacity for industrial products, and essentially doubled the addressable market for Generac and our distribution partners in U.S. and Canada. The integration of Baldor generators will be a key corporate focus throughout 2014. Although, still early in the process, we have identified some meaningful cost synergies with regard to product costs, given our increased manufacturing and sourcing scale, as we transition the acquired products and facility into the Generac portfolio. All three of these acquisitions are focused on improving our C&I scale by providing us access to new products, end-markets, geographies and customers. As we look forward, we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand into other regions of the world, which is important to enhancing to our overall competitiveness and achieving our long-term goal of becoming a leading payer in the worldwide market for power generation equipment that is estimated to be up to $18 billion annually. Innovation continues to be a core value of Generac and an important element of our future growth. We introduced a number of new products during 2013, while also developing a robust portfolio of future projects. Our new lineup of Guardian Series home standby generators introduced during 2013 included more than 85 product enhancements and innovations across the entire product line, focused on improving the user experience and streamlining the installation process. Alongside, the new Guardian Series, we also introduced a new cellular-based remote monitoring system called Mobile Link, which allows our customers to check the status of their generator conveniently from a desktop PC, tablet computer or mobile phone and also provides them with a capability to receive maintenance or service alerts. In addition, in late 2013, we introduced the Protector Series product line, developed specifically for residential and light commercial users. This new line of compact diesel generators offers the industry smallest footprint at price points well below those of larger, more traditional diesel products in the marketplace. We also added to our industry-leading lineup of natural gas generators during the year, with the introduction of several new power nodes up to 400 kilowatts. We believe our ability to innovate is something that separates us from others in our industry, and we have used the growth in our business over the past several years to accelerate our product development efforts and dramatically expand our research and development capabilities. As a result, we expect 2014 will be another important year of new product launches across our business. Our Powering Ahead strategy has been guiding our investments in Generac for the last three years, allowing us to capitalize on the compelling secular growth drivers for our business and contributing to the transformation of Generac into a more diverse and globally-focused company. As we continue to move our Powering Ahead plan into the future, we are focused on a number of initiatives that are driven by the same four key objectives; to grow the residential home standby generator market, gain commercial and industrial market share, diversify our end-markets and expand into new geographies. Combining the strategy with the long-term growth drivers for our business and the potential for further recovery in key macroeconomic indicators, we believe Generac is well-positioned over the long-term to drive future growth and shareholder value. I'd now like to turn the call back over to York to discuss fourth quarter results in more detail. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2013 were $376.2 million, a 10% increase as compared to $342 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, which includes the impact from Superstorm Sandy. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales were $199.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, as compared to $216 million for the comparable period in 2012. Shipments of home standby generators experienced strong growth in comparison to the prior year, as we continue to expand our leading position for these products through our innovative approach to the market. The continued strength in home standby shipments is due to the similar combination of factors discussed during recent quarters, including the additional awareness created by major power outages in recent years, expanded distribution broadening the availability of the product and increased sales and marketing initiatives to create and close leads more effectively. The strength in home standby generators, however, was more than offset by a meaningful decline in shipments of portable generators, due to less severe power outage events in the fourth quarter of 2013 relative to the prior year. The prior year fourth quarter benefited from increased demand from portable generators from Superstorm Sandy. Recall that, immediately before, during and shortly after major power outages, demand for portable generators increases significantly. Following the outage and for a period of time after, we see elevated demand for automatic home standby generators, and given the increased awareness and distribution that has created a new and higher base line of demand established for these products. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales increased 42.7% to $157.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $110.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in C&I net sales was driven by the acquisition of Ottomotores, Tower Light and Baldor Generators, along with strong organic growth for stationary and mobile generators. The strength in organic sales was primarily driven by a significant increase in shipments to certain national account customers, highlighted by the telecom vertical, as well as increase sales of natural gas generators used in light commercial and retail application. Our other product sales category improved $19.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, an increase of 24.6% from prior year fourth quarter sales of $15.4 million. This growth is primarily due to an organic increase in sales of service parts, as the installed base of our products continues to grow with the overall growth of the company, as well as the addition of service parts and other revenue from recent acquisition. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 38.7%, representing a 180 basis point increase as compared to 36.9% in the prior year fourth quarter. Gross margin improved over the prior-year quarter due in part to an improved product mix, primarily driven by a higher sales mix of home standby generators and corresponding lower sales mix of portable generators. Also contributing to the improvement in gross margin was a reduction in product cost, due to a moderation commodity cost and continued execution of cost reduction initiatives. These margin improvements were partially offset by the mix impacts in the Ottomotores and Baldor acquisitions. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2013 declined $3.9 million or 6.7% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. As was the case in recent quarters, a large contributor to this reduction was the improved overall warranty rates experienced during the current year quarter, which resulted in a $5.3 million favorable adjustment to warranty reserves, favorably impacting operating margins by approximately 140 basis points. The ongoing impact to the lower overall warranty rates during the current year fourth quarter was approximately $3 million, impacting margins favorably by approximately 75 basis points. In addition, a $2.7 million decline in the amortization of intangibles also contributed to the reduction in operating expenses. Partially offsetting these reductions were operating expenses associated with the acquisitions of Ottomotores, Tower Light and Baldor Generators. Excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during the fourth quarter of 2013 were 12.8%, representing a 160 basis point decline as compared to 14.4% in the prior year quarter. Again, the reversal of warranty reserves due to the improved overall warranty rate experience is the main driver of this decline as a percentage of net sales. Excluding the $5.3 million favorable adjustment and warranty reserves, operating expense as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2013 would have been 14.2%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24.7% to $103.6 million or 27.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to $83.1 million or 24.3% of net sales in the same period last year. This increase in adjusted EBITDA margin is primarily due to the overall improvement in gross profit margin and warranty rate improvements just discussed. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2013 increased 38.9% to a record $402.6 million or 27.1% of net sales as compared to $289.8 million in 2012 or 24.6% of sales. For the full year 2013, adjusted EBITDA margin includes the impact of $17.6 million in adjustments to warranty reserves. Excluding this favorable benefit, EBITDA margin would have been approximately 120 basis points lower, at 25.9%. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $48.5 million as compared to $28.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted net income, as defined in our earnings release increased 27.7% to $77.5 million in the current year quarter versus $60.7 million in the prior year fourth quarter. This increase is attributable to improved operating earnings during the quarter, resulting from a 10% increase in net sales and higher EBITDA margins as well as $4.6 million lower interest expense, due to a reduction in interest rate from the May 2013 refinancing of our senior secured term loans. Offsetting these improvements was a $7.8 million increase in cash income tax expense, as we are starting to become an income tax payer during 2013. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.69 in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconciled in our earnings release was $1.11 for the current year quarter compared to $0.87 per share in the prior year quarter, a 27.6% year-over-year increase. With regards to cash income taxes, the fourth quarter of 2013 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $9.1 million as compared to only $1.3 million in the prior year quarter. And for the full year 2013, was $25.8 million as compared to only $2.8 million during 2012. As we commented during recent conference calls, our cash income taxes for 2013 were expected to increase due to a combination of our NOL carry-forward becoming fully utilized during 2013 and higher overall profitability levels. Accordingly, our cash income tax rate for 2013 was 9.3% as compared to only 1.8% in 2012. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $88.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to $97.4 million in the same period last year. The strong increase in operating earnings compared to the prior year quarter was more than offset by less of a benefit from monetizing working capital compared to the prior year as well as increased levels of capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the full year 2013 was a record $229.2 million. Our uses of cash during 2013, included $31 million for capital expenditures, $116 million for acquisitions and the payment of a $5 per share special dividend in June 2013. As of December 31, 2013, we had a total of $1.2 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount and $150.1 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $1.05 billion. Thanks to our strong free cash flow and earnings growth, we were able to end the year with a consolidated net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.6x, at similar levels when we started the year, despite making the acquisitions of Tower Light and Baldor Generators, and paying a $5 per share special dividend. Given our strong free cash flow profile, we are confident in our ability to continue to invest in the future growth of the business both organically and through M&A, while also evaluating further reductions in leverage levels and opportunities to return capital to shareholders. I would now like to walk through some guidance items to help model-out our cash flows and earnings per share for 2014. In 2014, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $45 million to $47 million, which represents a decline compared to $54.4 million in 2013. The forecast for interest expense includes $40 million to $42 million of cash outflow for debt service cost, plus approximately $5 million for deferred financing cost and original issue discount amortization for our credit facility. This interest expense guidance assumes no additional debt prepayments during fiscal 2014. Our existing interest rate swap contracts remain in place and LIBOR rates to that increase beyond our current LIBOR floor of 75 basis points. Based on our guidance provided for 2014, our cash income taxes for the year is expected to be approximately $63 million to $65 million, which translates into an anticipated full year 2014 cash income tax rate of 21% to 22%. This represents a notable increase as compared to $25.8 million for cash income taxes in 2013 or a 9.3% rate. The projected increase in cash income taxes in 2014 is due to a combination of our NOL carry-forwards and certain tax credit carry-forwards becoming fully utilized during 2013, rather. Less of a benefit from certain discrete tax deductions during 2014 and to a lesser extent higher overall pre-tax profitability levels. It is important to note, however, our favorable tax yield through annual intangible asset amortization in our tax return remains intact through 2021, resulting in approximately $49 million of cash tax savings per year to the next eight years. As a result, our cash income tax rate is expected to be significantly lower than our current projected 36% to 38% GAAP income tax rate for the foreseeable future. As we drive higher profitability over time, cash income taxes can be estimated by applying the projected 36% to38% GAAP income tax rate on pre-tax profits going forward, and then deducting the approximately $49 million of annual cash tax savings from the tax yield each year through 2021. Depreciation expense in 2014 is forecast to be approximately $14 million to $14.5 million. In 2014, our GAAP intangible amortization expense is expected to decline to $21 million to $22 million, as certain of our definite-lived intangible assets become fully amortized. That compensation expense is forecast to be approximately $13 million to $13.5 million. And finally, in 2014, our capital expenditure spending is budgeted to increase modestly to approximately $32 million to $34 million, which is still only approximately 2% of our forecasted net sales for the year. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide additional comments on our outlook for 2014.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Today we are initiating guidance for 2014 with revenues expected to grow over a very strong 2013. For the full year 2014, we expect net sales to increase in the mid-single digit range as compared to the prior year. Importantly, this topline outlook assumes no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment, no major power outage events during 2014 and does not include the potential impact of additional acquisition. The expectation for overall mid-single digit year-over-year growth in 2014, considers the fact that coming into fiscal 2014, residential product lead times were at a normalized level of one to two weeks. Recall that entering 2013, as a result of elevated demand from Superstorm Sandy, lead times for residential products were approximately eight to 10 weeks. In the first quarter of 2013, we effectively executed in ramping production levels to satisfy this increased demand. The reduction in lead times for residential products had an approximate $140 million positive impact on the first half of 2013 sales that is not expected to repeat in the current year. As a result, the prior year first quarter of 2013 produced a record level of revenue. Given that lead times entering the first quarter of this year are trending at more normalized levels, we expect this seasonality of quarterly results during the year to return to a more normal historical pattern, assuming no major power outage events during 2014. As a result, we currently expect the first half of the year to represent approximately 46% of total sales and the second half approximately 54%, with the third quarter being the highest revenue quarter of 2014 and the first the lowest. When taking this into consideration, we expect solid year-over-year revenue growth for every quarter in 2014 with the exception of the first quarter. Although, power outages in various size and severity occur every day across the U.S., thereby driving awareness for standby generators, our guidance assumes no major power outage events. Based on our historical experience, an average major outage could provide incremental net sales of between $20 million and $50 million in the current year, representing the potential for 1% to 3% additional growth to our forecast, depending on several factors. More specifically, the impact of any single major outage event is dependent on the time of the year, the geographic region and the number of people impacted, our existing distribution in the area impacted, the frequency of prior outages in the affected area and the duration of the event. As we have previously noted, we continue to grow Generac both organically and through acquisition over the last several years. Although, our guidance for 2014 does not include any assumptions for additional acquisitions, it's worth noting that we've established our internal business development and integration capabilities over the past three years and currently have an active M&A pipeline. With our strong cash flows and liquidity, we are well-positioned to execute on opportunity to meet our acquisition criteria, should they become actionable. Looking at our guidance by product class. Within our residential products, we expect that shipments of home standby generators in 2014 will be reflective of the new and higher base line level of demand that we believe has been established for these products in recent years. Excluding the impact of the aforementioned production ramp up in the first quarter of 2013 to normalized product lead times, we expect residential product shipments during 2014 to increase between 10% to 12% over the prior year. This growth will be driven by our expanded distribution, continued focus on the optimization of the PowerPlay selling solution, increased investment in a number of other sales and marketing initiatives, increased placement of power washers, and several new product launches throughout the year. With regards to our commercial and industrial products, we expect net sales to increase at a low 20% year-over-year growth rate through a combination of the acquisitions of Tower Light and Baldor Generators as well as a mid-to-high single-digit organic growth rate for both stationery and mobile power equipment. Our 2014 outlook for C&I products is driven by an improving non-residential construction market and strong secular trends with regards to natural gas fuel generators, the building awareness of light commercial optional standby generators and opportunities to further penetrate the wireless telecom backup power market. In addition to these growth drivers, we believe the expansion of our C&I product line, as a result of the Baldor Generators acquisition, will provide us with exciting new opportunities to gain share in the industrial generator market. In summarizing our sales growth assumptions for 2014, excluding the impact of the $140 million headwind related to the first quarter 2013 production ramp up to normalize product lead times, we expect total organic year-over-year growth to be between 9% and 11%. When including this headwind, we expect organic growth to be flat year-over-year in 2014. The acquisitions of Tower Light and Baldor Generators are expected to contribute approximately 5% growth for a total year-over-year net sales increase in the mid-single digit range. As previously mentioned, our guidance does not include any major outage events, which could add another 1% to 3% to our growth, depending on the impact. Consolidated gross margins for 2014 are expected to decline by approximately 100 basis points as compared to the prior year. Reduction is primarily the result of a higher mix anticipated for C&I product shipments, including the impact of the addition of Baldor Generators, partially offset by improved pricing and an overall reduction in product cost within the base business. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding amortization of intangibles are expected to increase approximately 100 basis points as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of the $17.6 million of favorable adjustments to warranty reserves in 2013 that are not expected to repeat in 2014. Excluding this favorable adjustment, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to decline slightly in 2014 relative to 2013. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to remain attractive in the mid-20% range, which is consistent with average level seen during the past four years. Adjusted EBITDA margins during 2014 are expected to increase in some variation as a result of seasonality. The second half of the year is expected to be approximately 400 basis points higher than the first half, as a result of more favorable product mix, increasing synergies from acquisitions and additional SG&A leverage on higher sales volumes. We expect to continue generating significant free cash flow in 2014, given our superior margin profile, capital efficient operating model, low cost of debt and favorable tax attributes. For full year 2014, we expect our conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow to be approximately 90%. In closing this morning, we believe demand for our products will continue to be driven by some compelling long-term growth opportunities. Within residential backup power, the penetration rate of home standby generators remains relatively low at approximately 3%. Addressable U.S. households with several powerful macro trends, expected to further drive awareness of this emerging product category over the long-term. With 70% share of the home standby generator market, as a result of our broad product offering, strong distribution and innovative sales and marketing approach, we believe we are very well-positioned to continue to capture this opportunity. As a reminder, this 1% increase in the penetration rate represents approximately $2 billion of market value. Within the commercial and industrial generator market, we continue to see a secular shift toward more natural gas generators, particularly within the underpenetrated optional standby market. As a leader in natural gas fuel gensets, we are committed to capturing the future growth opportunity. In addition, the growing importance of backup power for critical telecommunications infrastructure has resulted in a significant penetration opportunity with regards to wireless cell towers. As the leading provider of backup generators to this market, we believe we are in an ideal position to capitalize in this secular trend. Finally, through recent acquisitions and new product development, we have significantly expanded our product offering of commercial and industrial generators, more than doubling the addressable market that we and our distribution partners can serve. Our expanded offering of mobile power equipment, positions Generac as one of the world's leading provider of these products. With an extensive product line and a unique national account service model, we expect to benefit from the secular shift towards renting versus buying mobile equipment. In addition, our recent acquisitions provide us access to a growing oil and gas market that will require mobile tower and mobile lighting infrastructure as it continues to build out over the long-term. Finally, we remained focus on geographic expansion by leveraging our Ottomotores and Tower Light acquisitions and driving growth in the markets they serve with additional investment and focus. In addition, we expect to execute on a number of identified revenue and cost synergies across the enterprise. Furthermore, we continue to evaluate other regions of the world for future expansion through both organic growth and potential acquisitions. Powering Ahead remains the foundation for our investments to execute on these opportunities. With a disciplined approach that includes innovation, agility and an intense-focus on the products and markets we serve, we believe we can continue to drive profitable growth for Generac shareholders going forward. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Matt Rybak - Goldman Sachs: It's Matt Ryback on the call for Jerry. Aaron and York, maybe you could just comment a little bit on or update us on the increase you're seeing at the start of the year on the standby side? And I know you mentioned it's going to be a tougher first quarter, whether or not you would expect shipments of the standby to be up sequentially?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think as we laid out, Matt, our guidance indicates, and it's just kind of a important distinction here, when you come off of a year without a major event. We didn't have any major, what we would classify as major events in 2013. As a result, what the business normally looks like, you go to this normal cadence where the first half is generally lower than second half. Q3 is generally the highest quarter and Q1 is the lowest. And the reason for that seasonality is pretty plain. Q1, the winter months are generally the tougher months to install products, so when we look at our activation rates and some of the other leading indicators we watch, those rates approximate where we would think that we would be this time of year. And then Q3, obviously, you get kind of the more normalized summer weather patterns and what not that create more demand at that of the year. So that being said, to answer your question, what we're seeing so far in the year, obviously our guidance didn't include any major event. I would say that at this point, the things that we've seen, the outage events in Pennsylvania last week, about 0.5 million people without power, down south and the southeast here with the ice event here, another 0.5 million without power. I think earlier in the year we had some disturbances in Toronto and in parts of Michigan, but individually those events we wouldn't classify as a major outage event. Certainly they do help us move some portable generator inventory, which I think is important. We're sitting on a lot on a lot of portable generator inventory at the end of the year. Because we didn't get those major events, the retailer channels -- the channel was full, we were full. This is helping us chip away at that. And I think there should be some opportunity to pipe-fill behind that, I think going into the season, the upcoming season, Q2 and Q3 season where portable generators are more prevalent. But with residential standby, I think it's a little too early, usually the tail-on events, whether its the Pennsylvania events or the ice storm down in the southeast, the tail on that is a couple of quarters afterward, so we would expect demand to increase in those areas as a result of the outages, but like we said in our prepared remarks, just 250,000 people everyday in the country without power, so these events, at a 0.5 million people, just they don't really kind of move the needle relative to that.
Matt Rybak - Goldman Sachs: And then to switch gears just a little bit, can you just talk a little bit more about how the Baldor integration is progressing? And maybe detail for us if the distribution structure in the C&I has changed at all after the deal and to what extent you're seeing cross-selling opportunities?
Aaron Jagdfeld: We're really excited about Baldor. We think that it's, for us, anyway it represents kind of a defining moment in our commercial and industrial products portfolio, just the ability to extend that as we've indicated with the addition of those products. And it's certainly, obviously, Baldor came with its own distribution network. Now some of those dealers and distributors look similar to what we have. So there is some overlap. But there is some interesting things that it comes with, we made this comment on our prepared remarks that Baldor has an interesting lead, I would say, in the marketplace on the serving the oil and gas vertical with product. That's not necessarily a channel with stationary equipment that we've served before. We do it with mobile equipment through our Magnum business. But as we look out, and we look at what distribution looks like in the future, we're going through a pretty comprehensive review right now of our distribution for our industrial products, as a result, and really the catalyst here is the Baldor acquisition. I do think that there will be changes that will come out of that. We would expect that. We would expect that we're going to see a higher level of investment by our distribution partners going forward in both sales resources and marketing resources. To go out there now and go for that doubling of the addressable market, that basically we've gotten the ability to serve now with this Baldor acquisition. So really excited about that and excited about the manufacturing footprint increases that they bring us as well. You pointed on something that's really important. The distribution impact to this is going to be a really important part of the integration project that we execute on.
Matt Rybak - Goldman Sachs: And then I'll hop back in queue, last question from me. M&A pipeline was pretty busy in 2013. Just hoping you could maybe touch on what parts of the business you're still looking to round out with additional product offering as we head into '14?
Aaron Jagdfeld: As we said in our comments, we do have a very robust M&A pipeline and it's been robust the last several years. We've done five transactions effectively in last two-and-a-half years and that's coming from a point of not doing a transaction ever before that, so all of our growth, up until that point was organic. But what we found is that, to execute against our strategy, to really accelerate portions of the strategy and the strategic objectives we talked about, gaining share in the industrial market, diversifying product offering, entering new geographies, we found that acquisitions provide us the ability to get there faster. And we're going to continue to be, I think very conservative about acquisitions. And what I mean by that is we're going to be good buyers of company. And we're going to be very diligent in our approach to making sure that acquisitions meet our guidelines. I would tell you that, Matt, looking forward, there's a lot of places in the world where, even though we did the Ottomotores deal, which certainly gave us a footprint down in Latin America. Tower Light, I would call that more of a toehold, if you will in mobile products, really light towers in Europe. We've got the whole rest of the world to look at. So acquisitions worldwide, anything that can give us some global scale are definitely in the pipeline. Also other engine powered equipment. We found the light tower category two-and-a-half years ago with the Magnum acquisition. We believe putting that together with Tower Light, we're now one of the world's largest providers of light towers to the global rental markets. There are other products like that out there and we continue to look at them. You can think of all different types of products that have a diesel or gas engine in them, and they would be fair game frankly, and in particular, if they go through the channels that we've established for Generac, our core businesses and then also through Magnum and Tower Light, where we can leverage our sourcing, where we can leverage our manufacturing capabilities, our technical expertise and our distribution, those are going to be the things we're going to look at going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets.
Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets: I don't know if you mentioned in your prepared remarks, but how much were portables down? And can you talk about kind of on the elevated inventory levels of portables, you talked a little about it, kind of where you were going into the fourth quarter and kind of where you are now, middle of the way, what your expectation is for portables in '14?
Aaron Jagdfeld: In the prepared remarks, we didn't breakdown the home standby and portable, and we just don't give it because it's competitively sensitive. But I think we did indicate, portables are down meaningfully in Q4. As you would expect, I mean we're up against the fourth quarter of prior year, which includes Superstorm Sandy. And certainly I think if you recall, we indicated throughout the year last year in 2013 that the portable, the pipe-fill that occurred after Superstorm Sandy was relatively strong going into '13, so Q1, Q2. So inventories were very lean last year. So year-over-year, when you compare portable inventory positions at the end of the year, how we see, as I mentioned before, we were high and channel was high or channels falls, we'll fall. We have been chipping away at it. The kind of the cadence we look at there, as we come into a year, and we plan for basically the amount of shelf space that we have at retail to turn products through on an everyday basis, should we not get a major event. So the thesis is, we go into kind of the Q2 -- going into Q3, going at Q3 being the peak and we plan for inventory levels that we want to make sure, we have enough inventory on hand to satisfying any large events that could happen. Should they not happen, we want to be a sell that inventory down on an everyday basis over the next two to three, maybe four quarters at the longest. I would tell you that we're on the path to doing that. Again, without getting too discrete into the numbers, we've made a nice little dent in the portable business. We haven't gotten the full picture yet of January's retail numbers where inventories were at for some of our retail partners, but some of the numbers we have seen indicate that they also begin to flush inventory in parts of the country, where we had events. So we feel good that there maybe some restocking opportunities in those areas. We do have a couple of winds that we picked up, some additional shelf space this year in 2014, that will expand our shelf a little bit with portable generators, but we've got a nice kind of mid-20% share of that market, right now, and kind of, continue to grow a little bit more here into 2014. And we really think that we're largest portable generator provider here in the U.S. today.
Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets: And switching gears on the telecom market. What are you hearing from the major telecom companies in terms of what their CapEx spending looks like on the generator side into 2014 and how that play out in Q4?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Q4 was a good quarter for us with telecom, as we indicated. I think some of the telecom's may have been a little more conservative with CapEx earlier in the year and a little less conservative within the second half, and that's a more normal telecom, when we look at our customers in that channel. They tend to come out of the year maybe a little bit conservative, kind of wait and see approach, and how the year is going to play out. And then maybe do a little bit of budget going towards the end of the year and we think that played out last year. As we come into '14, I wish that they gave us really discrete guidance of what they were going to spend on generators. We get some indication of CapEx numbers in totality for new site build and retrofit. But they don't unfortunately give us what that equates to in their minds in generators. So in some cases there are third-party project managers, in between the telecom provider and ourselves, and in some cases we're helping project manage along the way. We think that again, this a market that has a tremendous amount of upside potential. As we've said, our estimates are -- and the wireless industry estimates are, that they're about 300,000 wireless towers sites in the U.S. About 30% of those sites today have some kind of backup power, the other 70% do not. More and more critical communications, wireless, voice and data are going across these networks and the hardening of these networks is something that is definitely on the minds of the providers, and if not the regulators as well. So this is going to be a secular trend for us. It's going to take a number of years to continue that to build out. And we expect that in '14 and beyond that that's going to be an important vertical for us and continue to be an important vertical for us. And we lead that vertical from a share perspective, and really have for almost two decades, and that's a really important channel for us.
Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets: And one more, I'll hop back in the queue. Can you just talk about, you had a more focused effort on the C&I market, going after like C stores and gas stations and things like that. Can you talk about kind of what kind of traction you've seen since you become a bit more focused on that space?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. We've got an internal initiative that we kicked-off last year. Again, on the heels of some of the major awareness events that have happened in the last several years. And we just felt and we have felt for a long time that there is a very compelling ROI for many small footprint retail businesses, as we refer to them and/or sometimes that we also call the optional standby market. So where a standby generator is not required by code or regulation, it's a business decision, a business investment decision to purchase such a product. And the protection of revenue stream, the protection of perishable inventories, the continuity of business, all of those things weigh into that decision. Certainly there are verticals within the small footprint retail or light commercial space, where the ROI is very compelling. You get into small restaurants, convenient stores, gas stations and the like and the ROI is off the chart. I mean you can literally pay for a natural gas fired, small light commercial genset in a single outage of 24 hours or less. So there is, in some of those applications, it's just no-brainer, it's just a question of building awareness. So it feels a lot like where we were at 10 years ago with the residential category, right. We had a lot of kind of missionary work to do in the front-end of this to educate. And so we put in place a number of things. We've got a website that we put up last year called, poweryoucontrol or [ph] powerforyourbusiness.com, it helps people kind of get just some simple ideas on the return on investment and just some of the industry verticals that we've identified here. We're going to continue to expand on that to create a richer pipeline of sales leads off of that and as well as often some other marketing efforts that we've got. One of the things that we found maybe we fell into it or maybe it was really good planning, but we talked about this AMP marketing data that we have, the confluence of our activation data for home standby generators, outage data, and then third-party homeowner demographic data, that's really turned out to be a very important data set for us to use for small businesses, because as you would imagine most of the small businesses that we're talking about in small footprint retail are clustered around where homeowners live. So it really is kind of giving us, its shining a light for us on the path of where we need to go to do the marketing. So we're able to use that AMP marketing data and exploit that for this light commercial segment in a way that I don't think we had anticipated early on. So all those things are good things, but they're going to take time. I mean there is some missionary work to be had here, but we like the penetration opportunity. We think there is about 6 million businesses or buildings out there that could benefit from a backup generator and there's, optional standby category, and we think that being a natural gas leader in the industry, we should dominate that in a way that we've dominated the residential space.
Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets: I'm going to speak one more here. Can you just talk about the opportunity at some point with homebuilders, new homebuilding coming and adding a standby generator as an option when you're building a new house? Any ideas, any plans to maybe partner up with the homebuilder to become sort of the preferred supplier for that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. We talked about new constructions where you want to install a standby. I mean you have all the trades on-site, you've got all the permits pulled, all the walls are open, it's much easier, that the installation cost is a fraction on a home standby generator in new construction versus a retrofit. Again, more than 90% of what we do is retrofit, only 10% is new construction. We have tried for a number of years with some degrees of success to penetrate that new construction marketplace. Obviously that became very challenging at the depths of the housing crises in '08 and '09. That was a really tough conversation to have with a builder when they were really just trying to keep their heads above water. Today, though, I think we're reaching a point, an inflection point in the demand for these types of products. Really that's related to the improved awareness of them. It was really hard to have a conversation with builders about the category when customers weren't asking for it. They weren't asking for because they didn't know about it. So it was this vicious cycle that was difficult to break. Where we're getting traction is with the custom homebuilders. The custom builders understand that they need to differentiate their product, if you will, from the large production builders and the track builders, tracked homebuilders. So that's something where we're seeing some important traction there. We've got a sales team put together for that. We have a number of initiatives to target that directly. We were just at the International Builder Show last week. A show we've been at for the last five years displaying products. So that's been an important part of building awareness within the build, the new construction community, and with the people, the trades that are involved with that community. And that's been a really important part of that strategy and will be going forward. I still think it's going to be something that at some point, builders are going to offer this as a standard option on certain dwellings. And I think it's just going to be -- the argument is too compelling when you look at the macro pieces that we have talked about with the aging grid and the aging demographics in this country. Having a backup generator in home just makes far too much sense and it's a really important thing for a lot of people going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord: It's Chip Moore for John. Just following up on that last one. On new housing starts, we're back to a 1 million here in the U.S., give or take. How much is that alone helping you guys do you think?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Well, couple of things there. So penetration rates for new construction are about double what they are for the penetration rates of existing homes. So if we say that the existing, the all-in rate is 3%, new construction penetration rates are probably somewhere in that maybe 4% to 6%. Again, you have to do the math. The challenge there, the increase from 0.5 million homes to 1 million homes, not all of those are homes that would typically take a generator. So you have to strip out some of the stuff that we wouldn't think would be, some of the lesser value homes or maybe some of the certainly, multifamily homes, which I don't think you're including, Chip, in your number of a 1 million. But if you look at just that penetration rate being a little bit higher there, and our 70% share, which we think is fairly consistent in that marketplace, it's had an impact. And obviously going from a 500,000 to 1 million, it's had an impact, and we'll continue it on a go-forward basis. What we have to do is increase that penetration rate because it just makes so much more sense to have that product there. Again, it's such a compelling value relative to a retrofit when it comes to the installation cost. It's just a fraction of the cost.
Chip Moore - Canaccord: And as the follow-up, maybe little more color on some of the marketing initiatives, where do you stand on PowerPlay option. How does that translates into closure rates?
Aaron Jagdfeld: So PowerPlay, we talked about this, we had some targets last year that I think we gave you guys, we wanted to have over 1,000 users on PowerPlay. We hit that number. We're very happy with our achievement there. There is a good percentage of sales running through PowerPlay today. And we see a marked difference between dealers that are using the PowerPlay selling solution versus dealers that don't in terms of increases in sales year-over-year. And we strip out storm affected areas versus non-storm affected areas. We do that analysis to understand kind of the underlying impact of PowerPlay. Close rates continue to -- I am impressed with our close rates when we use PowerPlay. I think they could be better, though, and we have a lot of initiatives in 2014 here around improving close rates with the PowerPlay users. So a couple of things that we're working on; one, we're expanding very dramatically our training of PowerPlay users as it relates to, what we call IHC university. IHC is our in-home consultation. The residential standby category, the home standby category is really, it's an in-home selling proposition. It's a kitchen table pitch, as what we refer to it as. And so it's a contractor, which is our dealer, sitting across the table from a family and running through all the things that go into that decision process. Contractors and our dealers, we have some guys in there that are really good sales people, but by and large, contractors are, I would say, they are awesome trades people and they are very good technical people with what they do, but maybe selling is not chief among the skill sets that you'd put up at the top. So training them properly and giving them the tools to win is really what we're focused on here in 2014. The other thing we're going to do is continue to increase our spending on our infomercial. That infomercial was we think very successful last year for us. We really like the results. We liked what we see. It's the first time we had ever done something like that. That's something that we're going to continue to play that out and push on that even harder this year as we continue to look at that. And we've also got some new programs for dealers that we think can help them win as well and improve that close rate. We've got a new consumer financing program that we've launched here with GE that was going to be pretty meaningful and will be fully integrated into the PowerPlay solution. So a basically a dealer will be able to sit at a kitchen table or at a homeowners residence and go through that pitch, and really offer them the financing package right away, because obviously coming up with the out-of-pocket funds for a product like this is generally where the close rates kind of breaks down, right. And improving close rate, access to capital for the homeowner is an important of that. So we're focused on that as well. And also educating homeowners on installation cost and continuing to work on bringing the installation cost down, that's another factor here. We've got to continue to bring the affordability of these products, we've got to continue to improve that and continue to make them more accessible and that's something we've been doing for over 10 years. But I think there is still room to be had on that installation site to make that even more attractive, so the total kind of turnkey cost to a homeowner is that much more compelling.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel: Quick question for you. On the EBITDA margins, did you say that there would be going to be 400 basis points higher in the back half of the year or in the first half of year, or did I miss hear that?
York Ragen: What we said was 400 basis points difference second half versus first half, so we're talking mid-20s for the year and be about a 400 basis point difference in second half versus first half. And I think that's just sort of theme that --from a seasonality perspective, we talked about normal seasonality patterns that we're expecting in 2014, we haven't seen normal seasonality patterns for last couple of years. So I think we have to educate investors and calibrate in terms of how the seasonality we're expecting, in terms of not only topline, and not only margins, and not only cash flows, how to play out from a seasonality perspective. But in general, as we talked about, revenues will be higher in the second half versus first half, margins will be higher in the second half versus the first half, cash flows will be higher in the second half versus the first half. And probably, when you think about the first half, you would think those categories would build from Q1 into Q2. So I think that's how we're thinking about trends there from a seasonality perspective.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel: And then, on the Mobile Link, could you give us a feel for how large the installed base is relative to the number of home standby units you had out there? And is this a year where you're going to look to try to monetize some of the installed base?
Aaron Jagdfeld: One of our prepared remarks, and we had a pretty significant milestone that we had this year. We built and sold our 1 million home standby generators. So in terms of our installed base, there are 1 million Generac home standby generators out there, which I think that that's really cool and only be 3% penetrated, and the kind of opportunity we have ahead of us is remarkable. But aside from that, the Mobile Link is retroactive, it works retroactively with products from our 2008 product line forward. So there is a good chunk of that million units that would be in that sweet spot of available monetization if you will for Mobile Link. And so we've started actively marketing the Mobile Link solution. And it's kind of unique for us, because we don't sell in product direct to the consumer. And so this is really a change in business model in terms of both selling a service and then selling it direct. And it's a subscription-based service. I was really blown away by the uptake on that in the first year of it, it exceeded our expectations, because I think it is such a compelling thing. Actually, we're rolling out android and Apple app-based platform for that here and it will be at the end of this month in February. So that you can pull it up on your app, you can see your generator, it will send you the maintenance alerts, text alerts for service. You can include your dealer in that loop for service. We think that the revenue model going forward could be refined and matured to have different levels of service pricing and plan. So I'm really excited about it, because we've never really kind of drilled in on the monetization. We have aftermarket parts, of course, that we sell for these products, but it's pretty limited. It's really not been an area of focus for us. Our focus has been on creating the awareness for the category and creating kind of the category in general. So monetizing this is going to be kind of fun to see how that develops over time. And it will be small at first, but there is obviously a big base to work from.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
James Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets: This is James Picariello in for Jeff. Can you just hit on how you're thinking about capital allocation? I mean it is safe to assume that a special dividend is off the table with private equity now to the fixture, is there any color there?
York Ragen: Yes, and we've talked a lot about uses of cash, since we've been public and we've been pretty consistent on how we've demonstrated our uses of cash. First and foremost, we want to grow organically and we want to pay down leverage and we've reduced our leverage over time. We are down to 2.6x net debt leverage here at the end of the year, which is well within our range here that we've talked about from a targeted leverage standpoint. We wanted to do bolt-on M&A like we have been doing over the last few years. And then, once you step to those priorities, the board will consider returning capital shareholders, in last couple of years we've done that. I think when you look forward I don't think the priorities are much different than that. We want to grow organically, we want to get into our targeted leverage range of 2x to 3x, and want to continue to do M&A like Aaron talked about from an M&A pipeline standpoint, and we have opportunities there. But once we step to those priorities, again, then the board at that time will consider all the different alternatives that maybe out there, be it a regular dividend, be it share buyback, be it special dividend, each option will be evaluated at that time, when we step to the priorities.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I just want to follow-up on that question. So your willingness to pay another special dividend, is that largely a function of availability of attractive acquisitions over the next six months, in terms of whether or not you have the excess cash, because as you said, you're already within your targeted leverage range?
York Ragen: Like I said, we want to step through our priorities. We have three other priorities, before the board will start evaluating returning capital to shareholders. So we're operating to that plan, and once we step to that plan and evaluate what opportunities look to your point, Ross, on the M&A pipeline. It's a broader, probably, view than just six months, in terms of how we view that. I mean it's like Aaron talked about, we have a broad pipeline from M&A standpoint. And as things become actionable, we want to be able to act on them. And we'll evaluate it throughout the year, but we want to step to the first three priorities for us there, Ross.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.
Brian Drab - William Blair: Most topics have been touched on at this point, impart just because you guys are so comprehensive. But Aaron you speak so quickly and comprehensively that there is so much information in these calls. So international is still very small percentage of revenue. Can you just touch on roughly, what percentage of revenue is international in 2013? When will international be more meaningful, I don't if it's 5% or 10%. Do you have an idea in mind, when you reach that percentage or level of revenue international?
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's interesting, Brian. If you go back two years ago, our sales outside the U.S. and Canada were less than 1%. Today, when you pro forma for the acquisitions, you can pro forma those acquisitions in between '13, you get about 12%. And obviously, that's good growth internationally and that's not a much bigger base by the way of total sales. So those are starting to become important pieces of our business. We've got a long way to go. We're going to globalize this business. As I said in the prepared remarks and in some of the Q&A here, I think it's an $18 billion market worldwide for power generation. And then you get into some of the other power equipment things like towers and other engine powered things that we've talked about, that's even greater. Our opportunity I think is really pretty tremendous. We've got to execute, obviously, and doing acquisitions domestically is one thing, doing them internationally is another. And our Ottomotores acquisition that we did in December of 2012, that 2013 we did a lot of work on that acquisition to integrate it in. And we've learned a lot in terms of operating, manufacturing outside the U.S. But when you think of the world, and the way I think of it, if you look at Latin America, I think we've got a great platform there with Ottomotores to go after Latin American markets. So I think for the Americas, we feel pretty good about where we sit, at least in terms of power generation. When you look at the rest of the world though, we really don't have any presence in Europe, Middle East or Africa, when it comes to stationery gensets. We deal with mobile products with Tower Light, but stationery gensets are completely different end-market and different product. And then you get into China, you get into India, some closed markets like that, even Brazil I would consider to be a closed market. And there is opportunities within those areas of the world, where I think as we look at building out the company globally, those are areas that we need to either find acquisitions or find our way organically. And that's our focus going forward here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just had one follow-up. So on the C&I side of the business, York, can you just repeat what the guidance was? I think it was, was it up 20?
York Ragen: Yes. So we talked about, for 2014 it would be up low-20s and organically it would be in that mid-to-high single-digit range.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And you would explain that in terms of visibility from telecom, it's a bit limited right now, clearly there is a very long runway and a lot of penetration opportunity. But what kind of visibility you really have on organic growth, because clearly you've got very, very difficult comparatives on the C&I side of the business as well as is it what you're seeing out of the rental market or just in some of these new rent markets that gives you confidence to forecast organic growth at this point?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think there is a couple of thing. I mean one of the leading indictors there is non-resi construction, which is I think an important -- there seems to be some life in some of those indicators. So that gives us hope that as it relates to some of the areas, in particular retail and some of these areas where we're actually focusing even more on with the optional standby market that we like what that looks like. The rental market, there is a secular shift, as we've talked about, to renting equipment versus buying it. It's very prevalent here in the Americas and certainly in the U.S. We're starting to see that pickup in places of the world like Europe, where maybe buying equipment was the first choice as opposed to renting. But all it takes is a good economic price as to I think get people to align around the idea of renting versus buying, better matching their expenses with their revenues, and renting certainly allows them to that. And that's a mindset shift for places like Europe, where the traditional solution has just been for a contract or a company to go out and buy a piece of equipment. And that's one of the reason we really like Tower Light, is that they have excellent relationships there. The other one that I would call out, the recovery in the oil and gas and domestic energy production is another secular trend here. If you believe anything about the U.S., you believe that the next couple of decades are going to be really important in terms of domestic energy production. And what that allows for us to do is and really this is all through acquisitions, through Magnum couple of years ago and then here through Baldor, we've got a nice product portfolio and some nice relationships with from a distribution standpoint to serve that vertical. And that would not be a position we would have been in a couple of year ago. And obviously that pulled back a little bit over last year-and-a-half, and now we've seen signs where given the increase in natural gas prices and I think just the overall demand for nat gas going forward, as it becomes a more widely used fuel, if we can get it into in terms of the transportation fuel, I mean certainly that could create just an amazing amount of opportunity for domestic energy production. But we really like that vertical. We like the recovery in that here. And we like that we're kind of building a nice niche around that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
James Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Just a quick follow-up here. Regarding your yearend dealer number of 5,400, if I heard correctly, the net add was 550 dealers. Can you just quantify what the total attrition was?
Aaron Jagdfeld: We don't breakout the attrition. I mean we do have churns in that, and we had about every year, and this is the interesting thing about the dealer base. These are small contractors, small businesses, and small businesses are formed and dissolved very quickly. So in fact, the lifespan of a small business in the contracting space is about seven years. So theoretically, we've moved about 15%, a little more than 15% of our distribution base every year, just to attrition businesses that go out of business, people who sell their business, owners who retire or die, whatever the case may be, however they get out of business. And then there a lot of businesses that get formed. So we have a constant pipeline of that. But we have some pretty stringent requirements going into become a dealer that every year that's going by. We've continued to increase the amount of requirements to becoming a dealer. And we're a lot more targeted in where we add them. We're really focused on adding dealers, where we feel penetration rates are low. We don't want to put a new dealer in a good dealer's backyard, that doesn't do anybody any good from an investment standpoint. But what we do want to do is find a new dealer or a new contractor and put them in a market where we're underrepresented or we feel there is opportunity. And so that's really our focus going forward and has been for a long time. That rate of 550 net adds was over kind of our historical rate of 300 to 400 net adds on an annual basis. We think 2014 will revert back to kind of that 300 to 400 cadence again going forward.
Operator: And this concludes the Q&A session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Aaron Jagdfeld for any closing remarks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you. We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. And we look forward to our first quarter 2014 earnings release, which we anticipate will be sometime in early May. Thanks again for your time. Good bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Q3 2013 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mark, and I’ll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.
York Ragen: Thank you. Good morning. And welcome to our third quarter 2013 earnings call. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we’ll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today’s call. Additional information regarding these measures including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I’ll now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter 2013 results continue to demonstrate the numerous secular growth drivers for our business, as well as the ongoing execution of our Powering Ahead strategic plan. Third quarter net sales increased 21% over the prior year to $363 million, as we once again -- experience double-digit organic growth lead by strong shipments of commercial and industrial products, as well as home standby generators. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share increased 31% and 36%, respectively in the quarter, with EBITDA margins increasing 210 basis points over the prior year, primarily as a result of ongoing improvements in warranty rates. Growth in shipments of home standby generators was again strong as the market adoption for these products continues to grow as a result of a combination of factors highlighted by the overall additional awareness created from power -- major power outages in recent years, additional distribution and increased sales and marketing efforts. Our residential dealer base further expanded as we ended the third quarter with over 5,200 dealers. We continue to add dealers at a pace above historical rates with over 400 net dealers added thus far in 2013 and nearly a 1,000 net dealer add since the end of 2011. Further adding to the growth in home standby generators is our progress on a number of recently launched sales and marketing initiatives highlighted by our amp targeted marketing process, the PowerPlay in-home selling solution, as well as our Power You Control national advertising campaign. We believe these factors including a more favorable environment for residential investment are driving a new and higher baseline level of demand for home standby generators. With penetration rates of home standby generators at only approximately 3% of single-family unattached homes in the U.S., we continue to believe there remains a substantial opportunity for Generac to further grow the market for this emerging product category. Amp, PowerPlay and the national advertising campaign were fully launched in early 2013 and remain an important corporate focus, as these key initiatives are targeted to further extend the awareness of home standby generators in the quarters ahead. The number of dealers using PowerPlay continued to grow during the third quarter and we are on target to achieving an approximately 20% adoption rate by our dealer base by the end of 2013. We remained encouraged by the role out of PowerPlay thus far as we continue to see a notable improvement in our sales closure rates for dealers using this new and innovative sales tool. In addition, our Power You Control direct response television advertising which launched at the end of May is expanding awareness and generating sales leads for the product category at an attractive cost relative to other forms of direct marketing. Shipments of portable generators declined during the third quarter of 2013 due to less severe power outages relative to the third quarter of 2012 which saw significant demand from the derecho windstorm event that impacted the mid-west and the mid-Atlantic regions and to a lesser extent Hurricane Isaac which impacted portions of the Gulf Coast region. Despite the decline in portable generators during the current year quarter, year-to-date 2013 shipments of these products have been much stronger relative to our initial expectations entering the year. As commented on during the last quarter, we were encouraged by the robust demand for portable generators during the first half of 2013 following superstorm Sandy. Combined with our broad relationships at retail, this has provided us with expanded placement for portable generators and as a result, we believe we continue to experience increased market share gains in this product category compared to the prior year. Our ongoing success in portable generators has further solidified our leading position in providing a full range of backup power products for the residential market and has positioned Generac as being the household name in backup power. Sales of commercial and industrial products increased at a strong double-digit organic growth rate during the third quarter as increased awareness of the need for backup power on the part of businesses positively impacted results. The strong momentum that we experienced during the first half of 2013 from our telecom national account customers continued during the third quarter as wireless providers in particular look to further safeguard their networks from future outages. Additionally, we continue to see attractive revenue growth from shipments of light commercial generators used in smaller footprint retail applications as market interest in cleaner burning, more cost-effective natural gas fuel back-up generators continues to increase as a result of the exceptional value proposition of these products. Also contributing to our strong revenue growth in C&I products during the third quarter with the acquisitions of Ottomotores, which closed in December 2012 and Tower Light which closed in August 2013. We continue to remain active on the acquisition front by announcing earlier this month the agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of the generator division of Baldor Electric Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ABB Group. Baldor generators offers a complete line of standby and prime rated products ranging from 3 kilowatts to 2.5 megawatts throughout the U.S. and Canada. The addition of these products significantly expands our industrial product offering and essentially doubles the addressable domestic market that Generac and its distribution partners can serve. Acquiring the higher power product line from Baldor generators accelerates our organic efforts to increase our share of the commercial and industrial power generation market, while also adding a 255,000-square foot purpose built facility that provides significant production and testing capacity for future growth. The integration of Baldor generators will be a key cooperate focus throughout 2014 and we’re excited about the opportunity to execute on the potential revenue synergies by further strengthening the combined distribution of the company. Additionally, although, early in the process, we believe there are meaningful cost synergies to begin given our lean product cost structure and increased manufacturing and sourcing scales as we transition the acquired products and facility into the Generac portfolio. With regards to our EBITDA margin improvements, I want to take a few moments to comment on some very positive trends that we continue to see with declining warranty rates for our products. We spoke briefly last quarter about warranty rate improvements being a key driver favorably impacting our adjusted EBITDA margin over the prior year and the momentum on this front continued into the third quarter. Over the last five years our teams have delivered on numerous design and manufacturing improvements in an efforts to further enhance product reliability and the ownership experience to give our customers the piece of mind that they expect when they buy a Generac generator to protect their home or business. The reduction in warranty rates in the current year is evidence these longer-term efforts are having a positive impact on both customer stratification and the profitability of the company. Our Powering Ahead strategic plan is focused on driving baseline growth and we have been successfully executing on this strategy over the past three years by remaining focus on four key growth objectives. Growing the residential market, gaining commercial and industrial market share, diversifying our end markets and finally, expanding into new geographies. When you combine our Powering Ahead strategy with the long-term growth drivers for our business and the potential for further recovery in residential investments and non-residential construction we believe Generac is well-positioned over the long-term to drive future growth and shareholder value. I’d now like to turn the call back over to York to discuss third quarter results in more detail. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the third quarter 2013 were $363.3 million, a 20.9% increase, as compared to $300.6 million in the third quarter of 2012. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales increased -- increased to $192.7 million in the third quarter of 2013, as compared to a strong prior year net sales comparison of $191 million. During the third quarter, Generac continue to experience solid growth in shipments of home standby generators in comparison the prior year, as well as continued growth on a sequential quarter-over-quarter bases. The continued strength in home standby shipment is due to a combination of factors, including the additional awareness credited by major power outages in recent year driving the further adoption of the category and expanded distribution broadening the availability of the product. Other drives of home standby growth are increased sales and marketing initiatives to create and close lease more effectively, overall strong operational execution to satisfy the increased demand and a more favorable environment for residential investment. The strength in home standby generators was partially offset by a decline in shipments of portable generators due to less severe power outages events in the current year quarter relative to the prior year. Recall that prior year third quarter had a number of major outages during the quarter which did not repeat. Also contributing to the revenue growth for residential products during the third quarter 2013 was our growing presence in the market for engine driven power washers. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales increased 61.8% to $151.5 million in the third quarter of 2013, from $93.6 million in the third quarter of 2012. The increase in C&I net sales was primarily driven by a very strong organic increase and shipments to certain national account customers, in particular certain customers in the telecom and rental verticals. As wireless telecom providers continue to harden their networks and as certain national rental companies update their mobile power equipment fleets, we have seen robust growth during the current year quarter. As commented on in previous quarters, there can be some variability in our C&I product shipments from quarter-to-quarter, primarily due to timing of capital spending by these national account customers. In addition to growth from our national account customers, we also saw growth coming from natural gas standby generators using light commercial applications, as our commercial teams have been focused on penetrating the significant opportunity. Supplementing our organic growth, the Ottomotores acquisition which closed in December 2012 and the Tower Light acquisition which closed in August 2013 contributed to year-over-year growth in C&I products as well. Our other product sales category improved $19.1 million in the third quarter of 2013, an increase of 19% from prior year third quarter sales of $16 million. This growth was primarily due to increased sales of service parts of the installed base of our product continues to grow with the overall growth of the company. Gross margin for the third quarter was 38.4%, which was approximately flat as compared to 38.5% in the prior year quarter. Gross margin during the current year quarter reflects the mix impact from the addition of Ottomotores sales, along with a higher mix of organic C&I products. This was mostly offset by the positive impact from a moderation and commodity cost, and continued execution of cost reduction initiatives across the company. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2013 declined $4.5 million or 8% as compared to the third quarter of 2012. A large contributor to this reduction was the improved overall warranty rates experienced during the current year quarter, which resulted in a $5.6 million favorable adjustment to warranty reserves, impacting margins by approximately 150 basis points. A decline in the amortization of intangibles also contributed to the reduction in operating expenses. Partially offsetting these reductions were operating expenses associated with the Ottomotores and Tower Light businesses, as well as increases in sales, engineering and administrative infrastructure to support the strategic growth initiatives and higher baseline sales levels of the company. Excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during the third quarter of 2013 were 12.4%, representing a 230 basis point decline as compared to 14.7% in the prior year quarter. Again, the lower warranty expense was the main driver of this 230 basis point improvement, which includes the reversal of warranty reserves combined with lower overall baseline warranty rates. Excluding the $5.6 million favorable adjustments in warranty reserves, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter would have been 14%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 31.2% to $101 million or 27.5% of net sales in the third quarter of 2013 as compare to $76.3 million or 25.4% of net sales in the same period last year. This increase in adjusted EBITDA margin is predominantly related to the warranty rate improvement just discussed. Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months as of September 30, 2013 was $382.1 million or 26.3% of net sales during that period. GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2013 was $47.1 million, as compare to $25.5 million for the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted net income as defined in our earning release increased 36.2% to $73.7 million in the current year quarter versus $54.1 million in the prior year third quarter. This increase is attributable to improved operating earnings during this quarter resulting from a 20.9% increase in net sales and higher EBITDA margins, as well as $4.4 million in lower interest expense due to a reduction in interest rate from the May 2013 refinancing of our senior secured term loans. Offsetting these improvements was an $8.4 million increase in cash income tax expense. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.67 in the third quarter of 2013 compare to $0.37 per share in the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconcile in our earning release was a $1.06 for the current year quarter, compared to $0.78 per share in the prior year quarter, a 35.9% year-over-year increase. With regard to cash income taxes, third quarter of 2013 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $9.5 million, as compare to only $1.2 million in the prior year quarter. As we commented during recent conference calls, our cash income taxes for 2013 are expected to increase going forward due to combination of our NOL carryforward becoming fully utilized during 2013 and higher overall profitability levels. Cash income taxes for 2013 were previously estimated to be approximately $15.5 million to $16.5 million, based on our increase in guidance for full year 2013 cash income tax expense is now projected to be $23 million to $24 million for the year, which translates into an anticipated full year 2013 cash income tax rate of 8.5% to 9.5%. However, you should remember our favorable tax yield through annual intangible assets amortization in our tax return remains intact through 2021, resulting in approximately $49 million of cash tax savings per year for the next nine years. As a result, our cash income tax rate is expect to be significantly lower than our current projected 36% to 38% GAAP income tax rate for the foreseeable future. As we drive higher profitability overtime, cash income taxes can be estimated by applying the projected 36% to 38% tax rates on a -- on pre-tax profits going forward and then deducting the approximately $49 million of annual cash tax saving each year through 2021. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $76.7 million in the third quarter of 2013, as compared to $61.6 million in the same period last year. The increase in free cash flow was primarily the result of strong operating earnings and lower capital spending levels compared to the prior year quarter, partially offset by a modest overall increase in working capital investment as we are able to monetize seasonal inventory levels during the prior year quarter. Free cash flow over the past 12 months was $238.4 million. As of September 30, 2013, we had a total of $1.21 billion of outstanding debt, net of unamortized original issue discount and $116.5 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in a consolidated net debt of $1.09 billion. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was $2.9 times, compared to $3.1 times ratio at September 30, 2012. Given our strong free cash flow profile, we are confident in our ability to continue to invest in the future growth of the business both organically and through M&A while also reducing leverage levels over time. With that, I’d now like to turn the call back to Aaron to provide additional comments on our outlook for the remainder of 2013.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. As a result of the continued strong demand for our home standby generators, as well as a modest impact from the expected closing of the Baldor Generators acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2013, we are once again raising our sales guidance. Full year net sales are now expected to increase in the low to mid 20% range over the prior year, which is an increase from the low 20% range previously expected. This guidance continues to assume no major power outage events for the remainder of the year. As we have discussed, demand for home standby generators continues to benefit from additional awareness and adoption created from the major power outage events in recent years, our expanded distribution, the execution of our current sales and marketing initiatives and a more favorable environment for residential investment. This has driven adoption rates for home standby generators even further than previously expected. As a result, total residential products sales are now expected to increase at a mid to high teens rate for the full year 2013 over the prior year, which compares to the high single-digit growth rate previously expected. As discussed, our guidance for the remainder of the year does not include any assumptions for major power outage events. However, the prior year fourth quarter included superstorm Sandy. As a result of this strong prior year comparison, we expect the fourth quarter of 2013 to show a continued decline in shipments of portable generators year-over-year. However, we expect shipments of home standby generators will increase during the fourth quarter will be further demonstrates the continued adoption of this emerging product category. Net sales for commercial and industrial products are expected to be in line with the previous guidance of increasing in the low 40% range. Summarizing our sales growth assumptions for full year 2013, total company organic year-over-year growth is now expected to be between 14% to 16%, which represents an increase from our previous guidance of between 11% to 13%. Acquisitions are expected to contribute between 8% to 9% growth for total expected year-over-year net sales increase in the low to mid 20% range. Consolidated gross margins for 2013 are now expected to increase by approximately 50 basis points as compared to the prior year which represents an improvement from the previous expectation of approximately flat. The expected improvement in gross margin is due to a more favorable mix of residential home standby products. As a result of this increased outlook, we expect full year gross margin of approximately 38%, representing nearly 100 basis point improvement relative to two years ago, while continuing to diversify and globalize our business during this time. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding amortization of intangibles are now expected to decline by approximately 75 to 100 basis points as compared to 2012, which is an improvement from the previous expectation of approximately flat. This updated outlook is driven primarily by the previously discussed improvement in our warranty rates and to a lesser extent increased operating leverage on higher sales volumes versus previous expectation. As a result of higher sales outlook and improved margin guidance, we now expect adjusted EBITDA for full year 2013 to increase in the low 30% range, which is an increase from the low 20% range previously expected. In closing, this morning we believe the continued under investment in the electrical grid and aging population and increased reliance on uninterrupted power and data and more severe and unpredictable weather will drive strong demand for our residential, commercial and industrial backup generators well into the future. In particular, given the relatively low penetration for both home and light commercial standby generators, we believe there is a substantial opportunity for long-term growth as the leader in these emerging product categories. In addition, we remained very positive about the significant opportunity to provide backup power for critical commercial infrastructure, the overall ongoing secular ships in the market for natural gas generators and the rental of mobile power equipment. These growth drivers are also supplemented by a consensus expectation of an improving macroeconomic environment, heading into 2014 with certain indicators such as single family housing starts, new single family home sales and non-residential construction are expected to demonstrate some level of improvement. Additionally, we have been focused on better balancing the overall products that we offer in geographies that we serve. Much of this diversification has been achieved over the past couple of years through our strategic acquisitions of Magnum Products, Ottomotores, Tower Light and the pending closing of Baldor Generators. These acquisitions are an integral part of our powering ahead strategic plan and have allowed us to accelerate the diversification and international expansion of our business. This concludes our prepared remarks and at this time, we’d like to open up the call for questions. Operator? 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Charlie Brady from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets: Good morning, guys. How are you? Just touch on the warranty reserve reversal that was the one-off type of thing in this quarter. Obviously the warranty rates going down, but as far as the sharp reversal and the rate, the 6.7 rate that’s kind of a one-off for Q3, right, the rate on the percentage basis.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Because the $5.6 million that we referred to in the prepared remarks was really what, I guess what you say as sort of the one-offs, maybe non-run rateable reversal of the warranty reserves. So that’s where I think we try to recalibrate on a normalize basis, backing that out about 1.5% impact on margin.
Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. But going forward your overall, I mean, there is some positive impact on a go-forward longer term rates, because your rates have come down on a longer-term run rate, correct?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. I think you can see that, because margins -- operating expense improved about 230 basis points and that impact of that reserve reversal was about 150 basis points, so we improved rate going forward.
Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets:  Okay. On the portal, can you quantify how much portables were down in the quarter and kind of -- I mean you talked about market share gains, can you put any kind of granularity or quantify what kind of gains you are getting under market share on portables?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. Sorry, we don’t break out portables in home standby. But I mean from a market share gain perspective, we continue to see our share. I think we spoke publicly last year and on quarterly calls previously. We felt that our share was somewhere in that low 20% to approaching mid 20% range and we feel like we’re probably gaining. Obviously the growth in that share has slowed as we kind of approach, maybe more of steady state here of kind of that mid to upper 20% range of share. But we have picked up, we believe a few more points here on the quarter just year-over-year.
Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And then on the C&I I don’t know if you mentioned, what’s the core growth rate on C&I ex-acquisitions?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, as I said, we had very strong organic growth on C&I. It was probably in that high 30% range so and we saw strong growth there, highlighted by what I talked about from those national count customers, seeing significant capital spending from those national count customers.
Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets: And just following on the telecom side of that, can you quantify how much of that C&I growth came out of the telecom market?
Aaron Jagdfeld: No. Again, we don’t break up the different verticals just from a competitive standpoint, but it’s obviously an important part of our C&I business and was a driver as we mentioned.
Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets: Big driver.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Driver, we saw it ramped up. Sorry, Charlie?
Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets: You had majority of that C&I growth in the quarter in telecom?
Aaron Jagdfeld: No. We saw growth. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, even in our -- the light commercial products continue to do very well, the natural gas products for small footprint retail. Those are really not telecom oriented. So broadly, we saw also with our Magnum business, the large national rental accounts were also pretty good purchasers of equipment in the quarter. So that’s something that -- those things were all drivers basically.
Charlie Brady - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Charlie.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Please proceed.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America: Yeah. Thanks guys. Good morning.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning Ross.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America: I just had a few questions. First of all, is there any way to look at your standby sales on more of it like a same-store basis and what I’m getting at is, is your sales growth really due to expanded distribution or are your existing dealers also seeing year-on-year growth.
York Ragen: And so, when we look at all of those figures and we haven’t reported them publicly but we have seen growth in what we -- what I think you would traditionally referred to as a same-store sales type number. So we are seeing that increase there as well as just raw points as we said, net dealer ads in general as well, so it’s really both.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America: Okay. And then on the portable side, I mean what’s your sense on inventory in the channel now given that it’s been a light hurricane season. And if that continues I realize we’ve got a few weeks left, would you expect that you’ve got a couple of quarters of destocking to go through in portables, or does it feel like the inventories were actually pretty balanced in the chain?
Aaron Jagdfeld: No. Inventories are definitely heavier. They’re seasonally appropriate ahead of events, but as you indicated they are having -- it’s been a pretty quite season thus far. So inventory in the channel for portable generators is at elevated levels. And I wouldn’t say they are beyond seasonally appropriate, but should we not -- should have remained quiet for the balance of the season here. We’ll go through the normal destocking effort a couple of quarters, is an appropriate way to think about that. So that’s the way we think about it when we plan for it. We plan not only -- but we’ve gotten our inventories here but also in the channel. We look at it in totality and then we decide kind of we’ll make a -- take a call on what we think the season is going to look like and we plan accordingly. And if you don’t get a season, you just have to burn that off. Again, for my comments about increased shelve space and market share, we’ve got the placement to be able to do that. So it doesn’t concern us. We’ll monetize the inventory and we’ll adjust our purchases and manufacturing accordingly if the season remains quiet.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America: Okay. Thanks, Aaron. And then I was just asking, I mean you referred to the new and higher baseline a couple of times in your last few quarters, has that meant at all to be initial comment on 2014, anything you can say at this point about your level of confidence in growth for the next several quarters as we head into your, perhaps your tougher comps on the back of Sandy?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, I mean the new higher baseline comments is the one that we’ve actually used over the years, because I think it -- as we’ve said when you have a category and I’m referring to home standby generators now. When you have a category of product like that, that’s really in its infancy, it’s an emerging categories. Another word, we’ve referred to it as -- it takes a while to spool that up in terms of penetration rates. And you can look back at other installed home products as proxies over the years whether you are talking about home security or whether you are talking about central air-conditioning and it takes a period -- it takes, frankly a long period of time to ramp up penetration rates. In our world, what you’ll see from time to time is these accelerated points of adoption along the curve and that is really the result of large scale kind of large awareness events or ravage events things like Sandy or Irene, which can accelerate the adoption rates, so they could go faster for a period of time and then you kind of fall into a new, as we referred to it a new and higher base line level of demand. You can’t hold on to that demand or a good part of that demand. And the reasons for that as we’ve talked in the past, it’s that distribution that we’re expanding, right. So now you’ve got distribution points in markets that tier two, four haven’t had distribution and you’ve got increased awareness in general so. And the category is still very much word of mouth. It’s still very much in a vital marketing phase, so as one person gets one of these products and there are maybe five or six or ten neighbors around them to see that product and the next time there is an outage in their local neighborhood, their house is the only one that’s lit up. It’s takes on kind of a viral type of approach in terms of the next home owner that buys. And that’s really what is at the heart of our direct marketing strategies with our amp -- simulation of our amp data and some of the other sales and marketing initiatives we have been working on. But that’s really my comment on the new and higher baseline. Its grows and kind of holds until you get the next catalyst and there is some seasonality certainly in that as well that you will see from quarter-to-quarter, but that’s really what the comments about.
Ross Gilardi - Bank of America: Okay. Thanks. I’ll get back in the line.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Great.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab. Please proceed.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Good morning and congratulations on another great quarter.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Brian.
York Ragen: Thanks, Brian.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: First question, there is a lot of comments in your prepared remarks around warranty and some questions here in the Q&A. I just want to make sure that I’m understanding something correctly. How do you calculate the warranty rate and could the recent jump in sales that you’ve seen over the last three, four quarters have an impact on that just by virtue of boosting the denominator in that calculation and having a bunch of new equipment in the field?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. So we look at warranty rate claims history and then we bounce that claims history against when we sold those units originally. So you go back in time to when you sold the units, not to that quarter sales per say and that current quarter sales. So the warranty rate is indicative of when you sold the units back in whatever the sale period is. So, I think we’re calibrating and there is an issue what you are referring to where you are just increasing your sales in that particular quarter that would cause a sort of an artificial lower warranty rate?
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: No. It’s really the result of a meaningful decline in that experience rate.
York Ragen: The claims.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. The claims experience rates as York is indicating and the application of that, there is two pieces to it, right. There is the application that lower claims rate again -- that lower experience rate against future sales as you accrue warranty dollars in the future but then there is a release of the reserves which is really the adjustment that we talked about here.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Non run ratable.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Non run ratable piece that we talked about and that’s, so it’s really two pieces to moving warranty but…
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Yeah. Sure. I understand that there are the two pieces but just trying to make sure that I understood whether the second piece -- going from a 150 basis points to 230 was more a function of quality, I guess it sounds like it’s exclusively really a function of quality improvements rather than math.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, right.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then can you give us a sense at all for when you think Baldor will close beginning of the quarter or end of the quarter. I mean I guess we are already into the quarter but closer to very end of the year or not?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. We’ve got some things to work through yet, towards closing so we are kind of in between signing and close here just documents and things to need to get buttoned up but more we would hope within the next 30 days that we are closed on the deal.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: Okay. Great. And then just one last question some hurricane activity in Mexico recently have seen any impact on Ottomotores’ business as a result of that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. Ottomotores is much more of a commercial and industrial focused business. So, longer term you can see impact from outage events on commercial and industrial but it doesn’t have -- they don’t have portable generators that they manufacture and sell in that business at this point. We are expanding our own distribution of portables and home standbys into Mexico through Ottomotores. It’s a part of the synergies that we like about that business that gives us a platform. But obviously those products are sold mainly through retail and we have to build those relationships. So there will be no -- you wouldn’t expect any major near-term impact from that, maybe longer-term impact on the C&I business and Ottomotores.
Brian Drab - William Blair & Company: All right. Okay. Thank you very much.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Brian.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Please proceed.
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird: Morning guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Morning Mike.
York Ragen: Hi Mike.
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird: So first, just want to get a sense for the puts and takes on the margin line as we head into fourth quarter here. Obviously, very strong revenue guidance and the EBITDA guidance relative to the revenue guidance seem to imply some pressure on that margin line going from 3Q to 4Q. I’m sure there is a lot of very understandable reasons, but I just want to make sure I understand some of the puts and takes that would imply some lower margins relative to where we stand in the third quarter besides obviously the warranty expense item that we’ve already kind of talked about?
York Ragen: Yes. I think so the warranty non-rental piece you got to factor that out.
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird: Yes.
York Ragen: And then I think really it’s a function of once you do all the math on our guidance and you’d see a bit of a mix shift there between C&I and resi. So I think that mix shift would have an impact. And I think that’s the biggest piece of it, Mike, to be fair.
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird: Yes. That makes sense. I mean you’re basically implying there the seasonal uptick that you tend to get in the fourth quarter on that piece of the business relative to some of the pricing points.
York Ragen: Yes.
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird: Okay. That makes sense. Yes. And then…
York Ragen: Yes. That’s part of that.
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird: Yes. And then on the Baldor business, maybe, just talk a little bit strategically about that. The confidence you have going up a little bit more aggressively against some of the larger players on the industrial business, the positioning that Baldor currently has in the market. I know it’s not a large slice of the market today but the confidence in the technology and its ability to go against those guys, start there, please?.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So Mike, this is Aaron. Strategically, Baldor -- we had made a strategic decision internally as part of Powering Ahead and as part of our efforts to -- in particularly, in Powering Ahead to increase our share of the C&I market. That’s really the strategic objective we’re after here. And we were going to do that organically. And as we looked at the cost of that and the time it takes to do that organically, when this asset became available, we saw an opportunity to accelerate that. And so, again, they were purpose-built facility. It’s actually here in Wisconsin, which fits our footprint very well. But the underpinning of why we even wanted to get into the higher power ranges and get up against some of the bigger guys in the market, there is for us to be, I think, to have full mindshare with distribution in the Commercial and Industrial market. So we’ve got 42 dealers in the U.S. And they get full mindshare from these dealers. They’re generator dealers. And so they all power ranges because they’re generator guys. They don’t just sell up to 600KW or approach the over 600KW market in the way we do with our modular solution, which fits certain applications but not all. We saw that really the only path for us if we’re going to be serious about C&I going forward is that we have to be a full-line provider. We have to have a 100% of their mindshare, because we couldn’t let them buy those higher power range products from guys like Baldor or others and because Baldor has a full line as well. So it’s kind of, what we refer to as camel’s nose under the tent in terms of -- you can’t allow another OEM into your distribution to sell part of the product line. So it really takes away from your ability to get that deal or focused on everything that you want to focused on 100% and invest in Generac business as opposed to Generac and others. So that was really the genesis of the strategic thinking behind it and again the timing was just accelerated here with Baldor assets becoming available.
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird: And if I remember correctly from my days when I covered Baldor, pretty quality assets, maybe just there compare and contrast maybe what they are bringing to the table, obviously are you reference of fact that they are not modular solutions then you guys are. But from a peer quality of product standpoint, how do you guys look at it and compare to with what you have and maybe peer group as well?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. We -- again we did a lot of diligence on this on the front end but Baldor has pretty good name in the market place in our market place relatively to the product quality. They do manufacture not only standby rate of machines, but prime duty machines as well and that usually where you’re going to see a prime duty machine typically would be outside the U.S.  Now most of their volumes in the U.S. and Canada where you see prime duty equipment inside the U.S. and Canada is going to be in the oil field services, its going to be in the energy production sectors where those piece of equipment are running either 24/7 or close to it where you totally power not available and so you have to have a quality machine to that. And so that -- the engineering efforts, the design, the manufacturing that they put into that product to make it that robust extensions through also into their standby products. So what we feel we’re getting here is the high quality product line that we think we can do some things with both from a revenue synergy as I indicated with combining a distribution in our prepared remarks but then on the cost side, we continue to position ourselves as a more significant purchaser from a sourcing standpoint not only diesel engines but other components that you would find typically in a generator. We also have the ability we think to extend some of the things that we do vertically from a vertical innovation standpoint into these products to help lean out the product cost structure for the Baldor product line and then again to play on the back of manufacturing and sourcing scale. We think there is some good cost synergies opportunities there once we close. It’s still pretty early as we indicated in the comments but when we get there, hopefully next quarter, we will give people a better steer on what we are thinking about for synergies for that business.
Mike Halloran - Robert Baird:  Great, stuff. Appreciate the time.
Aaron Jagdfeld: All right. Thanks Mike.
York Ragen: Thank Mike.
Operator: The next question in queue is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed sir.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: Good morning.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Morning Jerry.
York Ragen: Morning Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: Aaron, can you talk about your broader portfolio at this point a lot of additions pieces coming together. What are the next areas that you are focused on just give us a broad sense? Are you still looking to add additional pieces to the C&I portfolio or does this pretty much get you what you need in the U.S. and then what other regions look interesting to you?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think from a peer -- it’s a great question Jerry. From a peer U.S. and Canada domestic market, if you will, standpoint as it relates to the one strategic objective that we have which is to increase our C&I market share, I think the Baldor acquisition certainly puts us on a pathway there. There could be other ancillary type of products that refer more to the generator space that might be interesting but frankly that I think we are closing in on kind of being where we want to be there from that strategic objective. From a diversification strategic objective and then also expanding geographies which are two other legs of the stool, there are plenty of other assets and other companies for us to continue to consider. Our M&A pipeline is still very full. We think that there are opportunities to kind of continue to build that out. Other products that could fit into the distribution that we built here either through the Magnum distribution in the rental markets or through our own distribution here on the C&I side. And then certainly internationally, there are whole regions of the world where we’re really not attacking yet aggressively, southeastern Asia. We’ve got a toehold in Europe now in Tower Light, but that’s really on a -- that’s a mobile construction equipment play. We really haven’t sought for stationary power generation yet. So there are ton of opportunities. The western hemisphere we’re getting better with Ottomotores. We’ve got Brazil. We’ve just reconstituted the Ottomotores Brazil entity. We combined it with Tower Light out of Brazil entity. We combined those entities and created a Generac Brazil entity which is a new entity down there, which got a facility and it’s got staff. And then we’ve got our -- obviously our facilities to Mexico through Ottomotores. But I look out and I see a lot of opportunity yet in our pipeline. We’re being pretty aggressive on that. And obviously with our free cash flow characteristics, we think that continued to put the cash flow to work in this manner to accelerate our Powering Ahead plan is a good use of cash.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: And Aaron, can you give us an update on the margin performance on acquired Tower Light and Ottomotores business? I know Tower Light you haven’t had that long, but perhaps you can give us an update on how that’s doing so far and what have you seen out of the margin profile Ottomotores versus the prior owner?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, I mean Ottomotores, I’ll focus on that first. We haven’t broken out Tower Light but it is, as we said I think publicly, it’s a good, very good margin business, Tower Light, much better than what you would see traditionally here in the U.S. in a mobile equipment company. But in Ottomotores, as we said before that was a business we bought that had been underinvested in. This product cost structure was not as lean as we would have liked to see in it. We’ve done some rationalization of the manufacturing footprint. They already were moving in the right direction I think to get that to lean that out. And we are bullish on where the synergies could go with that business. I think we publicly stated $2 million in cost synergies for Ottomotores. We feel like we are definitely on track with that. But what we learned even with Magnum, as an example, that was an acquisition we did two years ago is that when you get into second and then ultimately the third year that’s where you start to I think really sharpen your pencil when it comes to other potential synergies. And we think that will be the case as well with Ottomotores as we go forward and lean out that cost structure and really start to use our scale, our new found scale here in purchasing and manufacturing to the benefit of that business from a margin standpoint.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: And then lastly, you mentioned earlier in your comments whether there is going to be some seasonality in your residential business over the next couple of quarter. It’s been a while since we’ve had a typical seasonal year from a storm standpoint. Can you just flash that out for us? You mentioned I think standby should be flat in 4Q versus 3Q. What’s the typical seasonal pattern as you see it into the early part of next year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Actually -- we mentioned in our remarks that standby is going to be actually up in the fourth quarter. So we are actually expecting that to be up. We do expect again to -- from a seasonal standpoint if it remains a quiet season here for the balance, the fourth quarter from a portable generator standpoint, we would see further declines in the run rates on portable generators in the fourth quarter. And then you -- we are formulating working through our guidance in 2014 right now pursuant to all my comments both prepared and here in Q&A. We’ve got a tremendous amount of initiatives that we’ve been focused on to drive the company forward. You look at the residential, let’ say, new and higher base line we talk about all the things from app to PowerPlay to are in commercial, the power you control in commercial that launched here in May. Those things are all having an impact we believe on that base line and on extending the awareness here of portable -- excuse me -- our standby generators. But when we get around to the fourth quarter result that’s when we give a much tighter read on guidance. Certainly seasonality, if we get a quite period, I think the one thing we would say, we get a quite season here seasonality from a quarterly basis 2014, we probably look a lot like what it has in the past without storms. So last year was different because you are coming around from storm. 2011 was different because you are coming off of Irene. So I don’t think you’d expect the same type of seasonality with respect to the quarterly numbers as it relates to residential, if we have a continued quite period here this season.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you very much.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy from Canaccord. Please proceed.
John Quealy - Canaccord: Hey, good morning guys. Congratulations.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, John.
John Quealy - Canaccord: The first question is on the dealer ads. So if you go back trailing four quarters, you publicly stated you are adding about 100 net per quarters, since Q1. And I think the Q4 ‘12 to Q1 ‘13 jump was about 200 dealers, but can you comment on the gross adds there or how you are feeling with churn and what I mean about churn is the dealers more profitable than they were or could you just comment on a little bit more on the dealer metrics? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So what we’ve said with respect to dealer ads, we’ve always reported those numbers on a net basis. I would tell you this, John, we haven’t seen anything out of the ordinary return that would create an issue for us there that we foresee at this point. So that’s pretty consistent. But what I would say is -- and we said in our comments, we’ve added -- we’ve got 1,000 net dealer adds since the end of 2011. And that’s -- when you look at that, I mean there is a material increase in our base offering about 5,200 today. So essentially we are in the low 4,000s at that point and that end of 2011. And we do track on a same-store sale basis as I said previously, we are seeing improvements in top line run rate. From an economic standpoint, the broader the base of product that gets out in the marketplace with 3% penetration today and had it higher, there is a lot of product out there from a service standpoint, service opportunity standpoint both on an annual service basis but we are also -- we are connecting customers who purchased their products through other non dealer channels, we are connecting those to our dealers, because our dealers are best equipped from a training standpoint, a technical ability standpoint to repair, service and maintain products. So if somebody goes and buys a product from a big box retailer or online any of the many other channels where they are available that’s great. We give great accessibility to product but at the end of the day it is a mechanical product and does need to be serviced. That’s really the economics for the dealer. And so improving profitability, I think it’s going to be a direct result of the increase in base of product that’s out there and available to be serviced.
John Quealy - Canaccord: And in terms of sort of margin per standby unit, anecdotally it sounds like Mobilink has had a pretty decent uptake and I got to imagine that decent margin is an add-on sort of product to the core stationary. Can you comment a little bit about how you’re feeling with applications like Mobilink. What you think the uptick was tracking to your expectations?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. Mobilink is exceeding our expectations here in the first year of the launch. We just launched that product earlier in 2013 here. And that is a great way for people to interact with the product, text messages, email, they can go online. We’ve got some other development around that product. That type of remote monitoring is really the class of product that we’re talking about there. And its -- really it’s a revenue model that we haven’t had here. We’re dealing directly with end consumers. We’re selling the service, if you will. In a lot of cases, the service in the first year has given away free as a way to entice people to get kind of soak into the product here and get used to using it. But we think there’s been a nice take rate so far on it. We like the product. We’re looking to expand it other places and do some other things with it going forward. And we see -- there’s an opportunity to build not only better customer interaction with the product, but also a revenue model there that is a much more recurring revenue stream than we’ve had in anything we do there other than maybe service parts. But it’s very much in infancy and as it matures, I’m excited about where that could go.
John Quealy - Canaccord: Perfect. And then lastly real quick, York, I’m sorry if I missed this but I could imagine coppers in your favor. Can you talk about forward purchasing or hedging that you’re doing there? Thanks guys.
York Ragen: Yes. We’ve got some, I guess what we call more opportunists. We have a formal hedging program. We’ve some opportunistic hedges out there, but they are more short-term in nature and more modest in nature. And so I guess I wouldn’t say that we’re locked in on copper at today’s levels.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Operator, do we have anybody else left in queue?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond. Please proceed.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hi, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Maybe to ask the -- I mean, you mentioned home standby being up into the fourth quarter and I think you’ve talked in the past kind of 12 month afterglow on the longer end. Can you just talk about -- I mean, is the resiliency there a function of kind of AMP PowerPlay in the new dealers or maybe just talk about what you’re seeing on in terms of momentum on web hits and registrations and leads?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. So, Jeff I think, probably I’m not going to give you any new here, other than what’s in my prepared remarks. But just that the fact that, when you combine all those things, right, I mean, those are all new programs. I think you just mentioned and there is the third one which is the infomercial as well. So you take AMP, you take PowerPlay, you take the infomercial, both AMP and PowerPlay were kind of in testing phase late last year, fully rolled out here beginning of the year and then the power you control in infomercial are direct response. TV campaign was rolled in May. When you put all of that together, I think its having -- everything is the evidence that we show. Obviously, we’re looking at closure rates on at the dealer level. And the impact of those tools that were giving people and those marketing initiatives and what we’re definitely seeing that our closure rates is a result, we believe of those items. And that’s why we’re going to continue to focus on those going forward here, through the balance of ‘13 and actually end of ‘14 as well. I think it’s not out of the question to see us do something’s not only to the aggressive level, we’re already doing them, but maybe even further with some of those things. The point here what we’re trying to make is that, obviously you’re going to get events like Sandy. You’re going to get events Irene from time and again that’s just -- that’s the way it works. And that’s going to accelerate adoption rate for the category at points in the curve. But as we build out this base and as it becomes a more mainstream category of product. We think we just got a -- we’ve got a great opportunity here to take and extend the awareness from those types of events but then do some meaningful structural things like what we are doing in a sales and marketing side to keep that running forward on a positive basis. Obviously, we said in our prepared remarks about Q4 and you referenced that as well. And again, I would call out the prior revision or more normal seasonality patterns with these types of products once you get into next year, if the season remains quite, but very bullish on the new baseline that we are building at this point.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: And what’s the -- what’s the new boggy as you kind of surpass these 20% dealer on Powerplay. What’s kind of the new bogey to think about in terms of adoption rates there?
Aaron Jagdfeld: That’s a great question. I haven’t given a tremendous amount of thought. We are in the middle of our planning stage right now. We are having some dialog back and forth with our team here to make sure we’re all aligned on what we do think that is, but I think it’s a meaningful step up. I think part of it is you have to look at, there is a 20% that have adopted, they don’t represent just 20% of the sales. Its generally that the dealers who are more heavily involved in the category from a mind share standpoint, from a staffing standpoint resource standpoint. So that 20% of dealers that have adopted that’s on dealer account basis that represents more than 20% of the dollar. So obviously, there is a point of dimension in terms you push this out and push it out, but you are getting connected to smaller and smaller dealer that’s one side of the coin. The other side of the argument that we make or I would like to make here is that but you don’t know where the next great deal is going to come from, you sign up for dealer and gets involved in category for the first time. If you give that dealer the right tools to be successful. And they are entrepreneurial enough to promote the category, promote the business in there and they do the things that we ask them to do. They could have great success with that. So you can’t just say because they are small dealer today we shouldn’t push it. They could be a big dealer tomorrow as a result of pushing it. So its really -- I don’t want to quote a number at this point but I would think we are going to be pushing hard to a get a number and we will get you something on that when we get to next year.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. Then just a couple of housekeeping items on the acquisitions. Can you quantify what the acquired revenue was in the quarter?
York Ragen: When we talk about organic growth for C&I in the that high 30% range, so if we would grew 62% in C&I, the delta there would be acquisitions, Jeff.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. And you had two months of Tower Light?
York Ragen: We had really one if you think about it.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah really one unfortunately Italy kind of shuts down for a month or so in August.
York Ragen: In August.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We buy a company and it closes but.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. That’s probably why it seems like a lower number. And then…
York Ragen: Yes.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You got to think about that in terms of the run rate, correct.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Is there any way that kind of give us a rough size, trailing 12 month sales on Baldor and kind of where any profitability metrics in terms of where they stand relative to your other businesses?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean we haven’t disclosed revenues for some pretty competitive reasons there but I think obviously as we’ve said, the current businesses is not optimized. I mean so when you look at the profitability of that business today I think we really believe that there is an opportunity to take our scale, to take our manufacturing capabilities to really go after leaning out that product cost structure and doing some things there. There is also some great revenue synergies that, this is the product line that our dealers don’t have access to directly from Generac. They do from others but not all of our dealers are in this market because we don’t offer it. And we are going to have -- we’ll have some nice synergies with that. There’s some great connection of synergies between the Magnum business and the Baldor business relative to the rental markets and the oil and gas markets. We’re really excited about that. We think that there’s an opportunity there to do something that is pretty cool. But the other think I would mention, this is a carve-out of a much bigger business, right. So it’s a -- and we’re buying assets. So it’s a little hard to really kind of look at the true profitably. You can do as much as you can do in diligence to try and figure out what it would run rate too. But at the end of the day until you really get it in-house and we assimilate into our portfolio of both on a facility basis and the way we do manufacturing as well as from a product basis and the way we design products. I think we’ll have a better glimpse ones we get this in closed and get into the next quarter, Jeff, we’ll maybe able to make some more comments on it then.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital:  Okay. Thanks guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please proceed sir.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey Chris.
Operator: I don’t know what happened. I don’t know if he disconnected. (Operator Instruction) He is in the call. He is back in, one moment.
Aaron Jagdfeld: All right.
Operator: Okay, Christopher Glynn.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Yes. Can you hear me?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes.
York Ragen: Hi Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Hi. Good morning. Not sure what happened there. So we’ve been talking about new higher resi base line in -- from my question I don’t think there’s any possibility of an empirical answer. But if you have any gut thoughts on how much of what we are seeing right now is the new baseline versus some element of extended afterglow?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Obviously, what gets really hard to part on this and we talk about this on other calls is, you’ve had -- so you had -- if you go back, right, we had not only Sandy, we had Irene, we had the snow storm in October Snowtober, I think is referred to. There are the numerous outages out in east coast, smaller to larger. They all build on each other and so to try and parse apart, day flying versus what’s coming off of which outage. I mean what you point to and it’s just really, we try to do that scientifically, we try to do it from a gut perspective and both ways. What we continue to focus on Chris is, is expanding distribution and focusing on the programs and the tools that we put on hand of those dealers that we are putting out on the street to sell our products. And then some of the more, I would say national level on regional level marketing campaigns that we’ve been ramping up here to get the product category in front of more people and explain it to more people but that …
York Ragen: Create our own awareness.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. To create our own awareness if you will, to create our own storm if you will but that’s really what we are focused on here going forward because that’s -- it’s a really that strategy to sit around and watch the weather channel. I mean that’s not -- that’s not a strategy for our business.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: It’s not. Okay. And then if we look at the mix in the margin impact in the fourth quarter understand but would that be probably a good proxy to start thinking about 2014 as things have kind of coming down a little on the residential fact?
York Ragen: Yes. Chris, this is York. We are pulling those numbers here, now so we haven’t commented on 2014 margins. At this point, we haven’t given any guidance on 2014 or so. We are still pulling out to get ourselves, so it would be pretty mature to have comment on 2014 margins.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Fair enough. Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: All right.
Operator: There is no further question in queue. And now I would like to turn the call over to Aaron Jagdfeld for closing remarks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you. We want to thank everyone this morning for joining us. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings results which will be out sometime in February of next year. So with that, we thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your patience -- participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 Generac Holdings Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Katrina and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a Q&A session towards the end of the presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.
York Ragen: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I'll now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report our second quarter 2013 results this morning, which we believe continue to demonstrate the powerful macro growth drivers for our business as well as the ongoing progress we are making in executing our Powering Ahead strategic plan. Our second quarter net sales increased 45% over the prior year to $347 million with very strong double-digit organic growth which remain broadly based across our product categories at all major regions in United States. We are particularly impressed with the organic growth that we have experienced when considering as follows the prior year second quarter in which net sales increased nearly 50% over the second quarter of 2011. We converted this robust revenue growth into even higher growth rates for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of 65% and 64% respectively, as we saw a 320 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin during the quarter versus prior year. Growth in shipments of home standby generators were again very strong during the quarter as the market for these products continues to develop with more home owners becoming aware of the importance of having a backup power system. As home owners experience more frequent and longer duration power outages, they are increasingly seeking technology solutions which ensure their basic comfort, safety and expected standard of living. As a result, home standby generators are becoming more mainstream, given this increased need and awareness. The accelerated adoption rates for these products has led to further expansion of our residential and light commercial distribution network, ending the second quarter with over 5100 dealers which is nearly a 1000 more since the end of 2011. As we support the increased awareness with expanded distribution, we believe we are driving a new and higher baseline level of demand for home standby generators. As the clear leader in the home standby generator category over the last decade with approximately 70% market share, we believe it is incumbent upon us to continue to drive growth and increase the penetration rate of this emerging backup power solution in household across the United States. We are supplementing the main growth drivers of an extended afterglow period and expanded distribution with some new and exciting sales and marketing initiatives to further increase the awareness of home standby generators. These initiatives include our AMP targeted marketing process, our power play in-home selling solution and our recently launched national advertising campaign. The number of dealers using power play continue to grow during the second quarter as we are well on our way to achieving an approximate 20% adoption rate by our dealer base by the end of the year. We are very pleased with this rollout so far as we are still seeing a notable improvement in sales closure rates for dealers using this new and innovative sales tool. In addition, our power you control direct response television advertising campaign was recently launched at the end of May, and we are selectively targeting certain national networks as well as specific local regions of the country. Although still early in the campaign, we are encouraged with the response rate relative to other forms of direct marketing. The sales leads we are generating come directly into our lead management team here at Generac where they are qualified and directed to our dealers who are using power play thereby leveraging our investment and increasing the likely closure rate. With penetration rates at only approximately 3% of single family unattached houses in the U.S. we believe there remains a substantial opportunity for us to continue to grow the market for home standby generators. We also experienced a strong double-digit year-over-year increase in portable generator shipments during the second quarter of 2013 to the combination of inventory replenishment and overall expanded placement for these products at our retail customers. Shipments of portable generators during the first half of 2013 have significantly exceeded our expectations. Unlike previous major power outages where demand for portable generators increases rapidly and then settles back down to baseline relatively quickly, we are seeing a longer tail of demand following super storm Sandy. We believe this extended period of elevated demand as well as further market share gains have driven our outperformance of portable generator shipments so far in 2013. Our ongoing success in portable generators after reentering this product category in 2008 has further solidified our leading position in providing a full range of backup power products to the residential market. In doing so, we have positioned the Generac brand as being the household name in backup power. Also contributing to the year-over-year sales growth in residential products in the second quarter was an increase in revenues from power washers. We've developed the full line of washers since reentering the market in 2011, which includes the recently introduced OneWash the industry's only variable speed power washer. OneWash is a premium priced product addition which serves as an important compliment to our existing broad product line which has price points in the entry level to the midpoint range. This new power washer product has met our initial expectations including positioning Generac as the leader in providing some much needed innovation to this market. With the successful roll out of the new product as well as increased placement of our consumer and prosumer units and our retail channel partners, we believe we are making good progress in growing our market share in the power washer product category. Demand for our commercial and industrial stationery generators continues to see very good momentum due to the increased awareness of the need for backup power in the part of businesses. In particular, we experienced strong revenue growth from our telecom national account customers during the second quarter as wireless providers look to further safeguard their network from future outages. The need for reliable mobile voice and data has become increasingly more important and as a result wireless carriers are facing both increasing competitive and regulatory pressures to harden their networks. As the market leader in the telecommunication segment we believe providing backup power for this critical communications infrastructure represents the compelling secular growth opportunity for the Company.  Additionally, we continue to see attractive revenue growth from shipments of light commercial generators used in smaller footprint retail applications as market interest in cleaner burning more cost effective natural gas fuel backup generators continues to increase as a result of the exceptional value proposition of these products. As power outages are becoming more prevalent, business owners are also becoming keenly aware of the need for backup power to protect their revenue streams and perishable inventories. Helping to increase the awareness in this optional standby market is a key corporate initiative for 2013. And recently we launched a concentrated direct marketing campaign, our largest such effort to-date targeted at several businesses in the light commercial category, including a particular focus on gas stations and convenience stores. Our campaign is centered around driving awareness of the return on investments that these products have for particular businesses as well as educating business owners on the amount of hours on average that utility power is lost over the course of the year in their local area. We are developing specific sales tool for both our national account sales team, and our independent dealer sales team to use in demonstrating the payback of standby generators. Given the relatively low penetration of light commercial backup generators, we believe there is a large growth opportunity that exists by focusing on improving the adoption rate with small businesses.  We attribute our success over the last several years to the development and execution of our Powering Ahead strategy. Since mid 2010, the strategic plan has served as a framework for the significant investments we have made to drive the baseline growth of Generac. As a quick review, this strategy is organized around four key growth objectives. First, by growing the residential standby market. Secondly by gaining commercial and industrial market share; third by diversifying our end markets with expanded product offerings and services; and fourth by expanding into new geographies. We've remained intensely focused on the first objective of Powering Ahead by making significant investments to roll the residential standby generator market through our numerous initiatives targeted at increasing the awareness, availability and affordability of these products. We have resourced this particular objective with a strong infrastructure and the investments we have made to-date have helped us capitalize on the powerful growth drivers within the residential products portion of our business. At the same time, we have also been focused on better balancing the overall products and markets that we serve through our three remaining Powering Ahead strategic objective. Most of this diversification has been achieved over the last couple of years through several strategic acquisitions that have given us access to new products, new markets and new customers. Our Magnum product acquisition has allowed us to enter the mobile power equipment market that predominantly serves the construction and energy sectors through rental channels. Our Ottomotores acquisition has given us access to larger output power generation equipment serving the Latin American market. In addition the launch of our power washer product line has allowed us to leverage our existing retail customer relationships, supply chain and manufacturing capacity. We believe there are significant opportunities for growth in the global power generation and engine powered equipment markets. And we are committed to pursuing these through organic initiatives as well as maintaining an active M&A pipeline. Another example of our efforts to become a more balanced company with improved global focus can be found in our announcement last week of the signing of an agreement to acquire Tower Light, a leading European developer and supplier of mobile light towers with headquarters outside Milan, Italy. With distribution in over 50 countries Tower Light is a great strategic fit for Generac's business, providing an expanded product offering of light tower generators to support additional geographic market from those we serve today. When combined with our Magnum mobile product, this acquisition positions Generac as the global leader of light towers, allowing us to participate in the growing rental market outside the U.S. With over 100 employees and approximately EUR37 million in net sales in fiscal 2012 Tower Light customers and end-users buy their product not only on price but they also place a high level of importance on innovation, durability and sustainability. The product line today includes the industry's widest range of LED based lighting towers as well as several hybrid lighting solutions that drive dramatic improvements in fuel efficiency. Tower light operates the flexible development and product environment which allows them to provide customized product design for specific applications where local market demands with relatively short lead times leading to premium margins for the company. Although early in the process of exploring opportunities for revenue synergies, we have already identified several attractive cost saving opportunities that we are currently evaluating. With respect to cost synergies, we are estimating that over the next 18 months we can drive approximately $1 million in component related savings on an annualized run rate basis. The execution of our Powering Ahead strategy has resulted in a more balanced company with improved global focus, and when combined with the powerful macro opportunities in the residential and light commercial backup power market, we believe we have the right strategy in place to drive future growth and ensure the value. I would now like to turn the call over back to York to discuss second quarter results in more detail. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. Net sales for the second quarter of 2013 was $346.7 million, a 45% increase as compared to $239.1 million in the second quarter of 2012. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales increased 59.3% to $196.6 million in the second quarter of 2013 relative to a prior year net sales comparison of $123.4 million, which saw year-over-year sales growth of 34% over the second quarter of 2011. The growth in the current year was broad-based, primarily driven by very strong double-digit increases in shipments for both home standby and portable generators. With regards to home standby generators, the continued strength in shipments is due to a variety of factors including the continuing demand from recent major power outages driving further adoption of the category, expanded distribution broadening the availability of the product, increased sales and marketing initiatives extending the awareness of the category, overall strong operational execution to satisfy the increased demand and an improving environment for residential investment. Portable generator shipments during the second quarter of 2013 were up strongly in comparison to the prior year quarter. Our broad relationships at retail provide us with an increase in portable generator shelf space over the last several years. As demand remained strong for backup power following the recent major power outages, we are also seeing increased pull through portable generators. We believe our solid execution and working capital investments have allowed us to capture a leading share of the portable generator market. Also contributing to the revenue growth for residential products in the second quarter of 2013 was our growing presence in the market for engine driven power washers.  Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales increased 32% to $133.4 million in the second quarter of 2013 from $101.1 million in the second quarter of 2012. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the Ottomotores acquisition. We also saw strong organic revenue growth for our C&I products due to robust shipments to telecom national account customers as well as increased sales of light commercial natural gas generators using small retail applications. These increases were slightly offset by difficult prior year comparison during the quarter for certain of our mobile products sold through national rental accounts. Our other product sales category improved to $16.6 million in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of 13.7% from the prior year second quarter sales of $14.6 million. This growth is primarily due to increased sales of service parts as the installed base of our products continue to grow with the overall growth of the Company. Gross margin as a percentage of sales for the current year second quarter was 37.8% compared to 36.6% in the prior year second quarter. This 120 basis point improvement was primarily the result of higher mix of home standby generators shipped in the current year quarter, improved pricing and a moderation in product cost due to lower commodities and the execution of cost reduction initiatives. These margin improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from the addition of Ottomotores sales. Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2013 increased $4.2 million or 8.5% as compared to the second quarter of 2012. This increase was primarily driven by operating expenses associated with the Ottomotores business as well as increased sales, engineering and administrative infrastructure to support the strategic growth initiatives and higher baseline sales levels of the Company. Partially offsetting these increases were the $5.9 million decline in the amortization of intangibles. In addition, we are also experiencing improved warranty rates resulting in reduced warranty reserves during the quarter. Excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during the second quarter of 2013 were 13.9%, representing a 200 basis point decline as compared to 15.9% in the prior year quarter. Favorable operating leverage and higher volumes and the improved warranty rates are the main drivers of this 200 basis points improvement. Adjusted EBITDA increased 65% to $90.1 million or 26% of net sales in the second quarter of 2013 as compared to $54.6 million or 22.8% of net sales in the same period last year. Our attractive EBITDA margins improved by 320 basis points in the current year quarter, primarily as a result of the items just mentioned; improved product mix, improved price cost, warranty reserve improvements and leveraging our SG&A infrastructure on the higher organic shipment volumes. Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months as of June 30, 2013 was $358.3 million or 25.8% of net sales during that period. GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2013 was $28.3 million as compared to $9.3 million for the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted net income as defined in our earnings release increased 67% to $66.6 million in the current year quarter versus $39.9 million in the prior year second quarter. This increase is attributable to improved operating earnings during the quarter resulting from a 45% increase in net sales and higher margins, partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher debt levels in interest rates compared to prior year as well as higher cash income taxes. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.40 in the second quarter of 2013 compared to $0.14 per share in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconciled in our earnings release was $0.95 for the current year quarter compared to $0.58 per share in the prior quarter, a 63.8% year-over-year increase. As previously announced on May 31, 2013 the company completed refinancing of its senior secured credit facilities. Pursuant to which, it has incurred $1.2 billion of senior secured term loans to replace its prior term loan facilities. The new term loans will mature in 2020 and will initially bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, the spread of LIBOR of the new term loan can be reduced to LIBOR plus 2.5% to the extent that the Company's net debt leverage ratio falls below 3.0 times. Following the refinancing, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the new term loans to fund a special cash dividend to its stockholders of $5 per share and to pay related financing fees and expenses. The special dividend constituted a declared amount of $342.1 million in the aggregate, of which $340.8 million was paid on June 21, 2013. As a result of the refinancing transaction and other debt prepayments, an extinguishment of debt charge of $13.5 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2013. In summary, the current quarter debt refinancing transaction resulted in a 275 basis point reduction in interest rate as compared to the prior term loan facilities. Despite increasing our overall outstanding debt, this very attractive cost of debt allowed us to reduce our interest expense on an annualized run rate basis by approximately $7 million, resulting in an approximately $0.06 of accretion to adjusted EPS. We are very pleased; we are able to return significant capital to shareholders while at the same time having a refinancing transaction being accretive to adjusted earnings. We were able to accomplish all of this while maintaining a comfortable leverage position at 3.4 times gross debt adjusted EBITDA as of June 30, 2013 and also maintaining flexibility to grow the business with regards to liquidity, covenants and access to additional capital. Interest expense in the second quarter of 2013 increased to $14.3 million compared to $9.9 million in the same period last year. The increase was the result of higher debt levels and interest rates compared to the prior year period. Due to the reduction in interest rates from the current year refinancing transaction completed in May 2013, interest expense during the third quarter of 2013 is expected to be approximately $13 million which includes approximately $1.5 million of deferred financing costs and original issue discount amortization. With regards to cash income taxes, the second quarter of 2013 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $2.7 million, as compared to only $272,000 in the prior year quarter. As we commented during recent conference calls, our cash income taxes for 2013 are expected to increase going forward due to a combination of our NOL carry forward being fully utilized during 2013 and higher overall profitability levels. Cash income taxes for 2013 were previously estimated to be approximately $14 million to $15 million. Based on our increasing guidance for the full year 2013, partially offset by additional tax deductions relating to our recent debt refi, cash income tax expense is now projected to be $15.5 million to $16.5 million for the year, which translates into a cash income tax rate of 6.5% to 7.5%. Importantly, our favorable tax yield through our annual intangible asset amortization in our tax returns remains intact through 2021, resulting in approximately $49 million of cash tax savings per year for the next nine years. As a result, our cash income tax rate is expected to be significantly lower than our current projected 36% to 38% GAAP income tax rate for the foreseeable future. As we drive higher profitability over time, any incremental pre-tax profit over this tax year will be taxed as we projected 36% to 38% tax rate going forward. Free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx was $30.3 million in the second quarter of 2013, as compared to $17.8 million in the same period last year. Strong operating earnings were partially offset by increased working capital investment, driven primarily by seasonal finished goods inventory replenishment and to a lesser extent higher capital spending levels. Free cash flow over the past 12 months remain strong at $223.3 million. As of June 30, 2013 we had a total of $1.21 billion of bank debt outstanding net of unamortized original issue discount, and $126.6 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in a consolidated net debt of $1.084 billion. Our consolidated net debt to the LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was a comfortable 3.0 times compared to 3.5 times ratio at June 30, 2012. With that, I now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide additional comments on our outlook for the remainder of 2013.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. As a result of the continued strong demand for our products as well as the expected closing of the Tower Light acquisition earlier in the third quarter of 2013, we are again raising our sales guidance for full year 2013. Full year net sales are now expected to increase in the low 20% range over the prior year, which is an increase in the low to mid teens rate previously expected. Specifically for the second half of 2013, net sales are forecasted to increase in the mid single-digit range as compared to the very strong prior year's second half period. Even after excluding the pending Tower Light acquisition, net sales are still forecasted to grow in the lower single-digit range during the second half of 2013 over the prior year period. Importantly, the second half of 2012 had two major power outage events. The mid-Atlantic regions the Rachel early in Q3 and super storm Sandy in the fourth quarter. And our revised top line guidance for 2013 continues to assume no major power outage events for the remainder of this year. Additionally, our guidance also continues to assume no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment. We expect the demand for home standby generators will continue to benefit from increasing awareness and adoption, as a result of the major power outage events that have occurred in recent years along with our expanded distribution which is resulting in the formation of a new and higher baseline level of sales for these products. We also believe the ongoing improvement in the environmental residential investment and execution in our sales and marketing initiatives will further drive home standby penetration rates. As a result, total residential product sales are now expected to increase in the high single-digit range in full year 2013 over the prior year, which compares to the low single-digit growth previously expected. As discussed, our guidance for the remainder of the year does not include any assumptions for major outage events, and prior second half include multiple major outage events. Therefore, as previously guided, we continue to expect a year-over-year decline in shipments of portable generators in the second half of this year. Despite this, we believe we are gaining share in the market for these products through additional retail placement. Net sales for commercial and industrial products are now expected to increase in the low 40% range over the prior year, which is an increase in the low 30% range previously expected. This increasing guidance is primarily due to an improved organic outlook for C&I shipments along with the expected closing of the Tower Light acquisition earlier in the third quarter of 2013.  Excluding the Ottomotores and Tower Light acquisitions, organic revenue growth within the C&I product category is now expected to increase at a mid to high teens rate over the prior year, which compares to the high single-digit organic growth rate previously expected. The increased organic growth rate for C&I products is again mostly driven by increased spending from our telecom national account customers as they continue to make investments to improve the reliability of their wireless networks. Our outlook for C&I products continues to assume a modestly improved non-residential construction market in 2013 over the prior year. Summarizing our sales growth assumptions for full year 2013, total Company organic year-over-year growth is now expected to be between 11% and 13%, which represents an increase from our previous guidance of between 5% to 7%. The acquisitions of Ottomotores and Tower Light are expected to contribute between 9% and 10% growth for a total expected year-over-year net sales increase in the low 20% range. Consolidated gross margins for 2013 are still expected to be flat as compared to the prior year. This guidance implies the gross margins in the second half of the year will moderate as the benefit of product cost reduction is more than offset by an expected higher mix of C&I shipments. As a result of maintaining this outlook, we continue to expect full year gross margins of approximately 37% for the third year in a row while we continue to diversify and globalize our business. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding amortization of intangibles are now expected to be flat for full year 2013 as compared to 2012 at approximately 14.5%, which is an improvement from previous expectation of slightly up compared to the prior year. This improved outlook is largely due to an improvement in our warranty rates resulting from our intense focus on improving overall product quality over the last several years. As a result of the higher sales outlook and improved operating expense guidance, we now expect adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2013 to increase in the low 20% range, which is an increase in the low teens percentage range previously expected. We continue to expect cash flow conversion will remain strong during the year and to be consistent with the cumulative average during the past four years of free cash flow, representing between 90% to 95% of our adjusted net income. In closing this morning, we believe our second quarter results further demonstrate the progress we are making in executing our Powering Ahead strategic plan. We delivered very strong organic revenue growth once again this quarter, which was broadly based across our major product categories and all significant regions in the United States. The investments we've been making are driving performance that is exceeding our expectations. And with continued momentum entering the second half, we have raised our outlook accordingly. We believe the powerful macro drivers for our business which includes the under investment in the electrical grid and ageing population and an increasing reliance on uninterrupted power and data will continue to drive further awareness for the need for backup power. Given the relatively low penetration for both home and light commercial standby generators, we believe there is substantial growth opportunity as a leader in this emerging product category. This concludes our prepared remarks and at this time we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, (Operator instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn representing Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: If you can elaborate on the closure rate improvement seen from power play and what you are measuring against because I think previously, you know, you talked about the earlier adopters maybe having higher closure rates to begin with.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Chris, that's a great question and something we are watching very closely as we roll this out. We really like what we are seeing in closure rates. I think it is still too early, it was probably too early in the first quarter that we had it out and I counted on it, but we are pretty excited about what we are looking at. We are digging deeper into that to understand, yeah those again we are targeting kind of about 20% of our dealers to be on power play. I think, yeah, that's 20% of the dealer count. I will say that these are the better dealers, they represent over half the sales that run though our dealer channels which represents the majority of sales in the residential standby category. So we think that as we increase the adoption rate, what we are seeing in closure rate today I think it is another couple of quarters or so we are going to be comfortable that kind of maybe talk more deeply about those improvements. But I'll tell you just my experience having been around this and having watched closure rates for a while, we really like the uptick that we are seeing. The system is having an impact. We definitely know that it's having an impact. We are dialing it in, we've released a couple of different versions of it since the initial version, I think version 3 or 3.5 at this point. We are expanding its functionality; we are expanding the training on it to make sure that you know, it is something that people understand how to fully use. We are now using it in conjunction with this new infomercial program that I've talked about this new campaign, the direct response television campaign that we launched called Power You Control, and that's something that is we are seeing some really interesting things in terms of the impact of both of those things in concert together. So I don't want to quote a specific closure rate, but I can tell you that they are materially higher than they were previous.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks for that. And then on Tower Light wondering if you could comment on margins relative to Generac core and then the revenue geographic split and current growth?
York Ragen: Yeah, Chris this is York. I think with regards to margins, I think it's – Aaron made some comments about their approach to the market and how they approach different geographies around the world as Aaron mentioned, they have distribution that serves about 50 countries around the globe and they have products that service specific needs for each of those markets. And therefore they are able, with that approach they are able to go to the market with premium margin. So I like in it, so I want to compare to say how do they compare to Magnum's margins which what we have commented in the past as more typical mobile equipment here in the North America sold through the national rental accounts. There are better margins in Magnum, probably in the high-teens range but that's pre-synergies. So as we talked about, there are some synergies we have identified. So we want to try to get those approaching 20% there, which are one of the reasons why we like this business was the margins that they are generating.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. And then just maybe the split of Europe and ex-Europe and if it's overall growing right now?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think you are talking about Tower Light Chris?
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Yes please.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, so Tower Light is growing, it's growing from – we disclosed that it was EUR37 million in sales at the end of 2012, we can say that it's grown through the first half of this year. It's on plan definitely growing nicely. Their distribution, about two-thirds of the sales are in Europe and about one-third outside. So, mainly the outside sales are going to the Middle East and Africa, couple of other parts of the world therein. They have distribution like a little bit in Latin America, they have distribution in 50 countries which is another kind of really nice thing we like about this business is with their customer base and with their breadth of their distribution, we think there is some pretty new things we can do with that. In terms of adding additional products if you think about Magnum's product line, little bit fuller product lines there in terms of just outside the light tower, so is the rental market there are some other products that we think could possibly go into Tower Light as well and into those existing customers. So we are pretty excited about that.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Great. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy representing Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter and looks good to get back to positive retained earnings for you guys. So a couple of questions. First, on the standby business, can you talk about relative growth rates I think you talked about for the whole business across the country growth, but can you kind of segment that for us in terms of Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, West? How is the growth trends looking for you folks at this point of the year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah I mean we don't obviously we don't disclose growth rates by regions. But what we can say is obviously as you would expect the growth rates in the northeast, mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions of the U.S. are beyond what they are in other parts of the country. But that being said, we continue to see John even the Midwest we haven't had any major events here in the Midwest to speak of, but yes just the frequency of events that we do get they are more localized in nature. They impact power, we are not talking about weeks on end, you're maybe talking about a day or two or maybe more. But some of our best penetrated states remain here in the Midwest which Illinois, Michigan, parts of even parts of Pennsylvania in terms of Western Pennsylvania there is some great regions of the country here that for us anyway represent good business and good growth rates. And lower growth rates as you would are West where you don't get the severity of weather with the good, most it's underground, and so you've but still growth. And that's the – it's up nicely I mean if you look at that we talk about what's driving that, and again it gets back to this under penetration story across the board that as we continue to drive awareness for the category, drive distribution points more points of lights. We think it's having that kind of an impact with our initiatives and with things that are driving awareness.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity: Okay, great. And then on the portable side it sounds like you guys have been positively surprised on the strengths there, obviously whether it was tough compares year-on-year decline in shipments in the back half of the year, is that channel still ahead of an expected somewhat storm season for the channel Aaron, or what do you think going on in the portable side for the back half?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah there is definitely some inventory replenishment. There is no question in the front half that took place. The second half which we still see, even though there is a good everyday business on portable generators for the same reason that you know I mentioned with power outages that happen every day around the U.S. there is still 0.25 million people or more without power every day in this country. And you know the typical solution for most people is coming out and get a portable generator with our expanded shelf position, retail partners and this has been a category that frankly you know has exceeded my expectations. When we made the decision to get back into it several years ago, you know it was more of a complementary product for us. It really is you know for us it has become a way to strengthen our relationship with our retail partners, a way to really create a brand in Generac that speaks to backup power for the residential in consumer markets and I would say a lot of that come on the backs of our success in portable generator. But a lot of it is you know with inventory replenishment here in the first half of the year and second half I think the replenishment is pretty well done. It's a cycle now, what you're going to see is normal sell through ahead of you know then normal weather patterns, there is seasonality in the category that happens typically late in the second quarter and throughout the third quarter with your active weather patterns around the U.S. just you know summer storm season. 
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity: Yeah. And then last two questions quickly. In terms of the national account business, was that surprising and what are your qualitative expectations for national accounts in the back half of the year?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, so I mean we're watching national accounts with a lot of interest. I mean it's a big piece of our business. We love that business because we think we do it very well, we think we have a good program setup with our national account sales team. You know a lot of it is coming as we said from the telecommunications vertical, we are seeing some traction in other verticals as well. Financial services industry, we've got a couple of national account customers there that are new to us. But it's primarily the telecom space and as in our prepared remarks we said you know it's not only the competitive pressures in terms of uptime with the networks but also the regulatory pressures, the drumbeat there around you know is this going to be our cell towers is going to be regulated relative to meeting backup power. We are watching that with great interest obviously, in terms of the impact it could have for us. But our customers our national account customers are by and large proactive on that already. So it's not like it's going to push them to do it faster. But they are already out there you know and we serve all the major telecom companies. We are the primary suppliers to all of them. It's kind of specialized space. Those products are a little bit niche, they are somewhat customized for each of the different networks and the network providers. We like the future of that as we kind of indicated in our implied guidance here in the back half, a lot of that can be driven by national account business. Some of the other national accounts step on the rental space, are also starting to come alive. The CapEx spending by the larger national rental accounts which is mainly what we serve through our Magnum business, we are starting to see that pickup as well. So we continue to be bullish on national accounts barring any unforeseen pullback on a macro basis in the economy. 
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity: Great, thanks very much guys.
York Ragen: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charley Brady representing BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning guys. This is Andrew joining on for Charley Brady.
York Ragen: Hi, Andrew.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hi, Andrew.
Unidentified Analyst: I was just wondering with respect to rental companies, you guys seeing them just replacing what they have but also kind of expanding their fleets in terms of you know light towers and generators?
Aaron Jagdfeld: That's a great question Andrew. I mean the light tower category in particular has – is one of those categories that's expanding and there is lot of when you talk about the shift to more night time construction that's kind of new market if you will, you know there has always been some amount of night construction. But road construction at night is becoming much more prevalent around the U.S. as you know construction companies, municipality, state governments they try to avoid you know congestion issues that come from shutting down the roadways during the day. The other part of the – the sector there that has obviously come out strong is the oil and gas sector, the energy sector. That has remained relatively soft in the first half this year, the energy sector. But road construction has remained pretty bullish. There is a lot of infrastructure rebuild to go on in this country, so I think there is an expansion of some fleets, certainly there is a replenishment cycle there you know these are products that go above four years in terms of their average life, four to five years that replacement cycle has been pretty heavy in 2011, and all the way into the first half of 2012. You know that started to slowdown but what we are seeing now is those companies are becoming more aggressive at spending CapEx dollars again as we indicated the back half of '13. On the mobile generator side, just to kind of round out the discussion, we are taking share there. Magnum only has been in that market for about six or seven years, and so it takes time to build those relationships, to prove themselves the quality of the product and we continue to deepen our penetration of those products Magnum branded products at their rental customers that are currently buying light towers and that's been a success story for us.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. That was helpful. And I was just wondering if you could quantify the gross margin impact the Ottomotores had in the quarter?
York Ragen: Yes, it's York. I mean it's probably if you are talking the margins were up 120 basis points that there was an offset to that with Ottomotores maybe a 1% to 1.5%.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And last question just is that $13 million in the $1.5 million of deferred financing, the run rate we should use going forward?
York Ragen: Yeah that was the Q3 2013 first full quarter with the new credit facility.
Aaron Jagdfeld: We would remind you that there is a function within that credit facility that if we get to net debt leverage of three times or less, we'll step down a quarter, quick quarter point the LIBOR plus 250 it still remains the 75 basis points more but – 
York Ragen: If the Second quarter of 2014 if our net leverage is below three times, 3.0 times we'll step down to that 2.5 point. It will reduce 0.25%.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah that can bring our run rate down obviously slightly.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Andrew. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond representing KeyBanc Capital. Please proceed.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Hey good morning guys. I don't know if I missed this, but did you give an organic growth rate for the quarter in commercial, or can you give us the Ottomotores contribution?
York Ragen: Yeah, it was – we didn't specifically give it, but we still had about if we grew 32% for C&I all-in, we still had about 11% organic. So still very healthy organic growth on the C&I side for the quarter.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Okay, great. And then you guys I mean clearly you've been talking about a robust demand period, share gains I am just wondering what all of this is within all this what you are seeing from a competitive landscape, are people investing more adding capacity, introducing new products at the rate you guys are, or is it pretty quiet?
Aaron Jagdfeld: No, Jeff I think the main competitors for us in the -- we just talk on standby for a second, the main competitors in that space have been they remain relatively unchanged for the last several years and they've always been aggressive. I think they compete with us in terms of trying to expand the market. But in terms of their level of investment, I think one of the things that benefits Generac is this is our focus, our primary focus whereas the primary focus of most of our competitors is something else first. And so I think in terms of management resource, in terms of financial resource, in terms of focus, I think that benefits us in terms of why we've been able to maintain our share and grow the market on the same breadth here on all the initiatives and things that we are working on. But the competitive side is we are well aware of the opportunity here, it's just a question of focus and a question of resources and time allocation I think by those other companies.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. And then just longer term question about capital allocation, clearly private equities less involved, you had a couple of years of the special dividend. How should we think the same or differently about capital deployment in the out years as you continue to generate strong cash flows?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think we've been pretty consistent in our message on how we're going to allocate capital and the deployment of capital going forward. I mean the first thing we want to put as much capital towards growth as we can in terms of growing the business organically. We've said that we want to pay down debt, I think more confirmable range for us in terms of leverage ratio be somewhere in that two to three times on a net debt basis. So, we think that there is some room to continue to pay down debt. Both on M&A which we've been doing right along here, would kind of be the next priority for us and you see that evidence with another acquisition here we just announced with Tower Light which we really like in terms of broadening the company out both in product and in global scale. And then after that we get through that progression, Jeff I think we'd evaluate what does make sense? Is it time to initiate a regular dividend for the Company for the shareholders, is it – would be another special dividend, share buyback I mean there is range of options there. I think the thing that we want to be our shareholders with the knowledge of it is that we are going to deploy capital in the way that's going to get them the best return and get us the best return. We have lot of opportunities out there for us to grow this company organically and through M&A and I think we are going to be very judicious and we've always have been, it's kind of in our DNA, we are very judicious about how we spend capital there.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital: Great, thanks guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi representing Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ross Gilardi – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Yeah, thanks guys. Good morning.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hey, Ross.
Ross Gilardi – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Yeah I just had a few questions. So your residential growth rate actually accelerated in the second quarter versus the first quarter on a year-on-year basis. Was that comp issue, so the comp just easier or is underlying demand actually accelerating as we get further from Sandy? And can you talk at all about what kind of demand you are seeing for standby kind of in the here now in July or any color you can provide sort of as the quarter progressed in terms of growth rates?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. So Ross I think your observation there is absolutely correct. I think there is a couple of things underlying that. I mean certainly the Q2 comp actually was a little bit easier than Q1. There was quite a bit of backlog demand we were fulfilling in the first quarter of '12 that made that quarter a little bit more difficult comp and that relaxed obviously we got to Q2 of 2012. But I look at the new initiatives that we have got that we have just rolled out here at the end of the year, the end of 2012 and in the first quarter with power play, with our AMP direct targeted marketing, we have got our national ad campaign now in market that started in late May, around the Memorial Day holiday, I think all of those things everything that we see on our dashboards as we look at the company and the KPIs we watch are telling us that closure rates are improving, lead generation is up significantly, web hits are up significantly. So interest level in the category home standby that is in particular which is the majority of that residential bucket is up significantly. We also had our power washers, that again this is our second full year in washers. So there is a little bit there in Q2 over the prior year Q2. So there is some pickup there which is good, we launched our OneWash product. So we are gaining share and there we are still small player, no question about it. But it continues to be a part of that overall growth for residential. Here and now we don't want to make comments about the current quarter. I think as we've said that we really have been impressed with the tail on this home standby business from Sandy. We think that the echo effect of Sandy happening in the same region as Irene a year before, has had a more substantial impact on the length of that tail, whereas we have said in the past we would expect to normally see an elevated period of demand for about 6 to maybe 12 months after event. I think we are going to see all of 12 months maybe longer with this event. So it will remain to be seen what happens as the season shapes up this year, but at least right now we really like the trajectory of that business.
Ross Gilardi – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: That's great guys. And then as you are seeing faster penetration or faster growth in portables, I mean what kind of opportunity do you see longer term for many of those consumers to upgrade to a standby product and are you seeing increasing incidence of that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, that's the beauty of it. I mean we look at our own data, when you look at home standby sales data and we look at the registration data underlying that and underpinning that, about half of the people who have a home standby or buy a home standby generator either own or own portable. So if we can give people a good experience, people kind of as a starter product if you will for backup power with a Generac branded portable generator, the upgrade path to a Generac branded home standby we believe is something that is an opportunity for us. And so the ability to market directly to those people now that we have that data it becomes a readymade kind of upgrade path marketing project for us and something that we are playing with right now in terms of how we can do that after people who have owned a portable generator a couple of years and maybe used it a few times, they understand that it's not a fully automatic solution, you do have refuel it often times it's inconvenient points in the middle of the evening, you have to have extension cords, you know the lack of automation on it and you got to be home when the power is out, you've got to be in an area that isn't so where the power outages are so wide spread that you can't even get fuel. So downside of using a portable generator are it works, but works in a pinch, and that's a great product. But the increased utility and value you get by spending little more money on a home standby is a great upgrade path and it's something we see as a great marketing opportunity for us as we have done very well in portable generators over the next few years, we think there could be good conversion rate opportunity there.
Ross Gilardi – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: And then you talked about inventory replenishment in the first half by the mass merchants but what did the mass merchants do in preparation for hurricane season? Do they build lot more safety stock this year and if there isn't a major outage event this summer, are you concerned at all that we have – that you'll only go through a big destocking event later in the second quarter?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, it's a good question Ross, just kind of two parts of the question. The first part I think that it's natural for retailers as they did last year after Irene to probably go heavier the season after a major event right. So they did after Irene, they stocked up really heavy for Sandy because they did I think we benefited from that. I think the stocking levels were main elevators, Sandy may be even have gone up a little bit more. If we look at our in-channel inventory where our partners have talked about their inventory levels and where they want to be for the season, it is somewhere higher than the prior year. Are we concerned about not getting storm? I think we put that into our guidance. Our guidance doesn't assume a major outage. It assumes there is no outage and as such would assume destocking would occur in the back half of the year as a result we built that into our guidance. The way we kind size ourselves around that and plan around that, it's pretty simple. We felt what's our everyday shop space in portable generators and then we kind of look at that, okay, if we didn't get in the event how long it will take us to burn that inventory off. And so we calibrate our own inventory levels as well as looking at those in the field and in channel and we create, we have a decision to we make there, we make some decisions about what could happen if we don't get a storm and I think you are seeing that reflected in the second half guidance as it relates to what we've issued this morning here.
Ross Gilardi – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I got you, thanks. That’s helpful. And then your dealer network is clearly growing very rapidly and you're citing that as a source of strength in the standby category. But is dealer inventory an increasingly important issued to follow talking obviously more about local electricians; do you have dealers that are building speculative inventory of standby product in front of the hurricane season? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: It's a good question I mean actually one that we have remarkable visibility to now given our activation data and things that we talk about on calls previously. There is no question that when you are look into certain regions of the countries, the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic we're seeing some dealers that are carrying inventory. The thing we're noticing now is that the demand has remained so strong that really every time they get inventory position the demand kind of is set up and so it's sold already. And when you are small dealer, what we said traditionally and what we can see here is there are some outlier dealers. Some of the larger dealers I think do take stock and positions as it's clear based on the data we see that's the case. And as dealers become bigger and we have more of them certainly field inventory becomes bigger every year as the category grows. But most dealers by and large of what we see these are small contractors, they don't have a lot of additional working capital and frankly not a lot of space to store 400 pound or 500 pound item, waiting betting on the come. And so what they do is often times they will not buy for mass until they've sold to a consumer. So they go and they do a consultation, an in-home consultation for a consumer or home owner. And then if the home owner chooses to accept their proposal, there is a permitting process. These are products it has to be – building permits has to be issued for electrical inspection test to be conducted. There is a lot of – there is some initial work upfront. They generally will not order for the product from us until they have that permit in hand because for them there is no reason to be out of pocket that working capital until they absolutely know they need to be.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott repressing Stifel. Please proceed. 
Stanley Elliott – Stifel Nicolaus: Good morning guys, thanks for taking my question. Question, as we're thinking about the power washer product, I mean I know it's relatively new but is it not – to think you guys couldn't get a 10% market share, something of that magnitude in another about two years down? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think Stanley think that's very reasonable goal for us. We're pushing people internally harder than that. I talked about we're calibrating that we want to be the number one provider in this space. I think it's an area where we have expertise based on our history we have expertise in terms of the manufacturing, in terms of the engineering, we have fantastic sourcing capabilities. These are engine-powered washers. So we're not in the electric washer space which would represent frankly about half of the market. So that's not a part of the market that we're going to address for the product line today. But on the gas washer side it is something that I think when you talk about share there, I think it's very reasonable to say 10% is something that's achievable for us.
Stanley Elliott – Stifel Nicolaus: Then as far as the discussions with the national accounts and I guess the line reviews have been ongoing. You had a big win last year, are you seeing any other sorts of big wins this coming season, for next year I guess rather.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, we are still in the season right now in terms of line of years, we are getting some indications back and there is some puts and takes there. And what we have heard so far, I think you know, we remain optimistic that we are going to have more wins, and we will have losses obviously as we roll out the product line. But it is a tough market. It is a competitive market, you've got to bring innovation to these accounts every year, year in and year out. You've got to be sharp on your costs, you've got to be sharp on your execution in terms of being able to meet their timelines, their rapid development cycles. Those are things that you know, we're developing competencies at the Company here. We've got elements of those competencies, we have more to develop but you know more to come as season kind of bears out here. And we have got more information in the months ahead.
Stanley Elliott – Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Then lastly, has there been any sort of improvement on regulatory environment, the FCC had they were some hearings I guess earlier this year, but is there any update of the status of that?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah I mean from all indications that we kind of see things from the outside looking in a little bit, we've got some ears to the ground obviously pretty aggressively in Washington DC where this is taking place. But everything we see is that with the change in the chairperson of FCC you know, that has put everything a little bit on the backburner as far as things, our priorities are potentially, you know, re-ordered going forward. It remains to be seen whether this will continue to be priority as it looks early on for the FCC. You know, I don't think there are anybody that can dispute there are more critical communications. You know, mobile voice and data communications that are going over wireless. That is the future of new LTE networks that are being rolled out very aggressively here by the carriers, you know, as well as the older networks that are vulnerable to power outages. We believe most of our customers have been very pro-active in that regard in addressing the areas of the country where they certainly have power quality issues, they are more prevalent. A more widespread regulatory approach to this could you know, obviously accelerate that for us, our business honestly and I say dramatically as one of the largest providers. But everything we heard right now, it is kind of everything is a little bit of a holding pattern till the FCC kind of figures out with the new chairperson what are the priorities are going to be going forward.
Stanley Elliott – Stifel Nicolaus: That's great. Well, thank you very much for your time and thanks a lot guys, great quarter. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Okay, thanks Stanley.
York Ragen: Thanks Stanley.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Tim Marooney] representing William Blair. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning Tim.
York Ragen: Good morning Tim.
Unidentified Analyst: I've got a couple of just real quick ones. First of all going back to the geographic question you've got, you've got all power inventories, Tower Light, after the close of Tower Light, what percent of your sales will be outside of the U.S. and what would be an ideal target that you look out over the next several years.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, I think we were saying about 10% to 15% of our sales would be outside the U.S. and Canada going forward, if you perform a Tower Light into the operations there. And obviously with the expectations for growth beyond that and whether that growth is organically through the acquisitions we've made through the introduction of new products and new customers and being part of a more larger entity like the Generac, the benefit that we can give these entities like Ottomotores, Tower Light in particular, you know the benefit in scale which is we think is you know potentially significant when you look at some things like Tower Light in particular, as I said before, the ability to offer additional products to Tower Light customers that they don't have today. We are very focused on a singular product line in light towers, but going forward you know right now about 10% to 15%, and we would expect to grow that even further, what is the comfortable position out there, you know, I don't think we quoted anything specific, but we like the opportunities that are ahead of us. There is a huge market worldwide for power generation for mobile equipment in particular. And so we think there is a lot of potential opportunity ahead of us.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. And lastly statement in your outlook statement you discussed an improved outlook in C&I shipments. Is that driven at all by an improved outlook for commercial construction market or is it more your infrastructure and telecom?
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think it is more the infrastructure and telecom piece here, but there is a piece here. We said we expected a little bit of improvement in the non-res construction indices here going forward. But frankly all indications are that still remains fairly soft off of obviously a very low base of the last several years. You know the rental companies as well as part of our C&I growth, so the national accounts there. They build out their fleets, we replenish their fleets and add a new product like mobile generators like I said we are getting some better traction there with our mobile generator line in those accounts. That's also a part of that C&I object that we are expecting in the second half.
Unidentified Analyst: Great thanks, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks Tim.
York Ragen: Thanks Tim.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the time we have for questions and answers. I would now like to turn the call back over to Aaron for any closing remarks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you. We really appreciate everybody's attention this morning for our second quarter call and we look forward to our third quarter call which should be sometime in the late October timeframe. Thanks again for your time this morning.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you, York. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report our first quarter 2013 results this morning, which we believe continue to demonstrate the accelerated adoption of standby generators into the residential and commercial markets. The awareness for the need for backup power has steadily increased over the last several years as power outages have occurred more frequently and for longer period of time. With our sales marketing and distribution efforts in our superior operational execution we have quickly build Generac into a very powerful brand in the emerging market for residential and commercial standby generators. Our first quarter net sales increased 36% over the prior year to a record $400 million with strong organic growth of 29% which remain broad based across all major regions in the United States. This strong organic growth is even more impressive when considering as follows the first, the prior year first quarter in which net sales more than doubled over the first quarter of 2011. We converted these record shipment levels during the first quarter of 2013 into record levels of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Growth in shipments of home standby generators were again very strong during the quarter as the market for these products has further developed with more home owners becoming aware of the importance of having a backup power system. With penetration rates at less than 3% of single family unattached homes in the U.S. we believe there remains a substantial opportunity to continue to grow the market for these products. As the leader in the home standby generator category over the last decade with approximately 70% of market share our efforts remain focused on driving growth for this emerging product category. When combining the elevated awareness for major power outage events in recent years along with our AMP targeted marketing process power play in-home selling solution and efforts to expand distribution we believe we can continue to drive demand for home standby generators going forward. In addition to increased home standby sales during the first quarter of 2013 we also experienced a substantial year-over-year increase in portable generator shipments to the combination of inventory replenishment and overall expanded placement for these products at our retail customers. In a relatively short period of time since we entering this product category we have leveraged our technical knowledge, manufacturing capabilities and our distribution relationships to build a leading share in the portable generator market. In doing so we have further positioned the Generac brand is representing quality innovative products to provide the reliability and durability that our customers demand. Building on our success in portable generators we set out to reenter the engine driven power washer market last year. Through our technical expertise in air-cooled engines and detailed customer research we have developed a full line of washers, which includes the industry’s only variable speed power washer that we can OneWash. We recently launched this innovative new product for the spring selling season and have received positive initial feedback from both retailers and consumers. With the successful first quarter rollout of OneWash and increased placement of our consumer and prosumer units at our retail channel partners we believe we are making good progress in taking share in the power washer product category. In addition to executing on the significant increase and demand for residential products the first full quarter the Ottomotores has also contributed to our year-over-year sales growth. Our progress to-date with the integration of both the Mexico and Brazil operations has been favorable as we work toward realizing the potential revenue and cost synergies. Although we are still early in the integration process the Generac and Ottomotores sales and marketing teams remain excited about the potential to sell our residential and light commercial standby generators and mobile power equipment in the Latin American market. Much of the cost savings we are projecting will come primarily as a result of increased purchasing scale with certain components and commodities as well as from improved utilization and efficiencies in the Ottomotores operations. We remain on track to begin realizing savings of approximately $2 million a year on an annualized basis towards the second half of 2013 with the potential for additional cost reductions during the second full year of ownership. Demand for our Generac brand commercial and industrial stationery generators continues to see positive momentum during the increased awareness of the need for backup power on the part of businesses. In particular we experience strong shipments of light commercial generators used in smaller footprint retail applications as the market interest in cleaner burning more cost effective natural gas fueled backup generators continues to increase as a result of the exceptional value proposition of these products. Additionally we saw revenue growth from our telecom national account customers as wireless providers look to further safeguard their networks from power outages. Our strong results have generated over $210 million of free cash flow over the 12 months ending March 31st 2013. Our attractive margins, capital efficient business model and favorable tax attributes are the drivers of our significant cash flows which we believe sets us apart from any of our peers. This strong cash flow generation has allowed us to pursue several shareholder value enhancing activities. In recent years we’ve invested heavily in the infrastructure of our business to support and drive organic growth which has been the primary factor in doubling the size of Generac. In addition to investing in our organic growth over the past two years we’ve also paid down approximately $200 million of debt closed on acquisitions totaling a $130 million and paid a $6 per share special dividend. We believe all of these investments have helped to drive significant value for our shareholders with our market capitalization increasing by over $1.3 billion over this time period. As we continue to focus on driving shareholder value we are pleased this morning to announce for a second consecutive year that Generac would be paying a special cash dividend to its shareholders of up to $5 per share. As part of this proposed special cash dividend, we plan to refinance our existing credit facility and incur subject to market and other conditions approximately $335 million of additional debt. The new $1.15 billion credit facility is expected to be priced approximately 200 basis points or more below our current credit facility and will be slightly accretive to our earnings per share on run rate basis. We are confident that this new capital structure will provide us with the flexibility to further invest in organic growth initiative as well as pursue acquisitions that fit our Powering Ahead strategy. Given our performance and significant cash generation coupled with a very robust credit market today we believe this transaction represents yet another attractive return of capital to Generac shareholders. I would now like to turn the call back over to York to discuss first quarter results in more detail. York?
York Ragen: Thanks Aaron. As Aaron previously mentioned net sales for the first quarter 2013 were $399.6 million a 35.7% increase as compared to $294.6 million in the first quarter of 2012. Looking at net sales by product class residential product sales increased 45.8% to $255.2 million in the first quarter of 2013 relative to a strong prior year net sales comparison of $175.1 million which saw a year-over-year sales growth of 153% over the first quarter of 2011. The growth from the current year was broad based primarily driven by a significant increase in demand for standby and portable generators. With regard to home standby generators the combination of strong incoming orders and increased production rates which drove shorter lead times during the quarter considered the record shipment levels of home standby generators. Awareness for home standby generators remains high as a result of the afterglow for major power outages over the last couple of years. As demand has significantly increased over the last several quarters we’ve been able to quickly expand our capacity and supply chain enabling us to execute and satisfy our customers. Portable generator shipments during the first quarter 2013 were up significantly in comparison to the prior year quarter. Our broad relationships at retail provide us with expanded placement for portable generators over the last several years. As a result we have seen strength and shipment for these products due to strong inventory replenishment and sell through at retail after major power outages in recent quarter. We believe our solid execution and working capital investments have allowed us to capture a leading share of the portable generator market further enhancing our leading position in the market for residential backup power in the U.S. Also contributing to the revenue growth for residential products during the first quarter of 2013 was increased revenue from our power washer product line including an encouraging start to sales of our new One-Wash product which began loading on retail shelves during the quarter. We also continue to see attractive revenue growth from our Honeywell licensed residential product that are targeted toward penetrating the HVAC distribution channel. Looking at our commercial and industrial products net sales increased 21% to $127.1 million in the first quarter of 2013 from $105 million in the first quarter of 2012. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the Ottomotores acquisition. This is the first full quarter of including Ottomotores in our financial results and we are excited about the international expansion opportunities as the Ottomotores businesses will provide us throughout Latin America. Also contributing to the year-over-year growth for strong shipments to telecom national customers as well as increased sales of light commercial natural gas generators is in smaller retail applications. As more businesses are affected by power outages we are seeing increased penetration in the commercial market for backup power as companies look to protect their reputation, inventories and revenue streams. These increases were slightly offset by a difficult prior year comparison during the quarter for certain of our mobile product sold through national rental accounts. Our other product sales category improved to $17.2 million in the first quarter of 2013 an increase of 19.2% from prior year first quarter sales of $14.5 million. As a reminder this product category is mostly comprised of aftermarket service parts as well as loose engine sold directly to OEMs for using engine power products across a wide range of applications. Gross margin as a percent of sales for the first quarter of 2013 was 38.4% compared to 37.7% in the prior year first quarter. The 70 basis point improvement was primarily the result of increased cost reduction efforts, improved pricing and a moderation in commodity cost. These margin improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from the addition of Ottomotores sales. Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2013 increased $5.4 million or 10.5% as compared to the prior year first quarter. This increase was primarily driven by operating expenses associated with the Ottomotores business as well as increased sales, engineering and administrative infrastructure to support the strategic growth initiatives and higher base line sale level of the company. Partially offsetting these increases was a $6 million decline in the amortization of intangibles. Excluding the impact of non-cash intangible amortization expense operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during the first quarter 2013 was 12.7% representing a 60 basis point decline as compared to 13.3% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 43.5% to $108.8 million a 27.2% of net sales in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to $75.8 million a 25.7% of net sales in the same period last year. Our attractive EBITDA margins improved by 150 basis points in the current year quarter primarily as a result of our material cost reductions and leveraging our SG&A infrastructure on the higher organic shipment volumes. Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months as of March 31, 2013 was $322.8 million or 25.2% of net sales during that period. GAAP net income for the first quarter 2013 was $50.7 million as compared to $30.1 million for the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted net income as defined in our earnings release increased 26.9% to $83.9 million in the current year quarter versus $66.1 million in the prior year first quarter. This increase was attributable to improve the operating earnings during the quarter resulting from the 35.7% increase in net sales partially offset by the higher interest expense due to the refinancing of the company’s credit facilities in May of 2012 as well as higher cash income taxes. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.73 in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $0.44 per share in the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconciled in our earnings release was $1.21 for the current year quarter compared to $0.96 per share in the prior year quarter a 26% year-over-year increase. The current year adjusted EPS figure include the $0.20 per share headwind from the combination of higher interest expense and to a lesser extent higher cash income taxes. With regards to cash income taxes the first quarter 2013 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of $4.5 million as compared to only 55,000 in the prior year quarter which translates into a $0.06 per share impact to adjusted EPS. As we commented during our previous conference call our cash income taxes for 2013 are expected to increase going forward due to a combination of our NOL carry forward becoming fully utilized during 2013 and higher overall profitability levels. Cash income taxes for 2013 were previously estimated to be approximately $9 million to $10 million. Based on our increasing guidance for the full year 2013 cash income tax expenses now projected to be $14 million to $15 million for the year which translates into a cash income tax rate of 6% to 7%. Importantly our favorable tax yield through annual intangible asset amortization in our tax return remains intact through 2021 resulting in approximately $49 million of cash tax savings per year for the next nine years. As a result our cash income tax rate is expected to be significantly lower than our current projected 37% to 39% GAAP income tax rate for the foreseeable future. As we drive higher profitability over time and the incremental pre-tax profit over this tax yield would be taxed as projected 37% to 39% tax rate going forward. Free cash flow defined as our net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $33.9 million in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to $36.4 million in the same period last year. Strong operating earnings were partially offset by increased working capital investments driven by higher levels of accounts receivable from record levels of shipments during the quarter as well as the replenishment of inventory levels to support higher production rates and seasonal bill requirements. Free cash flow over the past 12 months was $210.7 million representative of our very strong free cash flow conversion. As we announced today the company is pursuing a recapitalization to fund a special cash dividend to shareholders. Historically we have demonstrated the ability to pay down debt through our strong free cash flow generation with a recent example being the prepayment of $110 million of debt thus far in 2013 which includes the $30 million payment of the debt made this week. Going back to March 31, 2013 we have total debt outstanding of $813.2 million net of unamortized original issue discount. Total consolidated cash and cash equivalence at the end of the quarter was $54.3 million resulting in consolidated net debt of $758.9 million and a consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.4 times as of March 31, 2013. This compares to a 3.5 times ratio at June 30, 2012, which reflected the $6 per share special dividend recapitalization in the second quarter of last year. For the special dividend that we are contemplating this year, we intend to incur subjective to market and other conditions approximately $335 million of additional debt as compared to March 31, 2013 (to fund) in large part a special cash dividend of up to $5 per share on our outstanding common stock. As part of this transaction, we expect to amend and restate our existing credit facility and upside to an aggregate amount of approximately $1.15 billion at an interest rate that is approximately 200 basis points or more or lower than our current credit facility. Again this should be slightly accretive to adjusted earnings per share compared to the current run rate. The proceeds from the amended debt financing will be used to pay the special cash dividend and to refinancing our existing credit facilities. We expect our current $150 million unfunded revolver will remain in place and be extended for another year. The declaration of the special cash dividend is conditioned upon obtaining new debt financing under acceptable terms. We currently expect our Board of Directors will declare an authorized payment of a special cash dividend before the end of the second quarter of 2013. Again given our strong free cash flow profile and availability on our undrawn $150 million revolving credit facility, we are very comfortable that we can still pursue our growth initiatives, while continuing to de-lever over time. Following the dividend recapitalization, we will continue to prioritize our cash flows towards making investments to drive the organic growth of the company, paying down debt to our targeted two to three times gross debt leverage ratio and executing on discipline, strategic acquisitions that we have in our pipeline. With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide additional comments on our outlook for 2013.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you, York. As a result of continued strong demand for our products, we are raising our sales guidance for full year 2013. Full year 2013 net sales are now expected to increase in the low to mid teens range over the prior year as compared to the approximately 10% sales increase previously expected. Specifically for the second quarter of 2013, net sales are forecasted to increase between 30% and 35% in comparison to the second quarter of 2012. This top line guidance continues to assume no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment and no major power outage events for the remainder of 2013. We expect the demand for home standby generators will continue to benefit from increased awareness as a result of the major power outage event that have occurred in recent years resulting in a new and higher baseline level of demand for these products. In addition, we believe the ongoing improvement in the environment for residential investment and execution on our initiatives will further drive home standby penetration rates. As our guidance for the remainder of the year does not include any assumptions from major power outages, we expect to see a year-over-year decline in shipments of portable generators although not to the magnitude previously expected. For comparative purposes, when excluding the impact of event driven portable generator sales in 2012, we are projecting total residential product shipments for 2013 increased in the high single-digit range over the prior year as a result of continued demand for home standby generators and increased placement of power washers. We continue to expect net sales for commercial and industrial products to increase at a low 30% year-over-year growth rate for 2013 through a combination of the Ottomotores acquisition as well as high single-digit organic growth for both stationary and mobile power equipment. Our outlook for C&I products continues to assume a modestly improved non-residential construction market in 2013 over the prior year. Summarizing our sales growth assumptions for full year 2013, total company organic year-over-year growth excluding the impact of engine driven portables from 2012 is not expected to be between 8% and 10%, which represents an increase from our previous guidance of 6% to 8%. Assuming no major outages for the remainder of 2013, this organic growth is now expected to be partially offset by an approximate 3% headwind from a decline in portable generator sales. The acquisition of Ottomotores is still expected to contribute between 7% to 9% growth for total expected year-over-year net sales increase in the low to mid teens range. In addition as discussed during our last call, based on our historical experience a major outage event could provide an incremental net sales of between $20 million and $50 million representing the potential for 2% to 4% additional growth to our forecast depending on several factors. Consolidated gross margins for 2013 are now expected to be flat as compared to the prior year, which represents an improvement from our previous outlook of a decline in gross margins of between 80 to 100 basis points. This significantly improved forecast for gross margins is primarily due to the greater impact of cost reductions and further moderation in commodity costs along with a slight improvement in product mix. Given this outlook, we expect full year margins of approximately 37% for the third year in a row, as we continue to diversify and globalize our business. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding amortization of intangibles are still expected to be slightly up compared to 2012 as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our various strategic growth initiatives and an overall higher level of baseline sales. As a result, of the higher sales outlook and the revised margin guidance we now expect adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2013 to increase in the low-teens percentage range over the prior year which is higher than the mid single-digit percentage range previously expected. We expect cash flow conversion to remain strong during 2013 and to be consistent with the cumulative average during the past four years of free cash flow representing between 90% to 95% of our adjusted net income. In closing this morning we believe our first quarter results clearly provide another tangible example of the significant earning power of our business model. The powerful macro drivers for Generac including the under investment of the electrical grid and aging in more electrically dependent population and more severe and unpredictable whether it should drive further awareness of the need for backup power. In addition to these macro drivers we continue to work on a number of exciting strategic initiatives that we believe will further grow the baseline business for Generac over the long-term. Through innovation and solid execution in 2013, we expect to drive the adoption of backup power generation for homes and businesses. At the same time we are building Generac into a larger more balanced company with improved global focus by continuing to diversity our product offerings our distribution channels and the geographies we serve. Add to this potential for further recovery in residential investment and non residential construction and we believe Generac is well positioned over the long term to continue driving organic revenue growth superior margins and strong free cash flow. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time we’d like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, your Q&A session will now begin. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Over to you Christopher.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good morning. So just curious if you look at the 2Q guidance we look at that as indicative of the new baseline or does that factor and still a partial lingering of afterglow from the events?
York Ragen: Yeah, this is York. I mean I think there is probably some afterglow I think we’ve – when you talk about lead-times and as we ramped up production here into – in the first quarter we came into the year with lead-times elevated as a result of strong demand from Sandy it was about probably 8 to 10 weeks when we came into the year we ramped up production very quickly very efficiently, by the end of the quarter coming into second quarter probably lead-times are probably more three or four weeks and then now probably today they’re probably more in line with normal lead-times around two weeks I think as a result of that there’s probably some lead-time contraction in Q2, having said that then there is the baseline levels from a seasonality perspective that underlay that one.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Okay. And then in terms of a overall penetration the product category that you’ve been talking about 2.5% or so. Could you comment on the relative penetration for homes 100,000 or 200,000 versus maybe higher value tranches.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, I mean it’s a great question Chris. The penetration rates we’ve always been amazed when you look at penetration rates and we look at kind of a – we spread the sales if you will for homes standby generators across a wide range of demographics each group’s home values. What we see is the very even distribution so first of all just to clarify the penetration rate we say now is little less than 3% and that just to remind everybody the addressable market as we define it is single family unattached housing stock in the U.S. greater than a $100,000 in value so we really – well some of these products probably end up on homes less than a $100,000 in value the majority of them are greater than that. And when you look at specifically to answer your question tranches like the 100 to 200K range what we find is actually a pretty even distribution certainly further up the home price gets as a percentage of that homes value the investment in homes standby generator become smaller. So obviously it becomes an easier project to undertake from a financial standpoint for homes of greater value not just the general statement but that being said what we see is in particular in areas of the country we have older housing stock which is in the Northeast, some areas in the Midwest where you have demographically speaking we have older customers who have been in this homes for a long time. The home value themselves are not that great in fact when you look at it there is actually a pretty even spread homes under $300,000 represent a little less than half of the total installed base and that’s probably a little bit of a dated figure about a year or two old but and about a half of it is over $300,000 so just to give you some perspective in terms of how that breaks out.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Great. Thanks and congratulations.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you Chris.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Over to you Jeff.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hey, good morning guys. Can you quantify what Ottomotores was in the quarter?
Unidentified Company Representative: It – we haven’t broken out specifically but it was the vast majority of the year-over-year growth that 21% year-over-year growth for C&I the vast majority of that was Ottomotores, we did see a positive organic growth on the Generac side but Ottomotores has made up the vast majority of that 21%.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Just in general what do you’re seeing in the commercial around attitudes on commercial generators on the East Coast just given the level of storms and just kind of change in attitude from your kind of key customers and cellphone backup power, gas stations etcetera. And are you seeing kind of any movement on rags being put in place there.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah Jeff, its Aaron. We’ve seen obviously an elevated interest in commercial gensets we call that out as one bright spot in Q1 and frankly we’ve been calling that out as a bright spot over the last several years here in terms of the value proposition that in particular the smaller footprint retailers get from having a small backup system in particular we’ve seen a tendency towards small natural gas systems because the front-end cost is lower on those machines. As it relates to regulations in a particular certain verticals in businesses we obviously telecommunications we’ve been a longstanding supplier to that industry, we continue to see a lot of interest in that vertical in particular. We’ve now seen stepped up interest is the matter of fact not only from the telecommunications providers themselves but the co-locators also so these are some of the companies that co-locate space for towers where the wireless company itself does not want to either own the real estate or physically can on the real estate or for whatever reason doesn’t the co-locators and there is a few of them out there have gotten interest in this category in the last few years because they’re offering backup power on those sites. Basically is another amenity if you will for the carriers to entice them to choose one co-locator versus another one of their peers and so we’re seeing more interest there around regulation the FCC had shown some pretty strong interest early on in tackling these issue of critical communications that don’t occur when you have power outages we have this notion that we want to send everybody a text message when a Tornado is coming or send everybody text messages to get out of the way of the path of severe weather that’s a great idea and everybody carries their mobile phone, the problem is that the tower site is darks as a result of that – as a result of the outage from that weather you don’t get the message though. So if lenders those kind of first alert systems really been renders and useless so that’s an issue. The other issue is just critical communications 911 calls lot of people are cutting the landline to their homes and they’re using cellphones now exclusively and that creates a problem obviously at the local self site doesn’t have power. So the SEC started to tackle this issue I think there is been obviously there is a new Chair person coming in for the FCC so we’ll see the outgoing Chair person had some interest in it we’ll see up the new Chair person wants to take that up as a area. We’ve actually seen actually more interest at the local and state level than we have at the federal level around gas stations the whole fuel infrastructure discussion as gotten some legs here in terms of certain townships and certain local entities actually mandating at least some level of readiness for critical fuel depots or critical fuel stations, some of them are readiness to connect the generator which is good but the logistics get pretty tough in the middle of the storm to find a generator to hook up to that installation. So we still think the right answer is a permanently install backup generator for critical installations, critical communications, critical infrastructure, we think that’s a right answer, we do think that over time regulations will move in that direction we just don’t know which at what speed.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And then just overall on margins what’s driving the better margins just simply better flow through on volumes or are you getting any kind of better mix shift?
York Ragen: Actually Jeff, its York. Actually I think the bigger, you are talking Q1 specifically year-over-year gross margins 70 basis point improvement. The mix actually wasn’t a huge component of that because if you remember last year at this time, we were in similar pattern, as we just come off a significant outages and we’re shipping a lot of home standby generators in Q1 of 2012 we did that in Q1 of 2013 as well. I think when you look at the cost reduction efforts that we’ve been working on where just it’s part of our culture and just we are relentless on value engineering, our strategic global sourcing group is woks tirelessly discover the globe to find the best quality lowest price components. And then, when you think about Magnum, the things that we’re working with the Magnum Group to go after cost reductions in a way in the Generac way. All those things are what’s happening behind the scenes to dive the improvement in margins that we are talking about. When you talk about, I mentioned in the and actually in the release, I mentioned pricing when you are the step of volumes you don’t any promotional discounting you don’t need to do and those are the big drivers. I think commodity moderation is playing a role – a bit of a role here. But I think when you put that all together you are getting to 70 basis point improvement and that’s and that’s even in spite of the Ottomotores business for the first quarter layering on which has traditional industrial and international type margins that are layering on top of that so all good things on the margin front.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi. Over to you, Ross.
Ross Gilardi – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Good morning.
York Ragen: Good morning, Ross.
Ross Gilardi – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I’m just wondering, what’s happening with installation costs around the country? I know, you are seeing as more electricians are getting trained and learn about your products and start more businesses just dedicated to installing generators are you seeing installation costs start to go down to reduce the overall total cost for the customer?
York Ragen: Yeah Ross that’s an area of focus for us over the years. We have always said that, we can work – we can work tirelessly here at Generac to take cost out of the product. We can take a $100 of cost out of the product and that’s a lot of work to take $100 of cost out of a product. And yet if our installation partners, just turnaround put 100 bucks back in installation or overcharge for installation, we’re not getting the kind of traction we need for the TCO, the total cost of ownership of the product. So, we’ve been focused on this issue. What we haven’t had is enough data to do something about it and that – that sounds like a bit of a (inaudible) but it’s true. I mean, if pricing go over the map, installations are, we wish there was kind of a one size fits all approach to installations. But if you are installing a product in a 100 year farm house versus new construction those installation the spreads on those, the cost of those different installations is pretty wide. But what we’ve done is, if you recall, we launched now this new selling system that we got we call it power play, the tablet based selling solution, which allows our distributions, our dealers, which we got now over 5000 dealers here as of the end of Q1 and it allows those dealers to quickly produce a proposal and it’s a turnkey proposal for homeowners. Well in doing so, it includes the installation cost and a fairly detailed breakdown of the installation cost between materials and labor and all of the aspects of permits and things that go into that. We have a very rich stream of data suddenly coming at us relatively to installation costs. It’s our goal this year to collect that data to mind that data and to start to create different programs around that. I can’t say that just from a step back, just a big macro standpoint to answer your question yes, we’re seeing some higher competition on installations as more people have been trained how to do it as more dealers come online and as interested increase in the category and dealers have to get a bit sharper with their pencil on a total cost proposal basis. But yet I think that there are still some fairly decent breakthroughs to be had in installation costs, which we’ve not yet realized in the market. I think our ability to collect that data mine it and to find insight in it to help us either design product modifications to take cost out of the installation, which we’ve done a little bit over the years here or to improve training or frankly to exert some amount of additional control or pressure over what the installed costs are being charged on the marketplace. I think that’s the more exciting thing. It’s a little bit more, longer term-view but I do think that’s going to be, that’s going to be something that we’re looking forward to kind of 2014 and beyond.
Ross Gilardi – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks a lot. And then, what are seeing in the rental channel right now. You said that I think part of Magnum I’m not sure it was part of Magnum or all of Magnum was actually down due to tough comps. Do you think that the rental companies being more cautious on fleet, is there any competitive issue there at all or are you any less excited about Magnum going forward anywhere three to six months ago?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. We remain really excited about that business. What we find it’s interesting that’s a business that we’re learning over the last really kind of year and a half of our ownership here. The national account part of that business is a pretty heavy weight on that business in terms of the amount of sales. And very similar to our national account business and our C&I, our C&I segment that is, it can be a bit lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. There is a degree of variability. And so, we think that this is just kind of that, that kind of nature of from one quarter to the next, seeing a bit of variability there in the national account purchases. We really like the long-term prospects for this business. When you look at what it targets in terms of the infrastructure build out in the U.S. road construction, commercial construction, oil and gas, which did pull back a bit. I think, you could admit maybe there is a bit softness there on the oil and gas side but I think that also it’s a fairly temporary phenomenon. Natural gas production, oil production in this country domestic energy production is going to be important center for us over the next couple of decades here in this country. And so, we think that the, we’re in a really good spot with this business. We like the opportunities for this business internationally. They don’t have much in the way of international sales. So, we think there is some opportunities there as well going forward. So, we think that there is no share loss sin these numbers. It’s really just I think some variability quarter-to-quarter.
Ross Gilardi – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. And then just lastly, could you just talk a little bit more about your initial read on Ottomotores and Brazilian markets receptivity to the products and does it whet your appetite to want to diversify further globally with acquisitions?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. The Ottomotores acquisition has really been for us, it’s been a great experience as a company that’s been frankly very focused domestically here in the U.S. and Canada for the last 50 plus years getting ourselves down on the ground in another country and other countries in this case all of Latin America including Brazil, Mexico. And really starting to understand – create an understanding for those other markets, how those markets transact distribution not only philosophies, but tendencies how customers order all the things that come with learning a new business. We are pretty quick studies here. So, we pick this up, we think pretty quickly. There is frankly that business has a lot of opportunity and Brazil in particular that’s a very, obviously it’s a very kind of protectionist economy the way that it’s structured with having a physical presence in the country we think that there is some opportunity there. The Ottomotores it’s still relatively new down there. They have only been there for a couple of years. The previous owner had started up that branch, that business Ottomotores Brazil several years ago and they are still pretty small so we like what we see there in terms of potential demand around world – the World Cup infrastructure build out around the Summer Olympics in Rio that build out. We think the next several years here are pretty exciting. As far as whetting our appetite for further acquisitions as we’ve indicated part of our Powering Ahead strategy is to be a more global company. We believe that there is a substantial opportunity for Generac to be much bigger on the global scene in terms of a player in the markets that we serve the products in particular around Nat gas, which again is a pretty nascent market globally. It’s growing in North America but it’s still pretty small in other parts of the world but I think natural gas is going to be an area of intense focus, natural gas production, natural gas utilization now in gensets but base load power creation is going to be and transportation potentially is going to be a very solid focus worldwide here for the next several decades. And so, I think, we’re going to be really focused on finding additional opportunities to grow globally and that could be organically in certain areas. It could be through acquisition. I guess, we’ll evaluate one of those opportunities as they come along but we’re pretty excited about the potential for Generac and becoming a much more global player. 
Ross Gilardi – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Outstanding. Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Ross.
York Ragen: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Charley Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Over to you Charley.
Charley Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning Charley.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi, Charley.
Charley Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Perhaps if I misjudged, did you guys give what how much portables and how much standbys were opt in the quarter?
Unidentified Company Representative: No, we…
Unidentified Company Representative: We don’t break that out traditionally.
Unidentified Company Representative: We have not traditionally broken that out but I think what we did say is that both contributed to growth and we saw a very nice growth on both sides of – both of those product lines.
Charley Brady – BMO Capital Markets: And then on the OneWash product how many stores is that in right now and what’s the rollout look like for that product?
Unidentified Company Representative: I don’t have the total store count Charley directly on hand but I – we got a – we’ve got an innovation MCAP as it referred to at Low’s in all stores. So and it’s the entire store count of Lows. We’ve got some other partners in the retail side so its, I mean, it’s in thousands of locations put it that way. I don’t have again don’t have the exact store count so I apologize for that but good receptivity on that product initially here both at the retail channel as well as consumer channel. I think pursuant to comments made by others in the Lawn & Garden market the spring has been I know here in the Upper Midwest up until really the last few days you wouldn’t want to be in outside doing anything and I think I saw it was smelling again in Minnesota yesterday. So there is parts of the country here where spring just has not arrived or is only recently arrived. So we’re actually pretty encouraged by the performance of OneWash and frankly our other consumer and power washers at this point in spite of a slow start to the spring season. So we’re hoping to see that accelerate even more here, I will say that lot of the OneWash today is placement its initial rollout into these stores so we’ll be monitoring very closely over the next 30 to 60 days as kind of a sell-through at retail and again we hope to see spring kind of arrive in parts of the country where it has yet to arrive.
Charley Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. It’s fair to say that the bulk of the rollout initial placement is completed.
Unidentified Company Representative: A good chunk of that initial rollout has been completed here through April so not fully reflected in Q1 there is some additional that rollout was kind of bridging over really March and April and there is a little bit actually here in May as well but the bulk of it’s done.
Charley Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And in terms of pricing I know you talked about mix really being or not being a big driver of it in cost containment being above I’m wondering can you quantify how much if any price to help the margins?
Unidentified Company Representative: Price was a small piece of that although.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, I mean we did…
Unidentified Company Representative: Now it looks sellers that was this deliver.
Unidentified Company Representative: We didn’t raise prices in our residential markets this year, we adjusted prices only slightly in our C&I markets on certain note so I think in the totality and that frankly we wouldn’t be realizing much of that yet anyway in C&I because there is a lag in terms of the court order to shift cycle so that’s something that it was a very small contributor in the quarter.
Charley Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And one more, I’ll back in the queue. Your comment on the special dividend when you said up to $5 I’m just trying to understand the up two part what’s – is that continues on the size of the financing as it sound like a size of financing was pretty fixed.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, this – yeah we’ve got – similar to what we did last year, Charley we set up to at that point $10 we were looking at and then we went out and restructure that deal even though the financing was – we had a pretty good plan on what we wanted to do the high yield markets were not as receptive we kind of hit a soft patch in high yield market frankly when we launched last year and so we downsized the dividend to $6. So this year should market conditions dictate I think the important thing to note as we said last year is we really don’t have a gun to your head have to do anything I mean is this kind of an optional transaction for us that we think is not only accretive as we said even though on slight basis to our run rate EPS but it just we think it’s a great way to return capital on the evidence of free cash flow of this company to our shareholders but again if the markets tighten up for some reason if there is something in Europe or something in who knows some other parts of the world that gets people generally in terms of the debt markets to credit markets we could downsize that if we needed to there is really no need to do the transaction other than that we think it’s just a smart financial move for us.
Charley Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Great. Thanks a lot.
Unidentified Company Representative: That market we’re strong but it should be out in the next week or two just a disclaimer.
Charley Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Yeah. Fair enough.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks Charley.
Charley Brady – BMO Capital Markets: Thanks.
Operator: Thanks for your question. Next question comes from the line of Brian Drab of William Blair. Over to you.
Brian Drab – William Blair: Good morning York. Good morning Aaron.
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning.
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning. Brian, how are you?
Brian Drab – William Blair: Good, good. Obviously the entire Generac teams have been working at an amazing record pace for the last six months in large part (inaudible) need on the East Coast so congrats on what you guys have accomplished.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you.
Brian Drab – William Blair: Can you talk a little bit more about the order rates in general whether activity that you are seeing on the East Coast and what’s the trends in throughout the first quarter and if you could comment how is the activity been in April?
Unidentified Company Representative: Sure. I think we typically don’t get too detail in those descriptions Brian but I think I can tell you just couple of high levels things. As I said I may have mentioned it in answering the previous question our dealer account is now over 5000 dealers at the end of the first quarter which is obviously a bigger number than it was I think we were at something on the order of 4800 at the end of the year. So we’ve added that’s a pretty brisk phase to continue to add distribution so you can take that as to mean there is still a high level of interest certainly at the distribution level around these products. Consumer level now that we’ve got some frankly some pretty good information coming out of us with our as I mentioned our power play application, our AMP targeted marketing process. The information flow that we’re getting is frankly it’s starting to be a tidal wave of data that we’ve had – we’ve always been a very data driven organization we’re getting even more data now at a much more granular level both geographically breakdowns of profit margins for dealers and installation cost and really that’s helping us kind of refine our marketing methods our targeted marketing approach in terms of geographically where we’re going. We see obviously in the Northeast as you indicate still a fair amount of interest in the category we just hit the six month anniversary for Sandy here beginning of the week, we think that, that interest is going to stay fairly strong throughout the next couple of quarters. As we’ve said when you get a large event like that, that afterglow as we referred to it can be anywhere from 6 to 12 months. Certainly in the Northeast there is a compounding effect with the Irene event that happened in 2011 and there is just some areas in that country that have been battered by these events and power outages have been very prevalent and have caused people to reevaluate their needs and those needs now are starting to include backup power. On top of that you got housing increasing and well new constructions not a huge part of where these products go it’s still 10% to 15% of our sales so movements up to the kinds of levels for new construction do have some kind of an impact there that’s positive. I do think my comments aside about the Northeast we’ve actually seen strength in all regions so that’s what gives us again we talk about events and we talk about the impact those events have really the impact that those events have as it gives us the opportunity to tell our story to everybody and regardless if you live in California or you live in New Jersey or you live somewhere in the Midwest or Southeast we get to tell people about the category we get to educate people, we get to invest in our infrastructure to promote the category, we get to invest in our infrastructure to market the category and I think that’s the most to me that’s the – when we talk about this new higher baseline that it couldn’t be more evidence for that and to see all of the regions performing well in this category.
Brian Drab – William Blair: Okay, great. Thanks for all that detail. And just if you could talk just a little bit more about the Sandy effect when I think about the typical person who is affected by Sandy I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s something that a standby generators something that they consider throughout the winter talk to the dealer now the weather is breaking now you’re going to start to see the installation if you been at – why don’t – but it doesn’t work that way where we see actually even stronger sales or standby generators now that the weather is breaking.
Unidentified Company Representative: Well I think there is a couple of things, first of all obviously demand surged in near-term months right after the event right so through the fourth quarter we saw a very good demand through the first quarter kind of above our historical levels of demand certainly for that category and it continues here in going into the second quarter, obviously as it warms up in certain parts of the country installations become easier to do so there is a physically there is some constraints installing when the ground is frozen in certain areas trenching for gas pipe and electrical runs if that’s required in certain installation that’s tougher to do in the date of winter so installations have certainly picked up as we – as York mentioned couple of times we ramped up our production pretty aggressively in Q1 and into Q2 here we’ve gotten our lead-times down to at the end of the first quarter we were down to about three or four weeks and that’s down now back inside of normal lead-times here as we stand today. The interest level remains high and I think it will remain high as I said for the next couple of quarters the thing it run into is that the further you get away from a major event even though people may be good to consideration immediately after and they maybe good research they maybe talked to a dealer, dealers were busy, product was not as available. And so they probably put off maybe another event to trigger them to kept them over the point of purchase. Some people are lot more proactive and they will get back in the queue right way here. As season (warms up) they are going to – they will read something about the anniversary of Sandy or the experience of thunderstorm locally. It takes up power or they will hear a story about power being cut to some part of the country or and that will remind them that they remain vulnerable without a backup power system. So, again there is a lot of different factors that go into that. It’s an emotional thing for people. It’s a practical thing for certain others, who have businesses they run in other homes or medical devices they are running. But for people where it’s more of a discretionary purchase sometimes it takes a couple of outages to put them over the edge.
Brian Drab – William Blair: Right, right. Okay. Thanks for all the detail.
York Ragen: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Over to you.
Steve Tusa – JPMorgan: Sorry my questions have been answered. Thanks.
York Ragen: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of John Quealy of Canaccord. Over to you.
John Quealy – Canaccord: Hey good morning guys. Congrats on the quarter.
York Ragen: Hi, John.
John Quealy – Canaccord: Can we go to play – can we go to power play for a minute. I know it was rolled out in the iPad I think January at your sales conference. Can you talk about are closure rates better for the population that has this application in the field is time to close better. Just anecdotally, can you give us some feeling on how that’s rolling out in the ground level with the guys?
York Ragen: It’s a great question John and the one that we’ve been watching this very closely because obviously we want to, we want to see the impact it’s having right. So, our focus here in the first quarter of the rollout has really been around training and it’s around getting more people to use the product, getting them comfortable with it, getting them to load in there. There is quite a bit of setup actually for on the front end for this. We’ve actually rolled out a couple of iterations off the software just kind of in keeping with in terms of the – as w get feedback from dealers, as we get feedback from we’re continually monitoring kind of how the software is being used. We’ve actually rolled out just recently an updated version of power play that add some additional features to the software that we think are going to be helpful to continue to streamline the sales process. But getting at the heart of your question, one of the encouraging early returns here in this data has been the close rates are about double for those dealers using the software versus other dealers not using it and that is for us kind of the – that is what we hope to see as a continuing outcome of our investment in this and it’s been an investment. I mean, let’s say it’s a huge investment to do this. But we think it’s the right thing to streamline the sales process to make it more effective and we’re seeing that kind of an impact so it’s been, it’s been very, we’re very encouraged early on.
John Quealy – Canaccord: And then second question on the Nat gas side on the C&I or small like commercial very clearly it feels like a buy versus build opportunity for Generac and to your comments earlier that there was so much going on downstream in gas in the last mile. When we look forward a couple of quarters, should we expect an acquisition nothing major but something on the Nat gas side maybe domestically or how should we think about this opportunity for Generac in the next couple of quarters from an M&A perspective?
York Ragen: Yeah John I think for us it’s probably less about M&A in that space and it would be organically. I mean, when we look across the universe of opportunities with M&A for this thing, for that just talk Nat gas for a second. I mean, we really are the – we’re the standout leader in Nat gas gensets in North America and have been for sometime. So, acquisitions if we’re going to come in the Nat gas space for us would probably be, if we could find something that the expertise that we developed in Nat gas well that could be extendable into other products or other market opportunities that might be something we would look at. But frankly as I look out just in the near term the next few quarters to answer your question, I don’t see as much on that side. I see more about our efforts to push into the commercial application. So, light, this light commercial what we refer to a small footprint, retail type applications, bank branches, restaurants, gas stations, convenient stores those types of retail applications we think just need to be brought into the loop on and the opportunity and the return on the investment, we’ve got to learn the math for them. I mean, if most businesses can payback a power outage, they can payback the cost of this product very, very quickly with a single outage. And so, when you look at that and if we can get that message out there to businesses, we think there is a potential for quite a bit of upside jus in investing in our sales efforts, investing in our marketing efforts around Nat gas going forward.
John Quealy – Canaccord: Organically.
York Ragen: Organically.
John Quealy – Canaccord: That’s great. And then lastly so on the debt side currently you are very covenant light can we assume that the new tranche here is going to be similar like covenants or can you talk about a little bit?
York Ragen: Correct. Yeah, we anticipate it’s going to be basically amended (inaudible) at the existing credit facility effectively the same credit facility covenant wide upsized and with lower interest rates so and some other flexibility built in as well so anticipated to be covenant wide as well.
John Quealy – Canaccord: Great. Thank you guys.
York Ragen: Thanks John.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Over to you, Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Good morning.
York Ragen: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Aaron it sound like your market share is tracking better than you expected and power washers and maybe portables I’m wondering, can you just talk about it you are getting traction in the marketplace and how you are tracking in those product lines roughly?
York Ragen: Yeah no it’s something that on the portable generators I’ll hit that one first because that’s been a market we’ve been in. It’s been almost five years now since we reentered that market. Based on the information we see, we’re the leading share from a brand perspective, a leading share player in portable generators today, as we stand. So, we think that, that’s share is somewhere in the mid 20s. Frankly it continues to move up. We get – we continue to get placement in places, we didn’t have before season to season just looking at kind of where we are at. Certainly as our comments indicated the first quarter remain strong with portable generators. We saw quite a bit of inventory replenishment and some new shelf placements that we have got over the prior year. I think as a result of our position, our strong position from an inventory perspective last season. We think that we were very well positioned to take advantage of the demand surge that that (occur) to those products. So, we feel very good about portables and what we have done now as we translated that and as my comments indicted we translate that into this position of power washers. Now on power washers Jerry, we are still, we are still single-digit share. So, we’re not diluting anybody. We’ve got some very strong players in that market but we like our approach from an innovation standpoint. We like our approach from a value orientation standpoint the positioning of our brand as a brand that is a, that stands for something in this space in terms of being rugged, in terms of being durable all of those power washers are made in the U.S. so we’re promoting that quite heavily that is different than some of the other competitors, who are out there so we think that there is, there is a play to be had in terms of positioning ourselves as those products being manufactured here in the U.S. And so we like our position, we like long-term prospects. We think that, that kind of double-digit low to mid double-digit margin – market share is very achievable here in the next few years plus in that space.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: And Aaron can you give us an update on the Honeywell branded generator strategy is that from a focus standpoint they have taken a little bit of a backseat in all the works that you are doing with main Generac distributors and I guess, what are your medium term targets for that part of the platform?
Aaron Jagdfeld: That’s I mean, Honeywell has done very well. It’s done exactly what we wanted it to do, which was to get us entrée into the HVAC space and that’s what we’ve been using our brand exclusively to do.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Home standby in particular.
Aaron Jagdfeld – Goldman Sachs: Home standby in particular. We don’t focus as much whether in the portable gen space but we do have a few retailers, who help us differentiate product offerings for those retailers, and with a very good brand obviously Honeywell has been incredibly well recognized brand and that’s why we’re really happy to put it on the product. But in the home standby space, the strategy there all along has been to target the 100,000 HVAC dealers that are out there, where we’re accelerating our efforts in terms of training those dealers and in terms of getting them signed on board it’s a build out process much as same as what we’ve gone through with the electrical contracting space, the HVAC space takes a lot of work. These are folks that aren’t as familiar with the products. While they know how to deal with natural gas and propane fuels and they know how to deal with electricity. They are not as familiar with air cool engines or water cool engines. So, getting them trained properly technically, getting them to understand the process, the sales process. They are generally fairly accomplished sales people on the HVAC space and that’s the part we really like about that. So, we like what Honeywell is. We like the trajectory it’s on. We are getting into the heating, the cooling season here. So, what we’re finding with Honeywell is you have to continue to keep their attention the dealers that is. They get pretty busy starting this time of the year as the weather heats up. So, we need to keep them focused on the opportunities in power generation and we have to continue to figure out how to make sure we their mind share around the category going forward but we really like – we like the opportunities that the Honeywell as brought to us.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks, Jerry.
Operator: Thank you. And the final question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Over to you Stanley.
Stanley Elliott – Stifel: Good morning, guys.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi, Stanley.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi, Stanley.
Stanley Elliott – Stifel: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations. Without the momentum in the category are you seeing any more favorable responses or anybody from the home builders actually starting to take a look at this and offer this now as an option from the building side?
Unidentified Company Representative: We have Stanley, the place where we see the best traction with that and it’s – frankly it’s been a bit of where we’re seeing traction over the last several years but it’s accelerating here recently is more with the custom builders which is great because they’re looking to differentiate their product in home from large production builders with other amenities so hot tubs and generators and other granite countertops, things like that to separate themselves in terms of their product. But and so that’s the good news, the bad news is that’s very decentralize I mean custom builders are generally building in much smaller quantities of homes there is lots of them I mean you can look just in the Milwaukee market here where we’re located and there is 15 or 20 of them here and we’re – this is a fairly small market from a new construction standpoint. So you can multiply that by the top 100 to 200 DMAs around the country and there is a lot of custom builders so reaching them all with the message around this product category is where our focus life could deliver its – that’s a little bit of a slog to try to and get that built out the way we’d like to. I still continue to think that new construction is a – if we could just get some of the big production builders to get on board with instead of looking at today what we get with these guys is one-off development that they’re doing and in area the country where the power quality has been power they’ll look at that development and they’ll say okay I want to have each of the homes in this development be generator ready maybe even some of them with the generator or at least half of the option to the home owner to put one on, that’s what we’d like to do everywhere we’d like to see homes be offered up by builders as being constructed generator ready. Frankly to make a home generator ready is only a couple hundred hours it’s really – it’s about a little bit of coordination about running the gas supply to the home and the electric supply to the home to make sure they’re conveniently located to accept the generator down the road to make sure that they’re eagerly to accept a transfer switch in the home’s basement or garage or wherever the electric system is for the home. It could greatly reduce the cost of adding a generator downstream if the homes were made generator ready so that’s been our big message, we’re not trying to necessarily sell generators to builders as much as we are trying to sell them on the concept of offering homes that are generator ready.
Stanley Elliott – Stifel: And one the power washer product it sounds like the rollout is going very well, has there been discussion with other big box retailers about then adding that shelf space maybe later on at that year or certainly in time for next spring selling season.
Unidentified Company Representative: We’re getting into right now the – we’re getting in line with the season here for next spring season so with the rollout occurs generally in December, January, February timeline in terms of our production ramp-up and then placing that in market kind of February, March, April. So that those line of these are starting to heat up Stanley so we’ll be participating in those, we think there is still lot of opportunity out there, we’ve gotten a lot of traction with our washers in some of those retailers who were not on the shelf today actually if you go online for those retailers you’ll see that our washers are some of the best selling online washers that they have. So we think that, that could translate into the potential for obviously a robust discussion around placement of our products on the shelves for the next selling season in some of those retailers I don’t anticipate that they’re going to make a change from any decisions they’ve made today for this year’s selling season there wouldn’t be time to react to that but certainly we like – we like our position today on the customers that have decided to put on the shelf and we like our prospects tomorrow for those retailers that we think are very good targets for us and frankly all of those retailers we have very good relationships with portable generators and home standby so we think that, that should translate into potential opportunity for us down the line.
Stanley Elliott – Stifel: Yes, great. Thank you very much and best of luck guys.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks, Stanley.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks, Stanley.
Operator: Thank you. That now concludes the Q&A session. I will now hand the call back to Aaron.

Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today’s call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I’ll now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and Happy Valentine’s Day, for joining us today. We’re pleased to report our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results this morning, which we believe clearly provide further validation of the powerful macro growth drivers for our business and demonstrate the strong execution of our strategy. Our Powering Ahead strategic plan has served as the framework for the significant investments we have made over the past two years to drive penetration of home standby generators and develop new products that strengthen our leadership positions in the residential and C&I markets that we serve. Additionally, we have made two strategic acquisitions in last 16 months, that have given us access to new products, new markets and new geographies, so the purchase of the Magnum – the Magnum Products business in October 2011 and the Ottomotores business late in the fourth quarter of 2012. The investments we have been making have helped to accelerate our growth and are important part of our transformation of Generac into a more diverse and globally focused company. In the fourth quarter, our net sales increased 28% over the prior year to a record level of $342 million, with strong and broad-based organic revenue growth across the business. This impressive revenue growth follows a strong prior-year fourth quarter in which we grew 66% over the fourth quarter of 2010. We converted these record shipments during the fourth quarter of 2012 into record levels of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Our results for the quarter exceeded our previously raised expectations and also exceeded those of the analysts who cover our company as a result of strong operational execution, as demand increased dramatically for home standby and portable generators due to awareness created by Superstorm Sandy and other major outage events in recent years. In addition to a tremendous quarter for our residential products, our commercial and industrial product net sales were also strong on an organic basis as compared to the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by increased shipments to our national account customers. On a full-year basis for 2012, we achieved a number of important accomplishments and milestones highlighted by a record level of revenue of $1.176 billion, representing a 49% increase over a very strong 2011 in which we had revenue growth of 34% over 2010. Similar to our fourth quarter results, we experienced significant growth across all product categories and regions in the United States. The major power outages occurring in 2011 and 2012 continue to demonstrate just how fragile the nation’s electrical grid has become, as a result of significant under investment. While the outages of the past two years are noteworthy for their scale and impact, the fact remains that over the last two decades severe outages have been increasing at a nearly 20% compounded annual rate, based on data reported by the National American Electric Reliability Council. It’s now estimated that on average between 250,000 and 500,000 people every day across the U.S. lose their power for some period of time. We don’t even have to look further than this year’s Super Bowl, where the component failure resulted in a 34-minute blackout during the game. These higher profile outages as well as the everyday outages we all experience have created significant awareness for the need for backup power for homes and businesses. This increased level of awareness combined with our greater marketing and distribution efforts have driven higher interest and demand for our home standby and portable generators, as well as our commercial and industrial emergency backup systems. We have worked very hard over the last decade to build the Generac brand in one of the leading names in the backup power space in the U.S. In particular, we have been tremendously successful in making the Generac name synonymous with the home standby generator category, where we hold a dominant 70% share position in this rapidly growing market. Our ability to satisfy this growth has required us to make major investments in the infrastructure of the company to accommodate what we believe to be a new and higher baseline of sustainable demand for our products. With our improved scale, we’re adding manufacturing capacity to investments and automation, improved utilization and the expansion of our manufacturing footprint. In addition to more manufacturing capacity, we’ve used the positive momentum in our business to aggressively add engineering and sales resources to drive our strategic growth initiatives forward at an accelerated pace. We believe these investments are a critical and necessary element of our ability to continue to grow successfully into the future. In 2012, we made important progress in designing and implementing a number of focused residential sales and marketing programs, we believe will allow us to both create and close sales leads more effectively. These programs are the combination of significant research conducted regarding the purchasing process for a home standby generator. At the heart of this project are new sales tools, training improvement and more structured sales processes that are designed to better align our dealer network with Generac and to improve the overall consumer sales process. Specifically, we have developed an important new proprietary process we call AMP, which is designed to find the most likely purchasers of home standby generators for improved target marketing. This is done through the combination of current owner data regarding the exact location of our installed products, third-party psychographic and demographic data matching nearby households that represent our mostly likely target buyer, and our power outage tracking database. With this highly targeted approach, we are able to deliver marketing contact – content on a direct basis through a number of different vehicles such as direct mail, push e-mail, telemarketing or even door-to-door sales efforts to create sales leads. We have staffed a new dedicated team at Generac that is tasked with qualifying and scheduling these leads in conjunction with our residential dealers. Once in the hands of our dealers, these leads are then managed through a coordinated and professional in-home sales process that we recently launched called PowerPlay. This tablet-based application allows us to push sales leads down to our dealers as customer appointments and includes professional presentation materials. Most importantly, the PowerPlay app allows our dealers during an in-home consultation to create a customized backup power plant and detailed proposal for the homeowner. Although just launched a few months ago, we’re very excited about the prospects for both AMP and PowerPlay and expect to have a meaningful percentage of our dealers participating in these programs by the end of 2013. In addition to developing and delivering cutting-edge tools for our residential and light commercial dealers, we’ve also worked to further expand our industry-leading distribution network ending the fourth quarter with over 4,800 dealers, representing an increase of approximately 600 channel partners over the last 12 months. In addition, we continue to make progress in penetrating the HVAC distribution channel through our Honeywell licensing program. As the market for home standby and light commercial generators continues to grow, we believe that a larger, more engaged dealer network will be a necessary component in driving the penetration of these products much higher. While we have made significant investments in growing the market for our residential products, we have made equally important investments that we believe will allow us to compete more effectively in the market for commercial and industrial products going forward. Through the introduction of several new products in 2012, we have further solidified our leadership position in the growing market for cleaner burning, more cost effective natural gas fuel backup power solutions. While still a much smaller portion of the overall C&I market, demand for these products continues to increase at a faster rate than traditional diesel fuel generators, as a result of their lower capital and operating costs. As the leader in the North American market for natural gas fuel generators for over 30 years, we believe we are in an excellent position to capitalize on the secular shift towards these products. During 2012, we experienced solid year-over-year increases in natural gas generator shipments underpinning an attractive organic growth rate in our C&I products. Magnum branded light towers and the mobile generators also performed well during 2012, as demand for mobile equipment continue to benefit from a secular shift towards renting versus buying. We substantially completed the integration of Magnum during the year and are extremely pleased with the outcome as we exceeded all of our revenue and cost synergy targets during 2012. We remain excited about the strategic fit of Magnum’s mobile products as they provide additional diversification and cross-selling opportunities to our business. In addition, opportunities within the traditional (inaudible) market for commercial and industrial products, we believe there is a significant opportunity to provide smaller, more cost effective generators marketed aggressively towards the underpenetrated optional standby market, which include small footprint commercial buildings such as gas stations and convenience stores, restaurants, pharmacies, bank branches, and small healthcare related facilities. We believe our expertise and scale in these smaller commercial products, our vast distribution capabilities and our national account customer focus will allow us to penetrate these markets by using a targeted marketing approach and funneling opportunities to our distribution partners. We are confident we’ll be able to present a very compelling return on investment for business owners, who are looking to protect their revenue streams as well as their inventories with backup power protection. 2012 was also a year of heavy product development for Generac. New products are the lifeblood of any company and we’ve made significant investments in products associated with growing the market for home standby and commercial backup generators and further diversifying our company with new platforms such as power washers. Innovation has always been a part of Generac’s culture and is a core competency of our company. We believe our ability to innovate something that’s unmatched by competitors whose focus on our markets is generally secondary or tertiary at best. We’ve used the growth in our business over the past several years to accelerate our product development efforts by more than doubling the size of our engineering team and dramatically expanding our research and development capabilities. As a result, 2013 will bring more new product launches than at any other time in Generac’s 50-plus year history. New products such as Mobile Link, the industry ‘s only cellular-based OEM developed remote monitoring platform for home standby generators, which provides us an attractive opportunity to develop a future recurring revenue stream, as well as provide a higher level of customer satisfaction by connecting units that require maintenance or service directly with an authorized dealer. Another exciting new product launching in 2013 is our Protector series; a line of diesel generators developed specifically for residential and light commercial users with the industry’s smallest and most compact footprint at price points well below those of larger more traditional diesel generators. The Protector series products are also an ideal backup power solution for markets outside the U.S. where diesel is the primary or only available fuel source, and where competition from local packagers demands a very competitive cost position. In addition, we are also working with our team at Magnum as we expect to launch several exciting new mobile products in 2013, including a solar hybrid light tower and towers utilizing LED lighting technology. Finally bringing some much-needed innovation to the power washer market, we’ve recently secured valuable shelf space for the 2013 selling season with our new OneWash product; the industry’s first and only variable speed power washer aimed at making household outdoor cleaning tasks easier for consumers. In conjunction with diversifying our business with new and innovative products, we’ve been focusing on expanding our market reach into areas outside the U.S. and Canada. For the last several years these efforts have been mostly organic with the creation of a dedicated sales team and the addition of over 80 new distribution points around the globe, with many of those being in Latin America. To accelerate these efforts and to become a more global player in the markets for backup power, we recently completed acquisition of the Ottomotores businesses late in the fourth quarter of 2012. The acquisition includes the operations of Ottomotores Mexico, headquartered in Mexico City, and Ottomotores Brazil, located in Curitiba. The combined company is manufacturing and selling diesel generators from 15 kilowatts to 2.5 megawatts with a particular focus on larger kilowatt and containerized gen sets. With over 500 employees, Ottomotores is a major market share player in the growing Latin American standby power market, and provides us with the essential elements of a local manufacturing presence, access to higher power products and added distribution that we believe are critical for us to compete in the global market for backup power generation. The integration of Ottomotores is a key corporate initiative for 2013, and we’re excited about the opportunity to execute on the potential revenue and cost synergies of the combined companies. Although early in the process of exploring opportunities for revenue synergies, the combined sales and marketing teams have already identified the potential to sell our residential and light commercial standby generators, as well as mobile light towers into the Latin American market. From a cost standpoint, we estimate approximate $2 million of savings exist on an annualized basis, which we will begin to realize towards the second half of 2013 with a potential for additional cost reductions during the second full year of ownership. Much of the savings we are initially projecting will come primarily as a result of improved purchasing scale with certain components and commodities as well as from improved utilization and efficiencies in the Ottomotores’s operations. In recent years, we’ve worked hard to diversify Generac’s end markets with new products and services, which is a core objective of our Powering Ahead strategic plan. With the acquisition of the Magnum and Ottomotores businesses, revenues for our C&I products will now total in excess of $500 million on an annualized basis. Additionally our re-entry into the market for power washers provides us with a unique opportunity to gain market share quickly to further diversify our company with the addition of this new platform. Our execution on our diversification strategy has resulted in a more balanced and more globally focused company. When combined with the powerful macro opportunities in the residential and light commercial backup power market, we believe we have the right strategy in place to drive future growth. And now, I’d like to turn the call back over to York to discuss fourth quarter results in more detail. York?
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. As previously mentioned, net sales for the fourth quarter 2012 were $342 million, a 28% increase as compared to $267.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales increased 28.9% to $216 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, relative to a strong prior net sales comparison of $167.5 million, which saw year-over-year sales growth of 67.6% over the fourth quarter of 2010. The growth in the current year was primarily driven by increased demand for portable and home standby generators. The demand for residential backup power has seen a paradigm shift over the last couple of years as major power outages have accelerated the adoption of standby generators by homeowners. As the electrical grid continues to age and power outages become more frequent and longer in duration, homeowners have become more aware of the need for a permanently installed automatic backup power solution. As the 70% market share leader in this product category, Generac has been able to satisfy this increased demand through our market-leading distribution, which we continue to expand and develop. In addition, our flexible and lean operations have allowed us to rapidly ramp our supply chain and production to accommodate increased order rates for these products. With regards to portable generators, we have seen significant increase in the sales for these products as we continue to increase our market share. Our strong relationships with distribution coupled with solid execution have allowed us to capture a leading share of the portable generator market over the last couple of years. With larger investments in seasonal inventory and expanding shelf space at retail, we’ve been able to satisfy greater demand during major power outages and also increase our baseline portable generator sales significantly. The increase in residential product sales during the fourth quarter was primarily related to increases in portable generator shipments as a result of Super Storm Sandy. As we have discussed in the past, major outage events drive immediate demand for backup power in the form of portable generators. Longer-term, demand for home standby generators typically increases in an area impacted by major outages. This afterglow can last for several quarters thereafter and finally settle into a new and higher baseline of demand due to the awareness and additional distribution points created as a result of the outage. Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales increased 29.4% to $110.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 from $85.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by an increase in shipments to telecommunication and rental national account customers, for both stationary and mobile power equipment. It’s important to note that the Magnum Products acquisition became annualized as of the fourth quarter of 2012. Accordingly, the full impact of its financial results are reflected in both the current and prior-year quarterly periods. We have seen solid year-over-year sales growth with Magnum Products as they continue to gain share in the markets that they serve and execute on revenue synergies by selling mobile equipment through Generac’s distribution. Finally, the fourth quarter of 2012 also includes a modest contribution to C&I product net sales from the Ottomotores acquisition, which closed on December 8, 2012. Our other product sales category improved to $15.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, an increase of 8% from prior-year fourth quarter sales of $14.3 million. As a reminder, this product category is mostly comprised of aftermarket service parts as well as loose engines sold directly to OEMs for use in engine power products across a wide range of applications. Gross margin as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 36.9% compared to 36.8% in the prior-year fourth quarter. An increased sales mix of lower margin portable generators was more than offset by a positive impact from improved pricing and moderation in commodity costs during the current year quarter. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2012 declined by $4.2 million or 6.8% as compared to the prior-year quarter; primarily due to the lower amortization of intangibles over the prior year and a non-cash intangible impairment write-down recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of these items, operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2012 increased by $8.6 million or 16.2% as compared to the prior year, but declined as a percentage of sales by approximately 180 basis points. These additional expenses were driven primarily by increased sales, engineering and administrative infrastructure to support the strategic growth initiatives and higher baseline sales levels for the company. Adjusted EBITDA increased 34% to $83.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to $61.8 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2012 was $289.8 million, representing an increase of 53.8% over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margins for 2012 were 24.6% of net sales, an 84 basis point improvement over prior-year adjusted EBITDA margins, due to improved operating leverage on higher sales volumes. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $28.3 million as compared to $267.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. Net income in the current year includes an income tax provision of $21.4 million. Prior-year net income included a net $238 million income tax benefit, largely as a result of the reversal of the full valuation allowance on the company’s net deferred tax assets. Although we recorded an income tax provision for GAAP purposes in 2012, our current tax attributes resulted in the company only paying nominal cash, cash income taxes throughout the year. In addition to the large income tax benefit recorded in the prior year, fourth quarter 2011 net income also included a $9.4 million pre-tax write-down of certain intangible assets. Adjusted net income as defined in our earnings release increased 17.1% to $60.7 million in the current year quarter, versus $51.8 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. The increase is attributable to improved operating earnings during the quarter resulting from a 28% increase in net sales, partially offset by the higher interest expense due to the refinancing of the company’s credit facilities in May of 2012, as well as slightly higher in cash – cash income taxes. Diluted net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to $3.91 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011. As previously mentioned, the current year quarter included income tax expense, while the prior-year quarter includes a large income tax benefit due to the reversal of the full valuation allowance on the company’s deferred tax assets. As a result, the year-over-year change in income tax provision had a $3.79 per share impact on earnings per share versus prior year. In addition, prior earnings per share included an $0.08 per share charge related to the intangible asset write-down. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconciled in our earnings release was $0.87 for the current year quarter, compared to $0.76 per share in the prior-year quarter, a 15.3% year-over-year increase. The current year adjusted EPS figure includes a $0.17 per share headwind from the combination of higher interest expense and to a lesser extent, higher cash income taxes. For the full year 2012, adjusted diluted net income per share was $3.19, representing a very strong 47% increase compared to 2011, in spite of a $0.40 headwind as a result of the higher interest and taxes. Free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities plus capital expenditures was $97.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to $73.1 million in the same period last year. Record levels of shipments during the second half of 2012 helped to significant cash flow in the fourth quarter, which was partially offset by replenishment of inventories. Free cash flow for the full-year 2012 was $213.2 million, which represents 97% of the adjusted net income reported for the year. Our uses of cash during 2012 included $22 million for capital expenditures, $47 million for the acquisitions of Ottomotores and Gen-Tran, and the payment of $6 per share special dividend in June 2012. Additionally, as a result of our strong free cash flow generation, earlier this week, we prepaid $80 million of principal on our existing term loan. With regards to primary working capital, the Ottomotores acquisition, which closed in December 2012, added approximately $28 million of primary working capital to our balance sheet as of December 31, 2012. Overall, primary working capital remained at approximately 20% of LTM net sales at December 31, 2012. At the end of 2012, we had $893.8 million of bank debt outstanding, net of unamortized original issue discount, and $108 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $785.8 million. Thanks to our strong free cash flow and earnings growth, we were able to end the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.7 times, at similar levels to where we started the year, despite paying cash for the Ottomotores acquisition and paying a $6 per share special dividend. Our strong cash flow profile and availability on our undrawn $150 million revolving credit facility gives us significant operating flexibility to further invest in our future organic growth initiatives, pay down debt to our targeted leverage levels, while also executing on potential strategic acquisitions. I’d now like to walk through some guidance items to help model out our cash flows, and earnings per share for 2013. In 2013, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $60 million to $62 million, which includes $55 million to $57 million of debt service costs at current LIBOR rates, plus approximately $5 million for deferred financing cost and original issue discount amortization for the credit facility. Our cash income taxes for 2013 are expected to be approximately $9 million to $10 million, as compared to $2.8 million in 2012. This increase in cash income taxes is due to a combination of our NOL carry forward becoming fully utilized during 2013, and to a lesser extent higher overall profitability levels. Importantly, our favorable tax shield, through annual intangible asset amortization remains intact through 2021, resulting in an approximately $49 million of cash tax savings per year for the next nine years. As a result, our cash income tax rate is expected to be significantly lower than our projected 38% to 40% GAAP income tax rate for the foreseeable future. Depreciation expense in 2013 is forecast to be approximately $10.5 million to $11 million. In 2013, our GAAP intangible amortization expense is expected to decline to $25 million to $26 million, as certain of our definite-lived intangible assets become fully amortized. Our tax intangible amortization expense, which we can deduct in determining our ultimate cash income tax liability for our corporate tax returns, is expected to approximate $127 million for 2013. Our stock compensation expense is forecast to increase to approximately $12 million to $13 million. Finally in 2013, our capital expenditure spending is budgeted to increase to approximately $26 million to $28 million, as we continue to invest in high return product development and cost reduction projects, as well as capacity expansion initiatives and certain other infrastructure expansion projects. Despite this increase, this projected level of capital spending still only represents approximately 2% of our forecasted net sales. With that, I’d now like to turn the call back Aaron for additional comments for our outlook for 2013.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. We’re initiating guidance for 2013 with expectations for solid revenue growth of approximately 10% over a very strong 2012. Importantly, our outlook assumes no major power outages for the balance of this year. For residential products, we expect the demand for home standby generators in 2013 will remain strong, as a result of the awareness from major power outage events that have occurred in recent years, combined with a year-over-year improvement in the environment for residential investment and further execution on our initiatives to drive penetration. With regards to portable generators, although we have built a very strong baseline business for these products, should no major power outage events occur for the balance of 2013, we would expect to see a year-over-year decline in sales for these products. When excluding the impact of event-driven portable generator sales in 2012, we expect residential product shipments during 2013 to increase in the mid single-digit range over the prior year, as a result of continued demand for home standby generators and increased placement of our power washer product line. Although important to driving awareness for global – for backup power, major outage events are expected to have a reduced impact on our business going forward as we continue to build a more balanced and diversified company. Based on our historical experience, an average major outage event could provide incremental net sales of between $20 million and $50 million, representing the potential for 2% to 4% additional growth to our forecast depending on several factors. Specifically the impact of any given major outage event is depended on the time of the year, the geographic region impacted, the number of people impacted, our existing distribution in the area, the frequency of prior outages in the affected area and the duration of the event. With regards to our commercial and industrial products for 2013, we expect net sales to increase at a low 30% year-over-year growth rate through a combination of the Ottomotores acquisition as well as high single-digit organic growth for both stationary and mobile power equipment. Our 2013 outlook for C&I products assumes a modestly improved non-residential construction market over prior year. Additionally, due to the timing of capital spending by our national account customers, we could experience some variability in product shipments from quarter-to-quarter as has been the case historically. Summarizing our sales growth assumptions for 2013, total organic year-over-year growth excluding the impact of event-driven portables from 2012, is expected to be between 6% and 8%. Assuming no major outages for the remainder of 2013, this organic growth is expected to be partially offset by an approximate 5% headwind from a decline in portable generator sales. The acquisition of Ottomotores is expected to contribute approximately 7% to 9% growth for a total expected year-over-year net sales increase of approximately 10%. As previously mentioned, an average major outage event could possibly add another 2% to 4% to our growth depending on the impact. Consolidated gross margins are expected to decline by approximately 80 basis points to a 100 basis points during 2013, as compared to the prior-year primarily as a result of the addition of Ottomotores, partially offset by modest improvement in organic gross margins due to the favorable impact from further cost reduction initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding amortization of intangibles are expected to increase slightly as compared to 2012, as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support strategic growth initiatives and an overall higher level of baseline sales. As a result of these factors, we expect adjusted EBITDA for full-year 2013 to increase in the mid single-digit percentage range as compared to 2012. Given our best-in-class margins, capital efficient business model and favorable tax attributes, we expect to continue generating significant free cash flow in 2013. Cash flow conversion is anticipated to remain strong and be consistent with the cumulative average conversion during the past four years of free cash flow representing between 90% to 95% of our adjusted net income. In closing, we believe the end markets we serve are poised for continued growth as a result of a number of macro drivers. Demand for our residential, commercial and industrial backup generators should remain strong well into the future as we believe that the underinvestment in the electrical grid, and an aging and more electrically-dependent population, combined with more severe and unpredictable weather will continue to increase the frequency and duration of power outages. Other macro drivers for our business include a further recovery in residential investment, anticipated increase in infrastructure spending, domestic and global energy development, a rebound in commercial construction, and a continuing secular shift to renting versus buying of construction equipment. Through strong operational execution of our Powering Ahead strategy, we have nearly doubled the size of Generac over the last two years. We believe the market opportunities in front of us are significant and we will continue to pursue those opportunities with relentless focus. Through market leading innovation and solid execution in 2013, we expect to accelerate the penetration rate for home standby generators, increase our share of the commercial and industrial market, and further diversify our business through new products and geographies. When considering all of these factors, we believe Generac is incredibly well-positioned for growth in 2013 and beyond. This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we’d like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Charlie Brady from BMO Capital Markets.
Andrew – BMO Capital Markets: Good morning guys. This is Andrew on for Charley.
York Ragen: Hi, Andrew. How are you doing?
Andrew – BMO Capital Markets: Good. Good. Hey, I had a – I’m sorry if I missed this, but what did you – did you mention what interest expense and what the contribution might be for 2013 and what the contribution for Ottomotores was in the quarter?
York Ragen: So interest expense for 2013, we highlighted as $60 million to $62 million as the expense, and $55 million to $57 million of that is actual cash, debt service costs, with $5 million being amortization and deferred financing costs and original issue discount amortization. And – and the contribution of Ottomotores in the quarter, we...
Aaron Jagdfeld: So it’s very, very minimal
York Ragen: Yeah, we talked as a modest contribution.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And we closed that on December 8, Andrew.
York Ragen: Yeah, some 20 days there.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, it’s a pretty minor contribution.
Andrew – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. I guess the other question is how much of the increased CapEx is going towards kind of getting like R&D and things situated in – at Ottomotores. I know I think the prior owner might have – wasn’t spending as much on R&D?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, the R&D, we generally expense, so you’re going to see that in the SG&A line, Andrew. But, as far as obviously, there are hard assets associated with R&D as well with equipment and facilities and things. And you’re right, the previous owner of that business was a holding company based in UK, and I think it was fair to say that there is opportunity there to – for growth based on our level of investment, our appetite to invest. So, there is a piece of our CapEx expense. It’s not huge, but our capital expenditures, we’ve got a couple of million dollars in there for the Ottomotores business for next year for expansion and some R&D efforts as well as – as well as some capacity expansion.
Andrew – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And it seems like – it seems like you’re making a great push for new products and everything. I was just – I was wondering if there might be any specific one kind of product group that’s most compelling – very compelling opportunity for you guys?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Well, first and foremost we’re a products company, so we love designing and developing new products. It’s kind of at the heart – the core of the company. We were started in 1959 on an innovative idea by our founder and we’ve kind of kept that philosophy, and that core of innovation, really inherent to the company. So, I were to look across though for 2013 to answer your question, I would see – again as we said in our prepared remarks, probably hands down the broadest offering of new products that we’ve ever done in our history just based on the scale that we’ve gone through over the last couple of years in our engineering and R&D efforts. When I look across it, I’m pretty excited about some of the products that we’re developing that are geared directly towards light commercial opportunity. We talked about this small footprint retail, bank branches, healthcare facilities, those types of things, that today there is really no regulatory reason for them to have backup power, and up until recently there hasn’t been probably a financial reason for them to have it either. We think that, I’d mentioned in the prepared remarks, we call it our Protector series which is the diesel version of those light commercial products. We also have a very robust gas line of products that we’ve had for a number of years, it’s actually been refreshed this year as well; again all targeted at kind of that light commercial space. The light commercial space is a lot like, we do kind of a lot like the home standby category a number of years ago, in terms of the under-penetration, the opportunity to get in there and sell on a more direct basis with a broader distribution channel. And you have to have competitive product, because again it’s up for our business, it’s a return on investment calculation, and so we had to redesign these products to make sure that they are very cost effective both in their acquisition cost as well as their operating cost.
Andrew – BMO Capital Markets: Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Andrew.
York Ragen: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Good morning.
York Ragen: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Can you gentlemen talk about what’s your penetration rate on new homes that are being built today within your target price range is? Can you just give us a sense for your efforts there, and how meaningful of the contribution can we see in your business as the new home-build cycle really picks up steam here?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, it’s obviously a great question, Jerry, and one that – as we’ve said over the years, the new construction market is short of calling it the Holy Grail of our industry, it could be a really interesting thing for the category because it’s a lot lower in cost to install those products at that point when the walls are open, the trades are on site, permits have been pulled already for everything else if somebody is doing, the cost of the equipment can be rolled into the homeowners’ mortgage. There is a lot of upside to why you want to do this project during new construction. The challenge of course as we’ve said has been getting the builders to promote the category, getting homeowners to understand that it’s available, right, I mean awareness, just, as the category still only in its, frankly in its infancy, 10 years, 12 years old. We’ve worked very hard with builders over the last three or four years to increase awareness at their level, as well as to increase awareness at the home buyers level. As a result, our penetration rates today, we estimate to be about double what our penetration rates are. The 2.5% we quote of U.S. households, those are single family homes greater than $100,000 in value, we would estimate that penetration rate at new constructions about double that rate, because of the upside of doing it at that point. So, that has grown from where it was, although we still think it could go higher, in particular in certain regions of the country where and whether it’s replacement homes as a result of Sandy or whether its remodeling or whether it’s just outright new construction in some of the markets where power quality has been poor over the last several years.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: And I’m wondering if you could talk about the amount of shelf space that you have on the power washer side in 2013 relative to your 2015 plan? And then also if you could give us an update on how you feel about your portables market share based on the points that you made in the opening remarks?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, great question. This is kind of – those two product categories are starting to form the core of the portable products business for us, that has done very well over the last four years with the re-entry in the portable generators. We do believe that today we’re number one in brand share in the U.S. in portable gen sets, and that share is somewhere in the mid-to-upper 20% range depending on which data you look at, that has grown obviously from nearly zero rate four years ago. So, we’ve done – our teams have done tremendously well with that product and that’s come from, again we talk about innovation, we talk about new product introduction cycles, we talk about voice of customer, solving customers’ pain points with products. We’ve done all of that and hit a home run on portable generators. Now, we try to apply that here to power washers in the last year really in launching those products in 2011, accelerating in 2012. We’re still a small market share player. The market is dominated by a few big players. We do think there is some great opportunities for us, we’ve gotten some great traction in the 2013 selling season here with our product line. In particular, we mentioned the OneWash product which we debuted at the Lawn & Garden Show in Louisville in the Fall has been very well received. We’ve gotten very good placement for that product at a couple of major retailers here for the spring season. It I think bears out, still we’ve got to see if the sell-through will be or we hope it to be, right, because it’s just being put in stores today. But we think we have a very compelling value proposition for homeowners there in terms of being the only – the market’s only variable speed power washer to allow them to do a number of different tasks more simply and more easily with that product. So, really excited about that platform, Jerry, and we continue to look at what other products might fit into that platform like that, where we can leverage distribution, leverage our expertise in supply chain and manufacturing capabilities as well as, again our focus on solving customers’ pain points with engine power products.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks, Aaron. And lastly, on York’s point about afterglow continuing for six to nine months post the hurricane, should we expect residential standby sales to be up sequentially into the first quarter? Can you just give us a sense for how that’s shaping out post-Sandy?
York Ragen: Yeah. Jerry, this is York. I think we haven’t given any quarterly guidance. I think there was a number of things in terms of how you can look at that in terms of the magnitude of, say if you flashback to where we were this time last year, we were coming into 2012 after having a hurricane Irene and an October snowstorm. You flash-forward to now and you have a Superstorm Sandy which arguably could be – would be larger than those 2011 events. So, we’re coming into the year with a similar fact pattern here in 2013 as 2012. And lead times have been extended similarly this year versus last year. So, I think you would expect similar seasonality trends in terms of how, what was provided – from a seasonality perspective you would expect something similar trends as what was provided for our 2012 outlook last year at this time. And, with regards to your comment, is that year-over-year growth, I think maybe just point you to the magnitude of the events, 2011 versus 2012 and how they came into the following year.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Jerry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy of Canaccord Genuity.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity: Hi, good morning, folks. Congratulation on the good results this year. A couple of questions. First, can you guys talk about distributor adds or what the mix of new distributors was this year? Whether it’s – how quantitative you want to get, it’s fine, but in terms of expectations for next year, obviously Sandy, I imagine added quite a few new potential distributors?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Okay, John. It’s a good question. We were adding on an annualized basis between 300 and 400 net new dealers a year for the last several years. I mean, really for the last decade that’s how we’ve gotten to over 4,000. And I think we quoted – we ended the year just north of 4,800 dealers. We added over 600 channel partners in the last 12 months, which is a higher rate obviously than that 300 to 400, and that obviously is in our minds associated, especially when we look geographically where those partners were added, it’s associated quite heavily with the outage events that occurred in 2011 and 2012 out East. So a lot of these dealers are in the Northeast, but we still had – we continue to have strong growth regionally. I think one of the things about this company that is amazing to me is, when we look at our regional breakdowns for sales across over the last 12 months, we have no single region that didn’t grow at least 14%; that was our smallest growth region. So – and that’s across the U.S. Obviously, growth in the Northeast has been great with the opportunities that have been created from the events, but even out West, market – regions like that growing 14% plus. So, I think that’s a – it’s pretty amazing and we’re adding channel partners as a result really across the U.S.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity: And my second question, more on the C&I side, with national accounts sounded like they came back a little bit in last quarter, can you talk about some of the drivers there, is it competition on the cellular side, are we seeing any movement out of the FCC in terms of trying to get backup power a bit more high-profile, like it was back several years ago with some of those storms?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, the FCC sure has been talking about it quite a bit more, whether there’ll be any movement out of that talk, is I guess – it remains to be seen. I know that they’ve been holding public hearings in many of the regions that were impacted by power outages, with – all the way down to like local first responders and what not to understand the impact on those types of activities that outages have. So whether that finally grinds its way to some kind of a mandate, or some type of regulation is yet to be seen. But I can tell you that from our standpoint – the telecom companies, the wireless companies, our customers have been onboard with hardening their networks over the last decade as they built them out. I don’t think that they’re – they’re not doing anything that they don’t believe they should be doing to try and strengthen their network. They certainly don’t want to (inaudible), and their business model is not good to not have – not have it work, right. So, they understand the importance of backup power. I think that we believe there’s still a lot of upside within their network, that being said to continue to grow that out. And we think the penetration rates in wireless power still – for backup standby generators is still only in the 30 percentile range. So that would – conversely 70% of all towers don’t have some kind of generator as a backup, some have batteries, and other means, but they don’t last quite as long. If you have long-term outage, it can be problematic. So, I think there’s – I continue to think that that’s going to be a bright spot going forward, we’ve said that. I think – a lot of it depends on the capital spending patterns of those companies and the allocation of those capital dollars to projects such as backup power. But with the drums beating at the FFC on their interest level in this topic that may – that may push forward and at a faster rate some of these plans, I don’t know.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity: And my last question, in terms of – I thought you mentioned about $2 million run rate savings in the back half or as we exit 2013 on Ottomotores, can you dive down a little bit about what that is, whether it’s manufacturing on the copper-winding side or if it’s some sort of overhead, can you just give us a little taste of what you’re baking in for cost savings? Thanks, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. So John, there is a couple of things there. One is that Ottomotores is a – is our most gen set manufacturers. They call themselves manufacturers, but they’re generally packagers. They buy an engine. They buy an alternator. They buy controls. In this case, Ottomotores does quite bit of their own sheet-metal in terms of the structural components of the gen-set, that being closure to the base frame tanks and things like that. But where we see opportunities in that $2 million in synergies is really the result of what we believe our scale as a company, as we’re now $1.1 billion closing in on $1.2 billion, we do have some interesting things from a scale perspective, when we go out shopping for diesel engines as an example. And that’s what Ottomotores servers as a diesel gen-set market down in Latin America. There are some opportunities there for us to – we believe take some costs out of that process just by using our scale. There is also the opportunity as you pointed out with them. Some of things – we do a lot of vertical manufacturing here at Generac. We wind our own alternators and gas engines. We’re doing our own fuel systems, our own cooling packages, our own emission systems, and the light exhaust systems. We do our own controls, hardware and software. So we think that over time there is opportunities. Some of those opportunities are year one, but our comments also alluded to the fact that there are potential cost reduction opportunities beyond year one that would probably be more befitting of some of the vertically integrated things, like initially that $2 million is going to mainly be in the commodity supply chain space in terms of our using our scale.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hey, good morning, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Jeff.
York Ragen: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Just a follow-on the seasonal cadence, I think what you’re trying to say, York or maybe just help me out.
York Ragen: Yeah.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: The 4Q to 1Q trend; 4Q 2012 to 1Q 2013 should look similar to last year’s, is that fair?
York Ragen: Correct, in terms of how that seasonality played out with our outlook that we talked about coming into the 2012 year, you’ve given the fact pattern in terms of major outages, lead times being extended. My comment was that you would see a similar type of seasonality in 2013, as what we sort of rolled out in the 2012 outlook at this time last year. So, long way to answer, yes, to your question.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And then one is this – is this latest Northeast storm built into your guidance? And how do you frame that versus, quote, this major outage that you – you kind of frame this $20 million to $50 million opportunity?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, no – it’s a great question and one that – this is where the discussion around what’s a major outage, what’s not, is kind of an inexact science. The outage share with the latest winter storm, I think the peak was 650,000 people out East without power. And it was pretty quickly restored. I mean on balance with some of the other outages, we’ve experienced out East, and to be out of power for only a day or two for most people. I think it was a relief, you didn’t have a backup plan. So, we shipped obviously some portable generators because that’s what goes first during an event like that. So, we can quantify that and that is included in our guidance to a degree, but because power came on so quickly and frankly the retailers had restocked pretty aggressively after Sandy, later in the year, earlier this year already. So, they were in pretty decent shape. There may be some additional reorders on the backs of that event, but I think that the harder thing to quantify, Jeff, is the – is really the awareness impact of an event like that. You’ve got only 650,000 people without power, but you have 60 million people were in path of that winter storm. And so, although only a small percentage of those 60 million people actually lost power, they were all aware of the fact that they might, that they could have. And that coupled with some of the other events that have happened out there in the last few years, we call it a tipping point for people. And so, where, what is – where do people hit that tipping point, and is it again the profit – the spectra of another potential outage and people say that’s it, I’m done, I got to be ready for the next one that might happen. It pushes him over the edge to get into purchasing process into that funnel. And then, with some of our new tools, are we more successful at converting those? Time will tell. But we certainly think that it’s a net positive for awareness around home standby generators going forward and so certainly for the light commercial opportunities you talked about as well.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Okay. And then just on kind of lead times, can you give us a sense for where lead times are today versus kind of the similar timeframe last year? And then, if you can just kind of qualitatively talk about – you added distribution, I think you talked about stress tests in the supply chain, in your manufacturing capacity. How all that’s playing into how you’re thinking about lead times?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. It’s a great question. I mean, lead times, I think if you go back, you wind the clock back a year, like York had mention, we were out at the peak eight to 10 weeks. We hit a similar type of peak level this year in terms of backlog, but our production rates were elevated over where they were a year ago. So, we were – we’re already in an elevated production level. So, you kind of have to put that into consideration. We brought the lead times down now. They’re right around six to seven weeks on most of those products, which I think it’s – it’s not where we want it to be, but we know that that demand ends up being a little bit stickier than say portable generators obviously. You got to have portables there when a storm happens. But with home standbys, because it’s a considered purchase, because it’s an installed product and a project – a home improvement project in most cases, that is the process of pulling permits and lining up contractors and scheduling the entire project, which takes time in and of itself. So, at the front-end, if the contractor or a dealer orders that product, by and large, by the time the products are ready to be delivered, they have everything else lined up and ready to go for the project. That being said, to your point, we continue to add manufacturing capacity. During 2012, we made some – some significant adds to that capacity, in particular as it relates to our residential business, we put a new factory online, late in the year – this year, and we are changing around some of our production. We’ve added some automation into our – into that particular production of home standby generators that we believe frankly, because of our 70% share and our scale in that category, nobody else could – could automate the way we’re doing at least cost effectively. And so, we think that’s just going to give us further advantage over people and frankly help us bring those lead times down even further. Our standard lead times, we’d like to see that down to one to two weeks on those types of products. So we’ve got a little bit of work to do. We’ve ramped up our production. We’ve got – we’re at levels that we’ve not been at before, in terms of production today. Our supply chain, thankfully we pressure tested that last year with Irene in the snowstorm. That has worked out really well for us. We think that we’ve put a challenge out there for our supply chain to go even higher, should we experience additional demand surges going forward. But it’s clear to us that the investments in automation, the investments in capacity, these are all – we believe important long-term investments as this category continues to grow out. We just think categories got a tremendous amount of runway in it.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay great, and just final question. Can you, the 80 basis to 100 basis point gross margin headwind, is that all Ottomotores? And how should we think about mix given that portables are kind of expected to be down and residential home standby up?
York Ragen: Yeah I think if – in our comments we had talked about organically gross margins, we expect to be slightly up as a result of the number of cost reduction issues, we’ve been working on that, will roll into our product costs in 2013. But when you layer on Ottomotores, then it brings back down to that 80 basis point to 100 basis point year-over-year decline. So, I think most of the organic move on gross margin would be more of those cost reduction initiatives when price costs from pricing and commodity cost standpoint would be relatively neutral.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, but why wouldn’t we get a benefit from mix, if we’re growing home standby 6% to 8%, and portables are down 5%, or portables?
York Ragen: You’ve got C&I running in there, so at a high single-digit organic. So...
Aaron Jagdfeld: We’ve got some pretty good cost reduction programs also, Jeff, that we’ve been working on here, that we believe are going to be meaningful in terms of their impact on margins next year and going forward.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, great thanks guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You bet. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn.
Chris Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks, good morning. You’d mentioned, really to the competitors, that the residential standby markets, that secondary or tertiary at best, but we have seen a paradigm shift here. So I’m just wondering what your thoughts are on some of those competitors giving it more attention or given who they are and the scale of some of their other businesses, if you don’t see any changed kind of attention to the space?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, and that’s a great question, Chris. They – these guys – the guys we compete with – there is only – frankly there is only three of us, and the other two guys have been very focused on this space in the last five or six years. I think, since we frankly become a public company and since we started talking about the category and the growth opportunities in the category, I think they’ve seen and they’ve seen growth I’m sure in their own numbers. They’re not – all the competitors created equal I will say though; some of them focus more on the premium segment of the market, which where they believe their brand can extract additional price although the product is not premium. You’ve got other guys that I think are good competitors in this space that have a better cost position than others. But in the end I think what this comes down to is that, we believe over time that if this is going to truly become a commoditized type of and a democratized, if you will, from a word standpoint, type of product category whether like HVAC or some other installed product, there is going to be other people jumping in, but we’ve got such a head-start with distribution, with product, with some of the things we mentioned here on the sales and marketing side with our AMP – our AMP process and our PowerPlay sales tablet-based selling application, the distribution network we’ve got is two-fold greater than the next closest guy. And so we think we’ve got some really good things that – and there is some solid barriers to entry that should help us keep our share where it’s at. Frankly, our share has been at 70% for some time now. And if these guys were going to get serious about and every indication we have, if they are serious about it, you think that they would have nibbled away at our share, that’s not the case. And so, we think we can continue to maintain that going forward and we like our position, we like the fact that the market is growing. That’s – I think that’s the key thing here, we’re all trying to grow the market. And that’s – that’s what we’re focused on.
Chris Glynn – Oppenheimer: Okay. So, you think the degree of seriousness had been real enough that there is a not a new inflection, given the drama of the past two years?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. I don’t think anything more than what they’ve already been experiencing. The growth in this category is been great for not longer than two years. Right, so, and I think we have all seen that in your own businesses, and based on comments they’ve made publically, it’s clear that they are focused on that. And one of those company is a public company, the other one is not, the other one is a private company, but all indications that we see in the marketplace is – is that they are very focused on it.
York Ragen: And there has been no new entrants.
Aaron Jagdfeld: And there’s been or has been no new major entrants in the category in a long time.
Chris Glynn – Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks. And one follow-up, just in terms of, if we look at your process for identifying new power tool extensions like the power washer, just – you probably don’t want to identify what they are, but, maybe some comments on the degree of scope of what you’re considering, and how they might stack up with, how you view the power washer opportunity?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. We have a pretty interesting selection criteria process here, as we look to develop new product platforms like washers. And for us, we look at engine power tools in particular, washers was kind of at the top of our radar screen in terms of the new category to get into a couple of years ago. Because that was one of the larger potential segments, it was frankly dominated by one player, one or two players. And we thought that there was – there was an opportunity there to innovate, and to move the price points up in a meaningful way that we could create more customer enjoyment and frankly make some money out of it. So that popped out of that filtering process. There are other categories beyond that. I won’t mention them directly, but there are some product categories underneath that that we’re evaluating today on whether or not we think we would go into them. And Maybe that could come organically. It could come through an acquisition, we don’t – we have a pretty robust M&A pipeline that we continue to look at, but from an organic standpoint, power washers for us is probably a shorter pipe because we have done it before, and we are a little more comfortable with it. Anything beyond that is going to get to be a little bit longer pipe. But we think that, as I said before being able to leverage our scale, our supply chain, our manufacturing prowess and our distribution relationships, I do believe there are other products we can plug into that and be successful with. So we’re going to continue to evaluate that and push forward.
Chris Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks a lot.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the call back over for any closing remarks.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tahisha, and I’ll be operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.
York Ragen:  Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today’s call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I’ll now turn the call over to Aaron.
Aaron Jagdfeld:  Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin this morning, I want to say that our thoughts and prayers go out to those that are currently being affected by the major storm at the East Coast. This storm was built significant with regards to shrink for the large region that has impacted. Our teams at Generac are working around the clock producing and shipping products to the affected regions, assisting customers with their questions and providing technical support to our distribution partners. As the company focused very heavily on backup power generation, our business model has built around providing a very high level of service and support during times like these. In addition to our teams here at Generac, we have the industry’s largest and most well trained generator-dealer network of more than 4,500 partners that are focused on taking care of our customers during major outage events. We believe that this event as well as other recent outages will have a positive impact on our results going forward. And accordingly, we have significantly raised our guidance for the remainder of 2012. Now I’d like to turn our attention to Generac’s third quarter results, which we believe continue to demonstrate the accelerated option of standby generators into the residential and life commercial markets. Our third quarter net sales increased 26% over the prior year to $300.6 million. This follows the third quarter of 2011 that grew 49% over the third quarter of 2010. The significant growth that we have delivered over the last several years clearly illustrates the progress that we’re making in executing our Powering Ahead strategic plan Growth in shipments of home standby generators were again strong during the current year third quarter as the market for this product category continues to develop with more homeowners becoming aware of the importance of having a backup power system for their home. As a result of our execution and meeting the increased demand for these products during the current quarter, we believe we have expanded upon our leading market share position for home standby generators, as consumers further realize the advantages of the Generac branded, including the breadth of our product offerings, our industry-leading price points, and the support we provide for both our customers and our distribution partners. Major power outage events continue to be an important catalyst for demand and highlight the powerful macro drivers for our business as the prolonged underinvestment in the aging electrical grid is leading to more frequent and longer power disruptions for homeowners and businesses. Although the category has been growing at a compounded annual rate of nearly 17% over the last decade, home standby generators are only installed in roughly 2.5% of all single family and attached homes. The market opportunity for these products remains very attractive with every 1% of additional penetration representing $2 billion of market value. As the leader in this relatively nascent market with over 70% share, we believe Generac is very well positioned for additional future growth in our residential markets. The latest series of major power outages have helped to create additional momentum and the awareness for automatic backup power solutions for homes, and this is awareness coupled with our greater marketing and distribution efforts have continued to drive significant baseline growth for home standby generators in North America. With regards to our Commercial & Industrial products, an important driver for our business going forward, is the increased market interest in cleaner-burning, more cross effective natural gas fuel backup power solutions. While still a much smaller portion of the overall C&I market, demand for these products is increasing at a faster rate than traditional diesel fuel generators given their lower capital and operating costs. As a leader in the North American market for natural gas fuel generators for over 30 years, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the secular shift towards these products. During the current year third quarter, we continued to see a year-over-year increase in natural gas generator shipments providing attractive organic growth for our C&I products. In addition to natural gas fuel generators Magnum branded light towers and mobile generators have also performed well as demand for mobile equipment continues to benefit from a secular shift towards renting versus buying, and as the equipment rental companies replace their aging fleets. We’ll remain excited about the strategic fit of these products through the additional diversification and cross-selling opportunities they bring to our business. After now owing Magnum for over a year, we’re also very pleased with our integration efforts and are on track to achieve our cost synergy targets. We also continue to make important progress in executing our strategic plan. Our Powering Ahead strategy, which we implemented less than two years ago, has served as a template for investments in our company that we expect will position Generac for longer-term growth. Since this implementation in 2010, we’ve exceeded our performance goals established at that time, reaching many of those targets a year earlier than we had originally planned. As we look to the future, our Powering Ahead strategic plan will continue to be driven by the same four key growth objectives of growing the market for home standby generators, increasing our share of the Commercial & Industrial market, diversification of our business through new products and services and expanding our geographic reach. As we continue to move the Powering Ahead plan forward, we are focused on a number of new initiatives that will continue to grow the baseline business for Generac as follows. In working to grow the residential standby generator market, we have made important progress in 2012 in designing and implementing a number of focused dealer development programs, we believe, will allow us to create and close sale leads more effectively. These programs incorporate new sales tools, training improvements and more structured processes that are designed to better align our dealer network with Generac and improve the overall consumer sales process. We have also enhanced our efforts in using data regarding the location of our installed products to implement targeted marketing techniques for new sales prospects as well as having developed a more sophisticated and efficient process to capture and track sales leads through our dealer network. Additionally, we have further expanded our residential and light commercial distribution network ending the third quarter with over 4,500 dealers representing an increase of approximately 500 channel partners over the last 12 months, increasing both the awareness and the availability of home standby generators are two important elements for driving the penetration of these products higher. We also believe improving, the consumer purchasing process will allows more quickly growth as emerging product category. With regards to growing the commercial standby generator market, we believe there is significant opportunity to tap into this highly underpenetrated end-market consisting mainly of small footprint commercial buildings such as gas stations and convenient stores, restaurants, pharmacies, bank branches and clinics and other small healthcare facilities. We believe, our expertise in natural gas generators, our vast distribution capabilities and our national account customer focus will allow us to increase the market for commercial standby generators. By using a targeted marketing approach and funneling opportunities to our distribution partners, we’re confident we’ll be able to effectively penetrate this market by presenting a very compelling return on investment for business owners, who are looking to protect the revenue streams as well as their inventories of backup power protection in addition to our initiatives associated with growing the market for home standby and commercial backup generators. We have a number of new product development initiatives underway as well. Innovation is always been a part of Generac’s culture, it is something we view as a core competency of our company. As we work towards diversifying our business, we believe innovation can play an important role in helping us to achieve this goal. One example in this area that we are particularly excited about is our ability to bring so much new innovation to the power washer product category. Our one wash product line was introduced at the Lawn and Garden Show in Louisville, Kentucky last week, and is the latest addition to our growing power washer product lines. Market exclusive features such as variable pressure output for different path, automatic shutoff protection and increased ease of use differentiate this product from any other power washer on the market today. We have made good progress on liner views with the one wash product, as well as with our legacy power washer products for the 2013 selling season. In addition to power washers, we also have several product development projects underway to broaden our commercial and industrial product offering, which we believe will significantly expand the addressable market for Generac and our dealers over the longer term. Going forward, we will continue to focus on new product development as part of our growth strategy and Powering Ahead will help to guide our investments in this area. Regarding expanding our geographic reach, our international expansion continues to remain a focus as we look to increase our distribution footprint and support functions globally, as well as expanding our product offering to better fit the needs of individual local markets. Going forward, we will continue to make our international expansion efforts a priority given the significant global market opportunity that exists for backup power generation. We are also looking forward to providing further insights with regards to our Powering Ahead growth strategy at our upcoming Investor Day on November 8th. I would now like to turn the call back over to York, to discuss third quarter results in more detail. York?
York Ragen:  Thanks, Aaron. As previously mentioned net sales for the third quarter 2012 were $300.6 million, a 25.6% increase as compared to $239.3 million in the third quarter of 2011. Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales increased 17.8% to $191 million in the third quarter of 2012, relative to a strong prior year net sales comparison to $162.1 million, which saw a year-over-year sales growth of 60.5%. During the third quarter, Generac continued to experience a very strong double-digit increase in shipments for home standby generators in comparison to the prior year. Significant awareness and baseline growth for this product category continues to be generated through a combination of major power outages over the last year, expanded distribution in active markets, and increased sales and marketing efforts to create and close leads more effectively. As demand for home standby generators has significantly increased over the last several quarters, we’ve been able to execute by officially increasing our production levels to meet this demand. Portable generators shipments during the third quarter of 2012 were coming up against a difficult comparison versus prior year, which showed a strong sequential increase relative to the second quarter of 2012. Our broad relationships at retail have provided us with expanded placement for portable generator products. And as a result, we believe we’ve gained market share in this product category compared to prior year, further enhancing our leading position in the market for residential backup power in the U.S., also, contributing modestly to the revenue growth for residential products during the third quarter of 2012 with increased revenue from our power washer product line, which first began shipping in the second quarter of 2011. We also continue to see increased sales volumes for our Honeywell licensed residential products. While we’re still in the relatively early stages of both programs, we continue to be encouraged by the quarterly sales trends related to our power washers and Honeywell licensed generators. Looking at our Commercial & Industrial products, net sales increased 48.3% to $93.6 million in the third quarter of 2012 from $63.1 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the Magnum Products acquisition and to a lesser extent, increased shipments of natural gas fuel backup generators. Partially offsetting these gains with a year-over-year decline in shipments to certain national account customers during the third quarter, relative to a strong prior year comparison. As a reminder, given our strong telecom market share, there can be some variability in our C&I product shipments primarily due to the timing of capital spending by our national account customers. On October 3rd of 2012, we reached a one-year anniversary of our acquisition Magnum Power Products. Over the last year, we’ve made significant progress with the integration of this business and we remain on track with our goal of achieving roughly $2 million in cost synergies on a run rate basis. As discussed on previous calls, much of the savings we’re projecting will come primarily as a result of improved purchasing scale with certain components and commodities as well as from improved utilization and efficiencies in Magnum operations. We’ll continue to realize these cost synergies during the fourth quarter of 2012 and remain on track to achieve the full realization on our annualized basis by the end of the year. In addition the cost synergies, we’ve also taken advantage of opportunistic revenue synergies through cross selling opportunities across the businesses. Looking forward, we expect to further expand on these cross-selling opportunities with Generac’s industrial national account customers and industrial dealers purchasing Magnum mobile generators. And we continue to track a number of leads across sales teams both domestically and internationally. Our other product sales category improved to $16 million in the third quarter of 2012 an increase of 30.5% from prior year third quarter sales of $14.1 million. As a reminder this product category is mostly comprised with sales of aftermarket service parts as well as loose engines sold directly OEMs for using engine powered products across a wide range of applications. Gross margin as a percentage of sales for the third quarter of 2012 was 38.5% compared to 37% in the prior-year third quarter. The 150 basis point increase over the prior year was primarily due to higher mix of home standby generators and a lower mix of portable generators. The positive impact from commodity cost moderation, improved pricing and improved overhead absorption also contributed to the improvement in gross margin relative to prior year. All these margin improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from the addition of Magnum Products sales. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2012 increased by $12.2 million or 27.4% as compared to the third quarter of 2011. These additional expenses were driven primarily by operating expenses associate with Magnum, increased sales, engineering and administrative infrastructure to support the strategic growth initiatives and higher baseline sales levels of the company, increased incentive compensation expenses as a result of company’s financial performance during the quarter and lastly increase variable operating expenses resulting from the increase in organic sales. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $76.3 million in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $61.6 million in the same period last year. The last 12 months adjusted EBITDA as of September 30, 2012 was $268.5 million, a 24.4% of net sales during that period. GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2012 was $25.5 million as compared to $37.4 million for the third quarter of 2011. Current year net income was impacted by an $11 million increase in interest expense from the refinancing of the company senior secured credit facilities in May 2012, as well as a normalized income tax provision of $16.3 million, this is only $126,000 in the prior year quarter. Talking further about income tax – talking further about income taxes, the third quarter of 2012 includes the impact of a normalized effective income tax rate of 39% as compared to a tax rate of 0.3% in the prior year third quarter. As we’ve discussed in recent earnings calls, until the fourth quarter of 2011 a full valuation allowance as recorded in the company’s net deferred tax assets resulting substantially no income tax provision. In the fourth quarter of 2011, it was determined that a full valuation allowance is no longer required against the company’s net deferred tax assets and that valuation allowance was reversed. Therefore, starting in the first quarter of 2012, a normalized income tax provision has been recorded through our income statement. More importantly though, the vast majority of this income tax provision is non-cash in nature, as we will continue to realize significant cash tax savings, primarily from the step up in asset bases and NOL carry forwards relating to the 2006 change in control transaction and to a lesser extent the recent Magnum acquisition. As a result, we believe the company will only pay nominal federal income taxes for the foreseeable future, which is why we only reflect cash taxes in our adjusted net income calculation. Adjusted net income, as defined in our earnings release, increased to $54.1 million versus $50.6 million in the prior year third quarter. The increase in adjusted net income was attributable to improved operating earnings during the quarter resulting from the 25.6% increase in revenue including the incremental results from Magnum acquisition, partially offset by the higher interest expense due to the refinancing of the company’s credit facilities as discussed previously. Diluted net income per share for the third quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.55 per share in the third quarter of 2011. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2012 include the net $0.23 per share impact from the normalized effective income tax rate as well as a $0.10 per share impact from higher interest expense levels. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconciled in our earnings release with $0.78 for the current year quarter compared to $0.75 per share in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow as defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $61.6 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $60 million in the same period last year. Strong operating earnings and monetization of inventory levels were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures, primarily related to capacity expansion initiatives. Free cash flow over the past 12 months was $188.9 million and unlevered free cash flow was add back cash interest expense was $214 million. As of September 30, 2012, we had $882.9 million of bank debt outstanding, net of unamortized original issue discount and $58 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand resulting in consolidated net debt of $824.9 million. Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 3.1 times down from 3.5 times net debt leverage ratio at the end of the previous quarter on June 30, 2012. A strong cash flow profile and availability on our unfunded $150 million revolving credit facility gives us significant operating flexibility to further invest in our future organic growth initiatives, paid down debt to our targeted leverage levels, while also executing on potential strategic acquisitions. With that, I’d now like to turn call back over to Aaron to provide some additional comments on our outlook for 2012.
Aaron Jagdfeld:  Thanks, York. Due to the substantial power outage activity currently occurring on the East Coast, we’re significantly revising our guidance upward for the remainder of 2012, mainly due to increased demand for home standby and portable generators in the fourth quarter. Full year 2012 net sales are now expected to increase in the low 40% range over the prior year, which represents an increase in the low 30% range previously provided on our October 1st business update. As a result of the higher sales outlook, our adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-40% range over the prior year, which is an increase in the mid-30% growth rate previously expected. In addition, diluted net income per common share for 2012 is now expected to be in the range of a $1.21 to a $1.27 per share as compared to the $1.02 to $1.08 per share range previously expected. Adjusted diluted net income per common share is now expected to be in the range of $2.95 a share to $3.00 a share as compared to our previously expectation of $2.65 to $2.70 a share. We believe the long-term impact of the recent outage events will continue to increase awareness for residential and like commercial standby generators. This higher level of awareness is expected to drive further expansion of our distribution network in the affected regions, as well as create opportunities to our enhanced sales processes and marketing techniques. These are important factors in accelerating the adoption of these products, which we believe will lead to the establishment of a new and higher baseline demand for automatic standby generators. As a result, we now expect residential product shipments for full year 2012 to increase in the high 30% range. This is on top of a very strong year for these products in 2011, as residential sales last year increased 32% in comparison to 2010. With regards to our Commercial & Industrial products, despite there continuing to be a number of macro data points that suggest a moderating growth environment at least in the near-term, our outlook for C&I for the remainder of 2012 is modestly improved compared to our prior forecast, driven by increased capital spending by certain industrial national account customers, as well as increased demand for like commercial generators and certain mobile products due to the recent outage activity. As a result, we now expect our C&I product sales to increase at a mid-50% growth rate for the full year 2012 on an as reported basis. Gross margins are expected to be approximately flat for full year 2012 when compared to the prior year. A higher sales mix of home standby generators and improved pricing coupled with lower input cost should be offset by the addition of Magnum Products in our sales mix. As a result improved operating leverage, full-year 2012 operating expenses has a percentage of net sales excluding amortization of intangibles are expected to decrease nearly 100 basis points as compared to the prior year. On an absolute basis, full-year 2012 operating expenses have increased compared to 2011, as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our strategic growth initiatives and our overall higher level of organic sales. In closing, we believe our third quarter results clearly provide further validation of the powerful growth drivers for our business. We continue to believe increased awareness of automatic standby generators and execution on our Powering Ahead strategic plan will further build on our track record to strong organic revenue growth. We’re focused on growing Generac top-line through product innovation, expanded distribution and targeted marketing for our products. When considering all of these factors, we believe our company is very well positioned for future growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator? 
Operator:  Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Quealy from Canaccord Genuity, please proceed.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity:  Hi, good morning. Congratulations.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Hi John.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity:  Just a couple of quick questions here. First, with regards to the raising guidance for 2012, can you folks talk about, were you producing or getting inbound increase last week ahead of the storm. Give us if you would a little bit more the visibility of the channel, are you dealing with stockouts et cetera?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. It’s a great question, John. We have got and obviously a lot of questions and enquiries on over the last I’d call, you know, four, five days here. Really going back to since last – mid-week last week, when it was pretty clear that all the forecast were kind of aligning to indicate a pretty severe event that was going to occur. We immediately went into a mode where we work with our channel partners to figure out where their inventory positions are. We have inventory station not only here in the Midwest where we have our distribution center, we also have third-party warehouse and logistics companies that we work with across United States, many of those are in the more populated – populous regions in the country, like East Coast. And so, we began immediately shipping products mid-week last week and all the way through this weekend and frankly up and through till today here. Obviously, stock is starting to run low, the portable generators, I think, it would be pretty hard-pressed to find a portable generator anywhere. We do know that our retail partners are bringing portable generators from other regions of the country. And they are now just putting in the logistics to get those generators to the East Coast. The problem is logistics are still very difficult, moving trucks even from the Midwest here out of East Coast has been a challenge. There is a lot of debris on roadways. They are just now getting things opened up with bridges and tunnels in a lot of metropolitan areas of East Coast. And so some of the harder hit areas, it’s a challenge getting the product where it needs to be at this point, but we continue to ramp up our production and send product directionally towards that area.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity:  And then two quick follow ups. First in the Mid-Atlantic region in particular, as you folks raise your expectation of baseline business, is this the capitulation that some folks are seeing with they had a bring spring storm and now we’ve Hurricane Sandy, is that what is giving you the confidence to raise that baseline at least qualitatively with us? And just one quick follow up.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah. It’s – that’s an excellent part of – a great part of that John, I mean it’s a – when these events happen and when they happen in succession, they build on each other and the time period between the events shortens. What is does is it gets people to what we call the tipping point and so each family each person had kind of their own tipping point in terms of where, how they view this category, when their power is out, right. I mean, sometimes people can go an hour, two hours a day, two days, three days and they are not at that tipping point, they go to a second outage and they have an another extended period of time without it. That might get them over the tipping points for some people to third outage or even the fourth outage before they become very interested in the category in serious, serious prospects for a home standby generator. So, when we see events like this happen in kind of serial fashion that they have happened over last 14 call it months out east in the Mid-Atlantic region in particular. That certainly creates an awareness for the category that didn’t exist before and that awareness is going to help us and we’ve seen this over the last decade here. These events happened, they create, we see a spike in sales, that spike in sales settles down and it settles down to a baseline of sales that was higher than the previous baseline prior to the events.
John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity, Inc. :
Aaron Jagdfeld: You bet. Thanks, John. So, on the natural gas side, you know again in our prepared remarks, we said our third quarter sales, we actually saw some modest increases in our nat gas shipments year-over-year in the third quarter. We continue to see a trend there with natural gas products. This is a niche market that we been serving for the last 30 years. It’s still a very small piece of the C&I market overall. But one that we do is having the better growth trajectory than traditional diesel solutions, mainly because again the initial capital across of those products up to a certain KW point are lower and the operating costs certainly are lower as well. They have also other inherit benefits. Certainly they are cleaner burning from an emission standpoint. They don’t have a lot of the refueling requirements. So, take for instance a hospital or a commercial application right now in New York City or New Jersey or anywhere out in the East Coast without power. If they have a diesel, traditional diesel generator, the big constraint today is getting fuel to that generator. So everybody has the same constraint at the same time. You have a scarcity of resource in fuel trucks. And frankly fuel delivery mechanisms, which are many times are often, electricity is an important component of that fuel delivery mechanism. In terms of the fuel lifting stations and the pumping stations, some of those stations are off-line as well because they don’t have power or backup power. So diesel fuel becomes scarce to the commodity, the delivery and logistics have become very challenging in the storm, that has all taken away. Natural gas often times during major events and natural gas delivery is uninterrupted. In fact, natural gas becomes more abundant because there are fewer people using it during times of severe crisis. And so, it’s really made these products very attractive for a lot of reasons and we’re really seeing that pickup here in last few years.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Charles Brady – BMO Capital Markets:  Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Charlie.
Charles Brady – BMO Capital Markets:  Hey, just with respect to the updated guidance and kind of the mix that you’re seeing, I’m wondering how that plays out in terms of your gross margin outlook into the room for the remainder of the year?
York Ragen :  Yeah, I mean, this is York. Charlie, I think if you go the annual full year guidance that we alluded to you in terms of gross margins being roughly flat from 2011 to 2012, if you get back into that, that would show Q4 gross margins being similar to Q4 2011’s margins, which will be sequentially down from Q3 2012 and the main driver there. The price cost dynamics that we’re seeing here in Q3 2012 will really be similar in Q4 2012. What you’re seeing there is that there will be a mix shift towards more portable as Aaron mentioned when – when you get an event like this immediately you’ll sell a number of portable generators, and as a result were reflecting that in our guidance. Longer term as Aaron talked about that and as more people become aware and hit the tipping point to start the research home standby generators. We’ve talked about the impact of these events having two, three, four quarters of impact having – having higher order rates for home standby generator. So, as a result of Q4 will be a higher mix – Q4, 2012, would be a higher mix of portables, which would drive that mix to a lower a sequential decline in margins.
Charles Brady – BMO Capital Markets:  All right. And then, just on the C&I business you talked about tick down on some of the national account sales. Can you just expand a little bit on that and what’s driving that end? Do you think the storm activity maybe drive some of the rental customer to increase purchases maybe more than they otherwise would have just to get rental equipment into those markets?
York Ragen : Yeah, Charlie that was kind of a long lines of our comments. What we meant by national account customers was, we are a primary supplier to the telecommunications industry and if you’ve been following along with the – the power outages out east I mean obviously that the a lot of those companies are having difficulties as well, both for flooding and loss of power. And it’s estimated that upwards 25% of the cell phone capacity or mobile phone capacity, wireless capacity is offline. Right now, as we stand out on the East Coast in the affected areas, we do believe and have seen indications that the telecommunications customers that we serve in those markets are going to be improving their purchase activity here in the fourth quarter. Certainly, and then to your point of our mobile products, we definitely do see a bit of influx of orders around mobile gens, when we get events like this a lot of that is around, the immediacy of needs for those types of products. And then also what we tend to see with our national account customers there, the big rental yards oftentimes, it gives them an opportunity to do a change of equipment. They’ll oftentimes sell older pieces of equipment off and kind of refresh their fleets at a little bit faster rate as a result of maybe a higher use – higher level of utilization of these products over the next couple of months.
Charles Brady – BMO Capital Markets:  Great. Thank you.
York Ragen : You bet.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Charlie.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer Securities:  Thanks, good morning.
York Ragen : Good morning, Chris.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning Chris.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer Securities:  Just looking back at – in October, how they played out the snowstorm last year, seems that the bulk of the Sandy impact could be 2013. So just wondering what your thoughts are on – the timeframe to settle back into a new baseline type of level and whatever that turns out to be?
York Ragen : Right. I mean that’s the question, I think is on not only your mind, Chris, but ours as well. I think it’s a little too early to tell just based on, we are not sure how long these outages going to last. The duration of an outage, obviously the severity of an outage is a few components. It’s – how many people are impacted, but it’s really also for long they’re impacted. And so the longer the outages go, power is fully restored by tomorrow and the duration is shorter, that could have an impact on the, what we refer to sometimes as the afterglow of demand that we see generally on home standby. I would also like to point out though that there are really few impacts from these kinds of events. We have an immediate impact with portable generators. We are North America’s number one share of in terms of brand – brand share of portable generators in terms of producers. And we see an immediate impact from that right away and we’ll see that here in the fourth quarter. That dies [ph] down immediately, there is a little bit, there is some replenishment of stock, that’ll occur may be in the first half of next year, but the bulk of that demand surge will occur here in the fourth quarter almost immediately and has already occurred. The afterglow with home standby because that’s a – there is a – that’s a research purchased it’s a – for longer sales cycle. There is – there is a lot more things involved there, so it’s a bigger ticket item. There is building permits to pull when homeowners want to go through project like that. And so that afterglow can last between six and twelve months after this type of event. So, again, a lot of that is going to depend, we’ll watch our order rates, we’ll see how it settles out. I do believe the one thing that could push this maybe towards the back half of that six to twelve months period in terms of being longer in duration is the fact that we’ve had a number of these outrages kind of one after another here over the last 14 months.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer Securities:  Makes sense. And then, if – if we don’t know if this going to be another event at some point, but while there will at some point, but if there is another step function change in your demand, you’ve absorbed what’s transpired here tremendously well like, just how would your supply chain and your own capacity be prepared to respond to another step function change like it has over the past 12 months?
York Ragen : Yeah. It’s, whether it’s fortune or not, I mean certainly not fortunate for people who are going through outage, but from our standpoint we’ve had – we’ve gotten quite a bit of practice that going through this in terms of testing the capacity of our supply chain, making sure we understand the ability of our supply chain to hit higher levels of output and so that’s been something that we’ve been very focused on the last year. Additionally, as we’ve said – we’ve said kind of all long, we felt that organically this is pretty Magnum, we felt that we could achieve about $1 billion in sales with our – our current manufacturing footprint of about 1 million square feet. We did add quite a bit to that when we bought Magnum, but we recently we added another facility here, we bought a facility in September ahead of all of this, kind of thinking longer-term, and we’re going to bring that facility online later next year in 2013. We’ve actually accelerated our plan to bring that facility online towards the beginning of plan 2013. So, we believe with supply chain, the addition of manufacturing capacity here in the U.S. and also we will go out and watch the higher people as well, then we’re going to be very well positioned to take that next leg of growth up and handle that really without – without any kind of a hiccup.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer Securities:  Great. Thanks a lot.
York Ragen :  [indiscernible], Chris.
Operator:  Your next question comes in the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Hey, good morning guys.
York Ragen : Morning, Jeff.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Have you guys been able to do any – I know it’s early and the storm is still kind of going on, but have you been able to do any kind of assessment on, how this compares or doesn’t compare to Irene?
York Ragen : Yeah, not. Something we – we actually tracked outages, Jeff, I mean we – I think we’ve talked about this in this past because that’s – it’s part of our marketing and how we market to people after areas are impacted by outages. So, we tracked and we have a pretty robust system actually we’ve developed over the last several years. And right now, what we – what we show is that at the height of the outages, over 8 million people were impacted by this event and that compares with Irene being just shy of 6 million and that’s just – and there is a lot of reports out there in the media, a lot of different places. This is our own tracking. We think, it’s like-on-like in terms of being comparable. So we would, again to answer your question, we feel that this would be a larger event at least in terms of the number of people. And as I said previously, not exactly sure the duration yet, we’ll have to see that. There were areas of Irene were certainly impacted for a week or longer. It does sound like all the initial reports around this event put the restoration process of, at least something on par with what happened with Irene.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  So, you’re saying, your internal process which was the same for both storms, put you at 8 million versus 6 million?
York Ragen:  That’s – that’s how we see it, yes.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay – okay, perfect.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Then – and then just on your penetration rate number of 2.5%, how up-to-date is that. Does that reflect Irene and some of the recent storms, and maybe give a better sense of, maybe some of the areas that have higher penetration rates or where you see penetration rates in some of these more affected areas like the East Coast and Northeast?
York Ragen:  Yeah. The 2.5% is the pretty recent number. We updated that early this year, so it did reflect at least some of the Irene demand, that’s something that we track again very closely. And again our addressable market as we define it. Jeff, just to remind you, is a single family unattached housing stock, greater than a $100,000 in value, which is about 50 million U.S. homes. So every 1% of penetration is about a half-a-million homes. We use an average sell price at retail of about $4,000, so that’s the 2 billion market opportunity number that we’ve talked about in our prepared remarks. As far as other – looking at areas, kind of area by area or state by state in terms of penetration, which we track, we’ve got some states that are clearly more further along that penetration curve than the 2.5% average. States like Florida where you would expect, some coastal areas, New York is approaching something that’s – it’s not at – it’s not 4%, but it’s not – it’s greater than 2.5%, somewhere between there. States like Illinois that has poor power quality and Michigan also are a little bit further along in the penetration curve kind of in that low-to-mid single digits at 4% to 5% range. But we have a lot of states that really – I mean when you look at the states that just – they are – just really still very, very underpenetrated. And then, a lot of states are right around that 2.5% range. So again we just think there is a tremendous amount of opportunity in this category. It’s really only a decade old and something that we feel that – the power quality in the United States is really unbelievably poor. We traveled the world and there are places, around the world where people just can’t understand in U.S. how we can have the kind of issues of power quality we have. Now, we do have some unique situation around just the geography and the climate that we deal within the United States that make that more challenging and make it so that our grid is mainly above ground in lot of areas, but the chief cause there is it is under invested in, and that underinvestment has created just a very frail and fragile system that continues to suffer from outages.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay, great. I’ll get back in queue, thanks.
York Ragen : Thanks, Jeff.
Operator:  [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs & Co:  Hi, good morning.
York Ragen : Morning Jerry.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Morning Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs & Co:  I’m wondering if you talked about your capacity to deliver standby [ph] products [indiscernible] potential winter storm activity. If you could just give us some update on where lead times span today and just quantify for us how much added supply chain capacity you think you have today versus year ago? Thank.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Okay. Thanks, Jerry. So, in terms of just lead times we’re at today, we still do have home standby products available. Certain skews are starting to move into a backlog situation and lead times are moving out to reflect that. We have seen lead times as we saw with Irene. We have lead times get extended. I think what we’ve said about this category is it because it is a longer sale cycle and there is more involved in this process and coordinating the trades and project managing inflation of this, everything from obtaining permits to landing up contractors to the electrical work as well as the natural gas and LP work, it’s involved with the installation of these products. There is a longer cycle and once the storm passes, I think people have made up their mind that there are going to jump into the category and they’ll wait if they need to wait. Obviously, we don’t want them to wait long. We want them to get those products for the next event that may happen given my comments here previously about the fragility of the grid and the susceptibility of two further outages. The ability for us to ramp up as I said before, we’ve been testing our supply chain and pressure testing our supply chain in terms of output increases. Here over the last 14 months, we feel very good about, where we’re at on that. We’ve brought on additional suppliers where we’ve got certain components that we’re still sourced in the past. We’ve gone to duel sourcing. Many of our critical components to make sure that we have adequate supply of those components. Not only to ramp up, but in the event of some unforeseen interruption of supply of a source. So, we feel very good about we are in a supply chain. Our actual constrain was starting to become manufacturing capacity. As I said before, we acquired a plat here recently in September. When we bring that plant online, much quicker that we’d originally thought and we believe that we will be in producing products in that plant and reallocating our production between all our facilities to kind of reflect the additional need of capacity that we’re going to have to serve the market going forward.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs & Co:  And last year you were able to pick up some portable share because you carried higher inventory during the storm season. How do you think that’s playing out this year? And can you talk about it third quarter end how much portables inventory you had on hand? Thanks.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, Jerry, we felt that we were in really good shape coming into the season. Obviously, this event was really kind of the first and only event after the June windstorm out east in the mid of Atlantic, excuse me, we really don’t have much of a hurricane season. And so, inventory levels were relatively high, both our channel partners not only in East Coast, in the southern states as well as our inventory level. So, we feel we were in better shape this year than we were last year. We also had increased our inventory levels mainly because we had picked up share and we’ve got additional placement of those products. So, just with the broader distribution pipe, we need to make sure we’ve got product to fill that. So, we believe that the – having those products on hand is going to serve us well with our channel partners going forward as we look at additional placement next year. But we think that we satisfied that demand pretty well. The key now is going to be resupply, how quickly can we get additional portable generator manufacturing ramped up and get the supply of those products moving into direction to not only stock our own distribution centers with those products but our third-party logistics warehouses and our channel partners as well.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs & Co:  And on that last point, can you assure lead times with us currently or just the rough sense on how long that resupply last?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, that resupply starts – it actually starts immediately. We produce homes – excuse me, we produce portable generators, we’re talking portables now Jerry, we’ve produced portable generators here in the U.S., we also contract manufactures some of those products as well overseas. So – and obviously with regards to supply chain to bring those products online, we’ll produce what we can as quick as we can here for our safety stock levels on raw materials. And so, we’ll start resupplying right away. We’ve ramped up our production levels already over the weekend, as it relates to portable generators. And then we’ll have a resupply process lasting over the next 4 to 12 weeks, we’ll see quite a bit of stock coming into the marketplace, and we’ll see how the market absorbs that. We think that generally what we see after events like this is a fairly knee-jerk reaction by channel partners. They tend to go heavier on stock for the next season after going through major events. So what that means for next year’s stocking. It could – could it be greater than this year? I don’t know if it’s going to be greater than this year, we will have kind of the same effect last year. We had another event in 2011 that led to a pretty strong stocking here in 2012. It could – I think, it’s going to look at least similar here in – going into 2013.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs & Co:  Thank you.
Aaron Jagdfeld: You bet.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Please proceed.
Brian Drab – William Blair:  Good morning.
York Ragen:  Good morning, Brian.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Drab – William Blair:  One of my questions have been asked, sorry, but going back to a question that Jeff asked. I don’t know if this is more of a comment or a question really, but just want to see if you have a thought on this. When you’re looking at the $8 million household that are without power and comparing that with Irene, do you think – how do you think about the location of those people, because in this case you’ve got some estimates that 2 million people in New York are without power and imagine there is a lot of people without power right now, they live in something like a 400 square feet apartment in lower Manhattan?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, no – I mean, it’s an excellent point Brian and one that – we would have to dig in deeper into those outage numbers. I’m sure that the 5.8 million or the nearly 6 million we saw on Irene had a bit of that as well. I’ll go to your point, I do believe the New York Metro area in particular, New Jersey Metro area is in particular where you’ve got – those are not necessarily prospects for this product category. It quite higher concentration in this outage event than there was, so perhaps the 8 million in relation to the 6 million maybe a bit overstated, you’re just looking a raw percentage increase. I think it’s a fair point.
Brian Drab – William Blair:  Okay. And then you talked about international expense and could you give us maybe a little bit more of a detailed update on how things are progressing in Australia, the main focus is on the U.S. today, but if you could about that, that would be great?
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yeah, the Australian agreement that we signed with the company by name of Allpower, we signed that last quarter, we made that announcement, that was going to roll here late in the fourth quarter. We’re on target to achieve our rollout plans. We’re excited about that market. We do caution people, it’s a relatively small market in relation with the U.S., but again it’s the market that today the home standby generator category frankly doesn’t exist like commercial markets don’t exist. They have diesel generators as you would expect all over the world. Portable generators are another opportunity for us in Australia as well. We’re excited about our international efforts, Australia notwithstanding. Latin America continues to be a focal point for us. We’ve made some significant investments organically. We’d love to see that market growth faster for us. Organic growth in international markets is a difficult thing. There is no question about it. It takes a lot of resources and it’s going to build – it’s going to take time to build that out. But we are very focused on it and I think for us, getting on board with a cultural change of getting outside of U.S. market with our products both from a design standpoint as well as support and distribution standpoint have been very – those have been critical hurdles for us to overcome, because we haven’t have to do them before. We’re not a large multinational company today and we want to become one in the future. We think that we have a fantastic opportunity over the long term to get the Generac brand and to do something very special with it worldwide, similar to what we were trying to do here at North America with that or in the U.S. market with the Generac brand. But it’s going to take time and it’s going to take – it’s going to take a fair amount of resources and that is reflected in our increase on an absolute basis the operating expense, as the business have gone up, as we’ve made investments in things like international expansion.
Brian Drab – William Blair:  Okay. Thanks. And then, you mentioned the power washer business a couple of times and if one of you could first remind me how or may be update us on how you proceed with the size of that market. And could you quantify at all with what your level of sales in the quarter was into that market or what you’d expect it to be for 2012?
York Ragen:  Yeah, so when you – when we think of the power washer market from a retail standpoint, we look at – and this is – this will be gas-powered washed. We see that as a market that’s somewhere in the $800 million range – a $700 million-$800 million range from a market standpoint. It’s a market that – it’s actually kind of gone through, this year was a drought. So droughts are not favorable to power washers because of water restriction. So, that’s something that actually hurt the market this year and I think the leaders in that market will tell you that. We’ve got very small piece. We used to be the leader in that market. We sold that business. It’s dominated by couple of others out there, who do a very good job, serving the market. We believe there is room for growth there in innovation, which is what I spoke to in our prepared remarks. We’re not going to break up the sales individually here on the quarter. But I will say this, as we said in the prepared remarks, we believe that with some of the innovation we’re bringing to market by 2013 and based on conversations we’ve had with our channel partners there. And in particular what we debut at the Lawn and Garden Show at Louisville last week, we’ve got some new products there. We’ve got some channel partners that are excited about this. We believe we are going to be a player in this market going forward. We are committed to doing it. We think there is a lot of opportunity to with innovation to, not only to increase the size of the market, but frankly to increase the average sell price of these products. Unfortunately, the market over the last several years has been a bit of raise to the bottom with average sell price. And we believe with innovation, we can create in the minds of consumers than in the minds of our channel partners a better value, a product that has more feature and benefit and can absorb a higher retail price point. [ph] Jury is out on that. We’ll see if that – for theory supported going forward. But we believe innovation is a key to that no matter what product we’re talking about, but certainly in this power washer category.
Brian Drab – William Blair:  Okay. Thanks for your time.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks.
York Ragen: Thanks, Brian.
Operator:  All right. Your next question is a follow up from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Hey, guys. Just a follow on the pressure washing, do you have a sense of what the market size is and how you’d maybe frame where you think you can take your share to – relative to where you took portables?
York Ragen: Yes. So, it’s a great question, Jeff. I think the market is probably in that $700 million and $800 million range for gas powered coldwater washers here in the U.S. market that would be kind of last year’s market estimate, 2011 I should say. In terms of where we can take share, we believe on the portable generator side, we’re kind of in that mid-20% share range now today on portable generators. Is it reasonable to believe we can take power washers there, I don’t know – we had some pretty unique situations converge with portal gens and we had the kind of one of the larger providers of portable generators. When we reentered the market back in 2008, one of the larger providers of portable generators exited the market through a liquidation at that point. And so, it opened up a hole in supply and we were able to fill that hole very quickly and take advantage of that. Obviously the Generac brand we believe carries quite a bit of weight, not only with our retail distribution partners but with consumer as well, we’ve seen that. And that’s been demonstrated time and again. And so, where we can take share going forward? We believe that it’s likely that we’re going to grow. Right now, we are very low-single digits in this market. I would say a double digit share – a low-double digit share here in the next several years is a very real possibility for us, given some of the receptivity we’ve had to being back into marketplace and frankly to receptivity to some of the innovation we’re bringing to the market. And the fact that there is room in this market for growth and there is room in this market for innovation. I think, we are going to do – I think, it’s going to be a very nice platform for us, as we grow out, and it’s going to give us confidence to look at other potential engine-powered tools to add to that platform. So, we are starting to do that analysis today and starting to think about beyond power washers, what’s next for Generac. We’re very aggressive with engine-powered products, we are an engine manufacturer ourselves, on our own right, we manufacture really great air-cooled engines and liquid-cooled engines, and we think that there is room in the market for products that use those engines. And so, we are going to continue to push on that going forward.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay. Great. And just a couple of follow ups on commercial. Can you give us the Magnum acquisition contribution in the quarter? Sure, Jeff. It was – if we grew 48% total for C&I, Magnum was basically most of that grew just over – its 50%. Organic C&I was slightly down, and again that was mainly due to the – some of that timing of those national account telecom customers ordering patterns, so, exclude Magnum and telecom actually. But, we’re about flat on C&I in the third quarter. So...
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay, great. And then – that was my follow up. What are your national accounts – some of these big national account telecom customers telling you about CapEx plans into 2013?
York Ragen: We wish we could get them to tell us a lot more. Unfortunately, the planning cycle there – we – I’m not sure that they are completely done yet frankly and that might be why we don’t get a lot of insight. Although in years passed, it’s been difficult to get quite a bit of information, they can give their CapEx planning at large levels. We get sound bites of what those CapEx levels look like, but unfortunately if you doesn’t filter down necessarily to exactly how that translates out into generator purchases. So, we can just look what we’re seeing right now, Jeff, and what we can tell you is that interest has increased for those products with 25% of the wireless capacity offline as a result of the events out there, some of it, not all related to power losses, of course flooding and everything else being part of that. But certainly that puts pressure on carriers to make sure that they’ve got robust plans to have their networks up time be a lot greater than they are today when events like this happen. So, we think that, that’s going to be a net positive for us with those customers going forward. We stand ready to serve those customers with increased capacity. We’ve got products for all of those customers that we’ve been channel partners with them, and we have been a strong provider of those types of products to the industry for a long time. And there are a lot of Generac backup generators running on cell towers right now today as we speak around East Coast.
Jeff Hammond – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay. Thanks, guys.
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, Jeff.
York Ragen:  Thanks, Jeff.
Operator:  And that concludes the question-and-answer portion of this conference. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Aaron Jagdfeld, CEO and President for any closing remarks. Please proceed.
Aaron Jagdfeld:  Great. Thank you. We really like to thank everybody for joining us this morning and just one last quick reminder that again we have an investor day for the company next week on November 8th. So, we intend to detail out more of our Powering Ahead growth strategy a little bit more of a granular level and we look forward to discussing that with those of you that will be in attendance. Thank you again this morning.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-08-02 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Second Quarter 2012 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Fab and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. York Ragen, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed. 
York Ragen: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2012 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and CEO.
 We will begin our call today by commenting on forward looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time-to-time by Generac Holdings or its employees may contain forward-looking statements and involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward looking statements.
 Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements in the associated risk factors.
 In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures including reconciliation to comparable US GAAP measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings.
 I'll now turn the call over to Aaron. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report our second quarter 2012 results this morning which we believe reflect the powerful macro growth drivers for our business and a continued progress we're making and executing our Powering Ahead strategic plan.
 Our second quarter net sales increased 48% to $239.1 million and on a pro forma basis our net sales for the last 12 months as of the end of the second quarter were approximately $1.1 billion. Growth in shipments of home standby generators were again strong during the quarter as the market for this product category continuous to further develop with more home owners becoming aware of the importance of having a backup power system for their home.
 Major outage events like the ones recently experienced in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions in late June and early July are further examples of the powerful macro drivers for our business, as the prolonged under investment in the aging electrical grid is leading to more frequent and longer power disruptions for homeowners and businesses.
 With only 2.5% of US households owning a home standby generator, we believe the latest series of outages both during the second half of 2011 and again at the end of the second quarter of 2012 have helped to create significant awareness for this growing product category.
 As we've experienced in the past, we expect this to make increased awareness will accelerate the adoption of these products, leading to a new and higher baseline level of demand over the longer term. As part of our Powering Ahead strategic plan we have a number of sales and marketing initiatives designed to extend the positive impact that outage events have on home standby generator demand.
 In addition, increased home standby sales we also experience solid double digit growth in portable generator shipments as we further expanded placements for these products during the quarter. Our ongoing success in portable generators after reentering in this category 4 years ago has further solidified our leading position providing a full range of backup power products for the residential market.
 Additionally, well we're still in the early stages of both programs we continue to be encouraged by the quarterly sales trends related to our recent residential product introductions of power washers and Honeywell licensed generators.
 Magnum products has also contributed to our year-over-year sales growth as demand for mobile equipment has benefited from a secular shift towards renting versus buying and as the equipment rental companies replace their aging fleets. As we have mentioned previously, with little to know overlap with Generac's products, distribution channels and end markets, the Magnum acquisition brings additional diversification to our business, while also providing cross selling opportunities for our sales teams.
 We're also making good progress with integrating Magnum's operations and are on track to achieve our cost synergy targets laid out at the time of the acquisition. After 3 quarters of ownership we continue to see Magnum as a complementary and strategic fit with Generac.
 Another important driver for our business going forward is the increase market interest in cleaner burning, more cost effective natural gas fuel backup power solutions. While still a much smaller portion of the overall C&I market, demand for these products is increasing at a faster rate than traditional diesel fuel generators given their low capital and operating cost.
 As a leader in the Northern American market for natural fuel generators for over 30 years, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the secular shift towards these products. During the second quarter we continued to see increased year-over-year shipments of natural gas generators providing attractive organic growth for our C&I business.
 In addition, to capitalizing on the powerful macro growth drivers for our business we're making important progress in executing our Powering Ahead strategic plan. This strategy implemented less than 2 years ago has served as a template for our investments in the company that we expect will drive our longer term baseline growth.
 These initiatives are linked to each of our 4 strategic objectives of growing a residential standby market, gaining share of the commercial industrial market, diversifying our business for the introduction of new products and services and expanding our geographic reach.
 Commenting specifically on geographic reach, international expansion continues to remain a focus as we look to increase our distribution footprint and support functions globally. Earlier this week we announced the signing of a distribution agreement with Allpower industries of Victoria, Australia to sell and service Generac branded home standby generators, portable generators and power washers through their well-established network of over 400 dealers in Australia and 150 dealers in New Zealand.
 Even though total family household, single family households are projected to grow to $9.5 million by 2017, the market by for home standby generators in Australia and New Zealand is currently underdeveloped, with no manufacturer having any meaningful level of market penetration.
 As such, we see this agreement with Allpower as an attractive entry point into this market. Going forward, we will continue to make international expansion of priority given the significant global market opportunity that exists for backup power generation.
 Finally, during the quarter we paid to our shareholders previously announced special cash dividend of $6 per share. Our ability to return significant capital to shareholders with a special cash dividend and directly attributable to our strong free cash flow and demonstrated track record of paying down debt.
 I would now like to the turn the call back over to York to discuss second quarter results in more detail. York? 
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. As previously mentioned net sales for the second quarter 2012 were $239.1 million, a 48.2% increase as compared to $161.4 million in the second quarter of 2011.
 Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales increased 33.8% to $123.4 million in the second quarter of 2012, from net sales of $92.2 million in the second quarter of 2011. During the second quarter, Generac continued to experience the strong double digit increase in shipments for home standby generators in comparison to the prior year.
 The major outage events that have occurred over the past year combined with the company's initiative to increase the awareness and availability of home standby generators have helped to drive baseline growth for this product category.
 As demand for home standby generators has significantly increased over the last several quarters, we've been able to execute by rapidly increasing our production level to meet this demand. With regards to portable generators, we continued to see strength for these products during the second quarter 2012 with solid double digit growth versus prior year.
 Our broad relationships at retail have provided us with an increase in portable generator shelf space and corresponding market share compared to prior year, further enhancing our leading position in the market for residential backup power in the US. Also contributing modestly to the revenue growth for residential products during the second quarter 2012 was increased revenue from our power washer product line which first began shipping in the second quarter of 2011.
 Looking at our commercial industrial products, net sales increased 76.4% to $101.1 million in the second quarter 2012 from $57.3 million in the second quarter of 2011. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the Magnum products acquisition and to a lesser extent increased shipments of natural gas fueled backup generators, partially offsetting these gains was a decline in shipments in national account customers during the current year second quarter.
 As a reminder, there can be some variability in our C&I product shipments primarily due to the timing of capital spending by our national account customers. With regards to Magnum, our progress to date with the integration of this business continues to be favorable as we work towards our goal of achieving roughly $2 million in cost synergies on a run rate basis. Much of the savings we are projecting will come primarily as a result of improved purchasing scale with certain components and commodities as well as from improved utilization and efficiencies in Magnum's operations and the consolidation of certain administration related expenses.
 We will continue to realize these cost synergies throughout 2012 and remain on track to achieve the full realization on an annualized basis by the end of the year. Looking forward, we expect to take advantage of future cross selling opportunities, as we've had early successes with Generac's industrial national account customers and industrial dealers purchasing Magnum mobile generators and we continue to attract a number of leads across sales teams both domestically and internationally.
 Our other product sales category improved to $14.6 million in the second quarter of 2012, an increase of 23.7% from the prior year second quarter sales of $11.8 million. As a reminder, this product category is mostly comprised of sales of aftermarket service parts as well as loose engines to equipment OEMs.
 The increase in the other product category primarily relates to the contribution of parts revenue from the Magnum acquisition, increased service part sales as there were local several initiatives aimed at improving our focus on aftermarket sales opportunities, as well as increased demand for service parts generated by the major outage events.
 Gross margin as a percent of sales for the second quarter 2012 was 36.6% compared to 37.4% in the prior year second quarter. The 80 basis point decrease in gross margin percent over the prior year was primarily due to the mixed impact from the addition of Magnum product sales. Partially offsetting this decline was the higher sales mix of home standby generators and the positive impact from certain pricing increases implemented in the prior year, as well as improvements in our overhead absorption and the moderation of certain commodity costs.
 Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2012 increased by $11.7 million or 30.4% as compared to the second quarter of 2011. These additional expenses were driven primarily by operating expenses associated with Magnum, increased sales, engineering and administrative infrastructure to support the strategic growth initiatives and higher baseline sales levels of the Company, increased incentive compensation expenses as a result of the Company's financial performance during the quarter, and lastly, increased variable operating expenses resulting from the strong double-digit increase in organic sales.
 Adjusted EBITDA increased 45.1% to $54.6 million in the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $37.6 million in the same period last year. Pro forma for the Magnum acquisition, last 12 months adjusted EBITDA as of June 30, 2012 was $258.3 million or 23.9% of pro forma net sales during that period and a $56.4 million increase since December 31, 2012.
 GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $9.3 million as compared to $15.3 million for the second quarter of 2011. Current year net income includes the pretax charge for refinancing related cost of $11 million and a normalized income tax provision of $6.4 million.
 As previously announced, on May 30, 2012, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior secured credit facilities, pursuant to which it has incurred $900 million of senior secured term loans to replace its $575 million term loan facilities.
 Additionally, the Company obtained $150 million asset-backed revolving credit facility to replace its existing $150 million unfunded revolving credit facilities.
 The new term loans will mature in 2018 with interest accruing at LIBOR plus 5% with a LIBOR floor of 1.25%. The new revolving credit facility will terminate in 2017 and interests will accrue on drawn proceeds using availability-based pricing grid initially starting at LIBOR plus 2.0%.
 Following the refinancing, the Company used the remaining proceeds from the new term loans along with cash on hand to fund a special cash dividend to stockholders of $6.00 per share and to pay related financing fees and expenses. The special dividend which was paid on June 29, 2012 constituted a declared amount of approximately $408 million in aggregate, of which $404 million was paid in the quarter.
 As a result of the refinancing transaction, a non-recurring charge of approximately $11 million was recorded during the second quarter of 2012 related to financing cost and other related expenses.
 Due to higher debt levels and cost of debt from the refinancing, interest expense in the second quarter of 2012 increased to $9.9 million as compared to $5.9 million in the same period last year.
 With regards to income taxes, the second quarter of 2012 includes the impact of a normalized effective income tax rate of 40.5% as compared to a tax rate of 0.6% in the prior year second quarter.
 As we have discussed during the last 2 earnings calls, until the fourth quarter of 2011 a full valuation allowance was recorded on the Company's net differed tax assets resulting in substantially no tax provision.
 In the fourth quarter of 2011, it was determined that a full valuation allowance was no longer required on the Company's net deferred tax assets. Therefore starting in the first quarter of 2012, a normalized income tax provision has been recorded.
 Looking forward, we continue to expect a full year normalized tax rate in the 38% to 40% range during 2012. More importantly though, this expected tax provision rate is virtually all non cash in nature as we will continue to realize significant cash tax savings primarily from the step up on asset basis and NOL carry forwards relating to the 2006 change in control transaction and to a lesser extent the recent Magnum acquisition. As a result, we believe we will not be paying federal income taxes for the foreseeable future which is why we only reflect cash taxes in our adjusted net income calculations.
 Adjusted net income as defined in our earnings release increased to $39.9 million versus $27.7 million in the prior year of second quarter. The strong increase in adjusted net income is attributable to improved operating earnings during the second quarter resulting from the 48.2% increase in revenue, including the incremental results from the Magnum acquisition, partially offset by higher interest expense due to the refinancing of the company's credit facilities.
 Diluted net income per share for the second quarter was $0.14 compared to the $0.23 per share in the second quarter of 2011. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2012 include the net $0.25 impact from the aforementioned items relating to the non-recurring refinancing cost and normalized effective income tax rate. Adjusted diluted net income per share as reconciled in our earnings release was $0.58 for the current year quarter compared to $0.41 per share in the prior year quarter.
 Free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx was $17.8 million in the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $13.5 million in the same period of last year.
 Strong operating earnings were partially offset by increased working capital investment driven by seasonal finished goods inventory replenishment and additional raw material safety stock for rapid demand response. Free cash flow over the past 12 months was $187.3 million, representing a conversion of 90% of the adjusted net income reported during that period.
 As of June 30, 2012 we had $895.3 million of bank debt outstanding, net of unamortized original issue discount and $10.3 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand resulting in consolidated net debt of $885 million.
 Our consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of second quarter was 3.4x on a pro forma basis as compared to 4.5x net debt leverage ratio at the time of our IPO in February 2010 and a 2.0x net debt leverage ratio at the end of the previous quarter on March 31, 2012.
 We're confident that our new capital structure will allow us to further invest in our future organic growth initiatives and will provide the flexibility for potential acquisitions.
 With that I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide some additional comments on our updated outlook for 2012. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. As a result of solid execution in the second quarter of 2012 and an increased outlook for residential sales for the third quarter, we were revising upward our sales guidance for full-year 2012.
 Full-year total net sales are now expected to increase in the low-20% range over the prior year, which represents an increase from the high-teens growth rate previously expected. The higher revenue outlook is primarily attributable to an expected increase in portable and home standby generator shipments as a result of the recent power outage events that occurred in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions in late June and early July.
 As was the case with our previous guidance our revised guidance assumes no material change in the macroeconomic environment and no additional major power outage events during the remainder of the year.
 Despite the fact that there have been a number of recent data points that suggest a clearly more cautious tone for commercial and industrial markets for the remainder of 2012, our sales outlook for our C&I products for the full year remains largely unchanged. And we continue to expect a low single digit organic growth rate for the year on a pro forma basis assuming Magnum was included in our results for all of 2011.
 On an as reported basis, we expect our C&I products to be up in the high 40% range for the full-year of 2012. Specifically for residential products, we expect shipments for full-year 2012 to increase approximately 10% over the strong comparison in 2011.
 Consistent with our previously issued guidance, gross margins are expected to be approximately flat for full-year 2012 when compared to the prior year. The unfavorable mix impact of adding Magnum products is still expected to be offset by a higher sales mix shift towards home standby generators and a lower mix of portable generators.
 Additionally, the realization of price increases, improved manufacturing overhead absorption and commodity cost moderation should also impact gross margins favorably for the full-year 2012 in comparison to the prior year.
 Also in line with our previous guidance, as reported consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding amortization of intangibles are expected to be slightly higher as compared to 2011 as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our strategic growth initiatives and our overall higher level of sales.
 As a result of our improved sales outlook, we have also raised our guidance for adjusted EBITDA for the full year as we now expect an increase in the high-teens range over the prior year, representing an increase from the mid-teens growth rate from our previous guidance.
 As previously announced with the refinancing of our credit facility during the second quarter, we are also reiterating our guidance for interest expense for full-year 2012. We expect interest expense to be in the range of $49 million to $50 million which includes approximately $45 million of debt service cost at current LIBOR rates plus approximately $4.5 million for deferred financing cost and original issue discount amortization for the new credit facility.
 Interest expense during the third quarter of 2012 specifically, we expect the full  -- which is the first full quarter under the new capital structure is expected to be $17.1 million to $17.3 million which includes approximately $1.5 million of deferred financing cost and original issue discount amortization.
 In closing, we believe our second quarter results clearly provide further validation of the powerful growth drivers for our business. Execution on our Powering Ahead strategy is leading the revenue growth and overall diversification in our business. We continue to grow the Company's top line to product innovation expanded distribution and increased awareness for our products.
 When considering all of these factors combined with our competitor advantages and our intense focus, we believe Generac is well positioned to capitalize on the expected increase and demand for backup power.
 This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you again for joining us today at this time. We would like to open up the call for questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. 
Michael Halloran: So on the guidance side a lot of color there, I appreciate it. Just could you give us a sense qualitatively for how much of that increase on the revenue side fell into 2Q and how much you expect to come into the 3Q? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: I think the bulk of it is something we're looking at in 3Q. Obviously we? 
Michael Halloran: Yes. I think there was a little bit of a beat in Q2 as -- from our prior guidance. So the bulk like? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: A lot of that, Mike, is a result of the events that occurred, the event I think it happened the night of June 29, our quarter ends on June 30. So there is not a heck of a lot of that event in Q2, it's mostly in Q3. 
Michael Halloran: And it sounds like but for that the back half of the year guidance is unchanged. Right? 
York Ragen: That would be? 
Michael Halloran: On the top line side. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: On the top line side, I think that's the way to think of that, right. 
Michael Halloran: All right. And then on the international side, really good to see you start seeing some wins on that side after the increased investments you guys have made. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what other opportunities like this you see in other regions? Is it a pretty rich pipeline or is this kind of a one off type thing? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean basically what we've done and this is our approach, I don't know if it's exactly the right approach, but it's our approach and I think it fits what we're trying to accomplish here. But we're taking the globe and we're looking at regions of the globe that fit our products where we can be most competitive and certainly where outages are more prevalent and we've distilled that down into kind of a roadmap if you will for ourselves to follow. And we started out with Latin America last year as we I think previously described to everybody on the calls. We believe Australia, the New Zealand market is really kind of a fairly logical step, frankly a fairly easy step for us in those markets. You can think of Australia, Australia is a big island. A lot of the housing is kind of towards the coastal regions. They do get some severity of weather similar to the U.S., the outages aren't quite the same frequency level as what we experience here in the U.S., but home values, single family home values actually eclipse that of the U.S. on average.
 So we believe that it's a market that's got some potential. Certainly other parts of the world where natural gas, Australia being an area of the world where nat gas is very prevalent, other areas of the world where nat gas is prevalent, you can think of Russia, the Ukraine, there are parts of Latin America where natural gas is becoming a bigger force in terms of the fuel source. Those would be areas on our roadmap that we're concentrating on. 
Michael Halloran: Good color there. And then last from me, could you just talk a little bit about how C&I and then the legacy business and as well as separately the Magnum business, how those have tracked through the year and through -- specifically through the second quarter? If you have seen signs of slowing on the organic side, on either of those platforms or has it been a little bit more stable? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes, I think it's a great question. I mean obviously we're peppered with news from other companies and macroeconomic news that on the C&I side that should give us pause and frankly it does. I think we might -- we might take the position that we were a bit conservative early on in our guidance on C&I for the full year. I think we may have suffered a bit for that relative to other companies coming out a little bit stronger out of the gate than we did, but I think the year is playing a bit into our hand relative to -- our business is a late cycle business when we talk about stationary products in particular and so we look for some of those things that are early on that are kind of leading indicators for us. We saw a few of those things earlier this year, we started issuing that guidance that kind of gave us pause.
 The other thing I would tell you, the second half of the year traditionally in particular with national accounts for us tends to be a lighter -- first half is stronger than second half generally, because budgets dry up, it's not always the case, but in general it's kind of a rule of thumb. So as far as what we're seeing, I think it's playing out along those trends. I do think there are some areas of concern relative to, when we look at Magnum's business in particular, we look at the large national rental houses, just their plans for CapEx spending in 2H versus 1H, that obviously gives us a little bit more pause. We think that's appropriately reflected in our guidance here as we kind of come back out for the second half.
 So on the legacy business, I think what we're seeing there is we still, again as we mentioned we like the nat gas space, that's been a nice area of growth, continues to be more aligned as what we refer as the optional standby market. So it's geared towards smaller businesses, those companies for which standby power generation is really a business decision and with net gas being priced appropriately relative to the capital cost of that equipment as well as the operating cost associated with gas, nat gas has really come on strong is I think a very solid way for businesses to protect revenue streams, inventories from spoilage and whatnot and particular in light of some of the outage events that occurred last year.
 On the diesel side and with, in particular, larger projects appear for us anyway looking at our quote book and our quoting activity appeared to be moving out further in terms of the quote-to-order conversion, it to be taking longer on bigger projects. So I think that's fairly consistent with what we heard across the market. I don't think we're seeing anything that's specific at Generac as much as it is, more of a -- some uncertainty forming around the market. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. 
Jerry Revich: Can you gentlemen just say a bit more about the opportunity in Australia and how meaningful you see that part of the business over the next 3 to 5 years, maybe frame for us the level of investment you're considering and help us understand that pace of introduction path? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes and it's a great question Jerry and one that we're trying to obviously get our arms around as well. In terms of the market opportunity in Australia, again is what as I said just a minute ago, I think we see it as a very logical step for us and it's a country rich in nat gas. It's a country with single family home values, but a viable that of the U.S. which is, frankly it's typical to find markets like the U.S. and housing anywhere in the world, Australia probably approximates the U.S. closer than any other market from a valuation standpoint.
 And then the fact that they are coastally located, most of the housing that is in populous areas and they do have the severity of weather from strong winter weather to obviously typhoons and things that impact them in their summer months. So 9.5 million homes is the projection for single family homes by 2017. I do think, just if you wind the clock back and you look at what our North America here, it's taken us some 20, 25 years to get to the point where we're at a 2.5% penetration. So I don't think that we want to overstate the impact that this could happen to the company, but I think it's a very logical step for us to, it's kind of an entry point to get in this market. We're doing it through a very well known distributor who has a lot of locations relative to distribution, 400 dealers in Australia, another 150 in New Zealand.
 We think that we picked a good partner here. We do have to figure this market out though, there is no question it's going to take some time sometime to break that out and figure out the best way to sell them in this market. It may not form out the same way as the U.S. market in terms of just the sales process. We have to figure that out, how to engage the electrical contractors who're going to be needed to install the products and things like that. But we're excited about it. It really represents for all intents and purposes our first major foray outside of the U.S. We're going to staff it appropriately. We're going to have some dedicated resources internally here that will shepherd that market eventually, probably aiming up in the Australian market directly working for us. But right now we're going to have in the startup phase, the distributor is going to provide really all of the support and the requirements that we're going to need to launch the products there. 
Jerry Revich: And in terms of the residential standby business in the U.S., can you just frame for us where lead times stand today? And just if you could give us an update on how the Honeywell branded generator program is going? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Sure. So lead times as we said at the end of Q2 or at the end of Q1 excuse me, we're coming back into kind of the normal range of anywhere between 0 and 2 weeks depending upon the model. I think they really came into full, back to that level in the beginning of Q2 and by the end of Q2 we've remained there and in fact here in the beginning of Q3, we've remained there even with the outage events. So I mean we don't see lead times any longer than what they normally are at this point.
 As for Honeywell product line, that continues as we said in our prepared remarks, we like the trajectory of that product launch. It's been about a year now since we launched it about 3.5 quarters here and it's doing exactly what we wanted to do which was to give us access with this product category to the HVAC market more directly.
 Our 4,600 dealers are roughly, there is a high concentration of dealers if not all then that are somehow involved with the electrical trade businesses as oppose to the HVAC business. We see the HVAC distribution channels are very viable distribution channel for these products and the Honeywell brand is a great way to go after that channel we believe with a brand that's not specific to any one HVAC OEM which is the former program that we had in place, which was a good program, but frankly only gave us access to that percentage of the market for which that OEM had share in. So Honeywell we believe is more agnostic as a brand going into the HVAC space and therefore it should give us a broader opportunity set over the long haul, but we like where it's headed. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. 
Christopher Glynn: Again maybe the lead times answers it, but I was just wondering what your thoughts are on channel inventory and sell through given the dynamics over the past year and half, maybe some eager beaver channel partners out there. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean channel inventory as it stands today is we believe probably frankly a little light going into what should be the busiest time of the year for us as it relates to standby generators, which as we've said on previous comments and previous remarks Chris, standby is not a category of product that's heavily inventoried to begin with, but in places where it is such as the wholesale channel, some are larger dealers, some of our ecommerce partners, those inventories are we believe probably at a lower level than they would normally be as -- more as a result of this latest series of events.
 Portable generators are probably the latest channel checks that we had, we are roughly in line with where we need to be for that. We are ordering -- we're probably a little bit a later than we would like to be there coming into season, so we're bringing a little bit more stock in just to make sure that we are set for the upcoming season should an outage event curve of the kind of magnitude that we saw last year. We want to be ready to handle that. But I think for right now I would tell you that inventory levels are, if they are not at normal they are maybe just slightly under where they would -- where we would want to see them at this point. 
Christopher Glynn: It sounds good. And just wanted to try to frame the recent outage events, if I look at the 2 events last year and the total impact on your business, maybe I'd put a Snowtober at 1/3 and Irene at 2/3 and looking at the Derecho, it's comparable to Snowtober. So I just wanted to bounce that of you. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. I think you'd look at the Derecho is, we're feeling it's somewhat smaller than Snowtober. I think the thing that Snowtober benefited from to use your term and others who have used it and coined it. That event because it follows only 8 weeks apart from the Irene event and roughly in the same geographical location, because of the closeness of those 2 events I think it exacerbated somewhat the echo effect that Snowtober had and therefore may have made it a bigger event strictly from the impact that it has on our business, right.
 I won't speak to your 1/3, 2/3 relative to the impact, but I would say that if you had the rank order of the events, Irene was the bigger event, Snowtober was in the middle and then I would put the Derecho is somewhere kind of underneath that Snowtober event. York I don't know if you see it the same way. 
York Ragen: Yes, Chris I think if you look at our revised guidance in terms of total sales where we say previously we're talking high-teens growth year-over-year and now talking low 20s and that predominantly as we talked about is as the result of some of these major outages we saw at the end of June, early July, they backed a little bit off for some of the Q2 beat, but majority of that upwardly revised guidance is in fact from those outages so you can sort of zero in from that standpoint. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Hammond with Keybanc Capital Markets. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Just to follow on the storms, can you just maybe frame how you're thinking sequentially about the progression just given the storm activity and what you're seeing around channel inventories and just to kind of frame how the rest of the year shapes up? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. I think -- again and I think Jeff you can kind of look at our revised guidance which we said is mainly the result of this event. So I mean if you wanted to kind of bracket that guidance change as in terms of the impact of that and again I think a lot of that focus more on the third quarter as a result of that. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Right. So it's a modest step down from 2Q -- 3Q is a modest step down from 2Q and then you stepped out further into 4Q, is that the way to? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: No, that's not the way to look. 
York Ragen: I reckon a little pop I mean because of - from Q2 to Q3 I think quite a sequential. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Sequentially Q2 to Q3, we would say that would actually improve on the residential side. Again a lot of portable generators were sold during an event like that, we see an immediate reaction. We do expect an afterglow effect as well in those areas with home standby to come over the next 6 to 12 months. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then that would kind of back you into weaker -- considerably weaker 4Q I guess. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Well again? 
Jeffrey Hammond: Again relative? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. If we don't get the comparable outage events as we had last year? 
Jeffrey Hammond: Sure. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Those were big events, right, so? 
York Ragen: Compare that -- the key is a new and higher baseline, Jeff. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Right. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Right, nicely above 2010, but certainly a step down from the 4Q strength last year. Can you give us the Magnum revenues in the quarter? 
York Ragen: Well I guess, I mean what we can say is C&I was up 76%. Organically we still saw some modest growth organically. So the majority of the C&I growth was Magnum. But we did still -- saw modest organic growth on the C&I side, so I think that's -- to be able to zero in from that standpoint. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then can you maybe bifurcate within that 34% growth was portable or home standby and outlier was one kind of notably better or were they both kind of in that range? 
York Ragen: They were both - well, as we talked they were both strong double digit growth, so no -- I mean there wasn't like one was way up and one was way down. They both were strong solid? 
Jeffrey Hammond: But there wasn't one that was plus 45 and one that was plus 15, either. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: No. 
York Ragen: No. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: And frankly Jeff I was -- the residential business, we really didn't have any outage events but for that Derecho? 
York Ragen: On the last day of the quarter. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: On the last day of the quarter, I mean we track outages and in tracking those outages, I mean we've tracked them now for 3 or 4 years, we saw some of the lowest ratings prior to that event for Q1 and Q2 than we've seen in a long time. So I mean it was really -- it was a very mild winter, so there really wasn't a lot of winter events. Obviously here in Q3 the summer months have been, in particular July has been more active relative to just the kinds of outages. But certainly I think that we're pretty pleased with our performance and res given the fact that we just had -- we really had no outages for the first 6 months of the year. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay, great. And then just you mentioned kind of the rational for Australia, are there any other obvious markets like Australia and what are kind of -- I mean is it management capacity, is it finding the right partner? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes. I mean from an obviousness standpoint there are some other markets around the world that we would say kind of approximate what we're zeroing in on, whether it's rich availability of nat gas where power quality is an issue and where home values are elevated. But they are more scattered, I mean you get beyond Australia, those -- there are pockets of them everywhere around the world frankly. I mean we're finding them in the Ukraine, we're finding them in parts of Latin America, the Caribbean, there are some very obvious areas like that that you would expect that a backup power system, a home standby generator would be something that that would be -- somebody would want to obtain.
 From a management resource standpoint, clearly that's always going to be a constraint when you are expanding. It's been a constraint on the company, we've added a lot of people over the last 12 months here. It's part of what you see in our operating expense line in terms of maybe not getting the kind of leverage that some people might expect off of that. We believe those are very wise investments to make for our future. We need to make those. Some of its missionary work like what we're doing here in Australia and going out and doing in other parts of the world, but we also have from a product standpoint you have to develop certain products for local markets, right, we have a very North American centric product offering, it's highly regulated the North American market. Therefore the product has cost, additional in it that, frankly it may not be needed in other parts of the world.
 So in terms of getting the right product offering, in terms of getting the right distribution partner that you alluded to is also critical. So again we've put a roadmap together, we think that we're going to be executing on that roadmap very aggressively here over the next several years. Australia was a good step, we've been hammering away at Latin America over the last 12 months, seeing some good movement there in terms of adding new distribution. It's taking a while to just get that distribution on board which it does again because of your spreading yourself thinner into other languages and other cultures and product mixes and things for those local markets but we're figuring it out, and it's going to get -- we've said all along with the upside with going global is it's a big upside but it's going to take a while to get there. We're going to do it as we can in certain countries organically like what we're doing in Australia and in other countries.
 Frankly, it may make more sense for us to look at M&A as a better way to or partnerships or JVs or some other way to get into other markets more quickly. So we're evaluating all of that and stay tuned, you're going to see more that from us. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Zach Larkin with Stephens. 
Chris Godby: This is Chris Godby in for Zack Larkin. So first of all thinking about the margin profile a little bit, given the mix impact of Magnum, do gross margin levels going forward feel sort of similar to what you saw in this quarter? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: You're talking the outlook, I mean? 
Chris Godby: Exactly, kind of looking forward at your gross margin would you expect levels similar to this quarter given the mix impact of Magnum as this quarter was a little bit lower than kind of what we've seen historically or would you expect kind of return to more normal levels? 
York Ragen: Well, I think what we've been experienced has been the normal level ever since purchasing Magnum, so I think to answer your question I think it's, it'd be more consistent maybe some upticks here as mix may change a bit but and some moderation, realization modernized -- moderation commodities but I wouldn't expect it to be dramatically different from current levels. 
Chris Godby: Okay great. And then also given the significant outage events in 2011 and what you've seen so far this year, do you have an estimate as to how penetrated your end markets may become by year end? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Well right now, we've been consistent in saying it's about 2.5% of US households, and frankly there are so many US households and every one percent of penetration in the market as we define it relative to our opportunities that is really about 50 million US households. And that's, so 1% would be 500,000 homes, so that's a lot of generators I don't think it's -- and we're talking in total market as well.
 So if we move to 2.6, 2.7% by the end of year that would be -- that would probably somewhere in that range but it's going to take, it takes a lot to move that needle. We see those outage events as great opportunities for us increase awareness on the category, more and more people are talking about home standby generators which is great for the category and it's something that we've -- we continue to work on in terms of education, in terms of how we pursue that market with being a lot more direct in our marketing activities, getting a lot smarter in how to sell this product, getting a lot smarter in helping our dealers get a lot smarter in terms of developing those dealers and turning them into the kinds of sales instruments that we need out on the street selling those products but it's a slog, I mean it takes a while to grow a market. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. 
Brian Drab: Just wanted to ask couple more questions on Australia actually first, and you mentioned that the penetration rate there is low today. Can you talk a little bit about who the competition is in that market? Why the penetration rate is low and I'm assuming it's a lack of effort more than a lack of opportunity. And what sort of distribution networks that competitors have? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Right. 
Brian Drab: Yes. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: That's a great question. We see the penetration rate as nearly zero, I mean I'd say it's frankly there is just not a lot going on there. The competitors who are they're the same guys that are here in the US, and so, and the way they appear to be going to market and I can't speak for them directly but the way they appear to be going to market is roughly the same where they're going to market here. Although maybe a little more heavy reliance on outdoor power equipment dealers as opposed to electrical contractors. So again I think we have a lot to learn about this market, we think that because of our broad product offering, because of our competitiveness and pricing, because of the support that we give our distribution partners from a marketing standpoint and sales standpoint.
 We think that we can approach that market similarly the way we approach it here in the US, but we haven't quite figured that out yet but right now it looks like a fairly greenfield site relative to just not, just a lot of wide space. There is not, there is really nobody else doing anything there, it's for lack of --probably a lack of focus, lack of effort and frankly the same reason they get low percentages here in the US is probably the same reason they're getting low percentages there. 
Brian Drab: Okay, thanks. And one other thing and we were talking to Mike Harris about this recently but I wanted to get your take on it too, how do you think about the impact of a particular outage event with respect to whether there was an outage event in that geography the year before. And for example, we have these outages recently in the Midwest and in the Mid Atlantic states of last year we had Irene and flooding hit those same regions. Is it, would you -- would your business be more impacted if there was a similar size event in a different geography or in the same geography the next year? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes it's really the time delta between events in a particular market has an impact, has a significant impact. And really it's a compounding effect, what happens is when you get an event in a region where there hasn't been any significant events in long time and I'm talking about years, years and years. What happens is, and because this category is still so new we oftentimes don't have their kind of distribution channel that has been built to handle an increase in baseline demand.
 So the first step generally when an event happens is building out distribution, frankly. And so it really takes a second event within a couple of years after that even some set, some point whether it's 8 weeks like it was the case with the event in the snow even after Irene or as of the case here it's 8 months after that snow event with this Derecho, that compounding effect it gets magnified because you've got additional distribution partners in the market that you didn't have during the first go around.
 So I think that does have a significant impact and so I guess to answer your question more bluntly in a mark, if you get an area and I won't use in area like Florida because Florida has had a lot of events, distribution is pretty well built out of there. If you get an event in Florida, a hurricane or something if that could have a nice impact for the company, not a nice impact obviously for the home owners there but it certainly has an impact on us more positively than it would say an event in some place that hasn't had a major events in the long time, like it could've happened in Kentucky or some other -- I'm picking a state but a state where events are not frequently. So that does have an impact and we think that distribution, the build out on distribution plays a big role in that. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Stanley Elliott: Question on expectations for power washers, you talked about picking up some new distribution on the residential side. Is there a way to, I don't know prepackage or package that's the right way to think about it but with the leading share that you guys have on the portable generator side maybe talk about some expectations for power washer kind of ramping up as well. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes, so on the power washer product category we reentered that, Stanley, about a year ago now, that was a market that we were very prevalent back in 1990s, we built the market frankly, there were others in it at the time but we took it to a different level relative to mass merchants and the DIY retailers and we had a very capable team at that time that did an awesome job with that product category.
 We learned a lot, we still have some of those individuals here at the company and when we decided to reenter that category certainly leveraging our position after reentering portable generators was definitely in our math. The channel partners are roughly the same, portable generators are by and large a retail channel game, power washer is the same, a lot of times the buyers -- not in all cases, but the buyers for these products at mass merchants is generally the same individual. So we were able to build on some of our relationships there.
 And I think probably more importantly what has surprised us a little bit is the strength of the brand and the brand, the recognition of our brand in that market place. It's been refreshing to see how people have received it. And I think our success in portable generators have given us some creditability in going out and getting back in this market. We feel, we're feeling pretty good about where we were going with innovating in this category, it's line review season right now so we don't have any direct feedback that we can give you about 2013 but we're certainly planning as if we could end up with some additional market share there, for 2013. Just how much it's going to be really the result of where these line reviews end up.
 And line reviews are tough and our competitors are tough, they're very good, they've been in this market a long time and they understand the market and they certainly want to hold on to their share. So I don't think we are going to delude ourselves into thinking that we're just going to come in and take it all. 
Stanley Elliott: All right. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: But we are, I think we're cautiously optimistic that we are going to be a large player in this market place in the next several years. 
Stanley Elliott: Very good. And then, just shifting gears talking about acquisition potential down the road, I mean what sort of product categories as you guys are looking to kind of diversify and build out what you already have going on. I mean if there is anything to talk about generally speaking just from, just from a pure knowledge standpoint? 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: Yes, we don't comment specifically on the M&A pipeline but I think what we can say is that what would interest us most would be companies, I mean a lot like Magnum when you look at engine driven products that have, where we have the capability to take things that we do well here at the company from manufacturing and operations of global supply and leverage that or areas where we can leverage our distribution with other products. If we can find other product categories that fit well into our existing distribution, we've built a very robust distribution pipeline for our products here, so where the products could go into that.
 I think generally if I think in terms of engine powered products because that's a bit of where our expertise lies. I would tell you the area that from an M&A standpoint that we continue to look at as I said in my previous comments, would it make more sense geographically to get into some markets through an acquisition. We're looking at that, that's something I think is a little bit of a -- it's a bit of a harder step than it would be buying a domestic company here to expand into other engine powered products but yet I think of maybe at an important step in our development to go global and that's something that we're actively pursuing opportunities as they come and we think that the next several years there are some things that could be actionable, depends on where the global economy goes, depends on how our business goes but I think you could look at the Magnum acquisition as really kind of the first foray.
 We've actually completed now 3 acquisitions in really the last, it would be in the last 18 months and 2 of them very small, one of them Magnum much larger but we are ramping up a pipeline here and we believe that there is an opportunity to do some more that with the strength of our balance sheet and some of the areas where we want to grow with our strategy. 
Stanley Elliott: Yes. And then from a cash flow perspective, what are the expectations for inventories kind of as we finish up the year? 
York Ragen: Yes I mean I think as Aaron mentioned, commenting to the season here at the end of June we seasonally ramp up our inventory levels for the season and then the expectation is we will work that inventory down throughout the second half of the year. So should get a positive contribution of cash flow from working capital through the second half of the year as a result. 
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Aaron Jagdfeld for closing remarks. 
Aaron P. Jagdfeld: We want to thank everybody for your time this morning and we look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you all for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-08 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Generac Holdings Inc. Earnings Call. My name is Janeda, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. York Ragen, CFO. Please proceed. 
York Ragen: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. With me today is Aaron Jagdfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We will begin our call today by commenting on forward-looking statements. Certain statements made during this presentation, as well as other information provided from time to time by Generac or its employees, may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. Please see our earnings release or our SEC filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these measures, including reconciliation to comparable US GAAP measures, is available in our earnings release and SEC filings. I'll now turn the call over to Aaron. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report our first quarter 2012 results this morning, which we believe demonstrates our strong execution and the significant earnings power of Generac, as we recorded $294.6 million in net sales and $75.8 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Demand for our products increased to record levels following the multiple outage events that impacted the US during the second half of 2011 and was a large driver of our 138% year-over-year sales growth. 
 Our ability to rapidly respond to this substantial increase in demand is a direct result of the efforts of our dedicated work force and our flexible operations. With the significant increase in production during the quarter, we were able to improve lead times for our products, allowing us to quickly fulfill the increased demand that occurred in the second half of 2011 and into the first quarter of 2012. 
 With only 2.5% of US households owning a home standby generator, we believe last year's outage events have created significant awareness for this growing product category. As we've experienced in the past, we expect this increased awareness will accelerate the adoption of these products, leading to a new and higher baseline for home standby generator demand over the longer term. In addition to increased home standby sales, we also saw considerable strength in portable generator shipments as we continue to gain share in this market. Our success in portable generators after reentering this product category less than four years ago further solidifies our leading position in providing a full set of backup power solutions for the residential market. 
 Also, while we are still in the early stages of both programs, we were encouraged by the first quarter results related to our recent residential product introductions of power washers and Honeywell licensed generators. In addition to executing on the significant increase in residential product demand, the Magnum Products acquisition also contributed to our year-over-year sales growth as end market demand for portable power equipment remained strong. With little to no overlap with Generac's products, distribution channels and end markets, the Magnum acquisition brings further diversification to our business while also providing cross selling opportunities for our sales teams. As we further integrate Magnum's operations, we are on track to achieve our cost synergy targets. We commented last quarter on our view that the Magnum acquisition will prove to be an attractive use of shareholder capital. And after two quarters under Generac's ownership, we continue to see Magnum as a complementary and strategic investment.
 Our significant organic revenue growth and the Magnum Products acquisition combined to drive a substantial increase in net income, earnings per share and free cash flow for the quarter. We have generated over $180 million of free cash flow over the last 12 months ended March 31, 2012. The free cash flow generation capabilities of Generac are what set us apart from many of our peers. Our attractive margins, efficient use of capital and favorable tax attributes have allowed us to significantly reduce our outstanding debt, as we have paid down approximately $166 million over the last six quarters. 
 As a result of our strong free cash flows, we are also announcing a special cash dividend this morning of up to $10 per share. Our ability to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders is attributable to our strong conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, which has led us to achieve our stated leverage target of 2X consolidated net debt to EBITDA. As part of this proposed special cash dividend, we plan to execute a recapitalization in which we intend to incur, subject to market and other conditions, approximately $650 million of additional debt to fund this special cash dividend. This special dividend will highlight for our shareholders the value of the cash flows from our business, and we are confident that our business model will allow us to accommodate this additional leverage. We believe the current financing markets afford us a cost effective and flexible source of capital to execute this transaction, and we believe our new capital structure will provide us with the flexibility to further invest in future organic growth initiatives as well as pursue additional bolt-on acquisitions that fit our strategy. I would now like to turn the call back over to York to discuss first quarter results in more detail. York? 
York Ragen: Thanks, Aaron. As previously mentioned, net sales for the first quarter 2012 were $294.6 million, a 137.6% increase as compared to $124 million in the first quarter of 2011. On a pro forma basis when including the results of Magnum Products for the entire period, last 12 months net sales as of March 31, 2012, were $1.038 billion. 
 Looking at net sales by product class, residential product sales increased 153.1% to $175.1 million in the first quarter of 2012 from net sales of $69.2 million in the first quarter of 2011. Generac once again experienced robust shipment levels of home standby generators as a result of the increased awareness of these products, caused by the multiple major outage events that occurred during the second half of 2011. As we have previously stated, the majority of our residential product sales relate to home standby generators. In the first quarter of 2012, we experienced significant year-over-year growth in shipments of these products through a combination of increased production rates along with continued strength in order rates in comparison to the prior year. As Aaron mentioned, as a result of our significant increase in production rates for home standby products during the first quarter, we were able to improve the lead times for these products, helping to fulfill the surge in demand, which followed the 2011 major outages. 
 With regards to portable generators, we continued to see strength for these products during the first quarter of 2012 with strong double-digit growth versus prior year. We once again expanded our shelf space at retail with our portable generator product line, and as a result, we believe we expanded our market share and now hold a leading position for these products in the US market. Also contributing modestly to the revenue growth for residential products in the first quarter of 2012 was increased revenue from our power washer product line and our Honeywell licensed generators, which were first introduced in the first and second quarters of 2011. We continue to roll out distribution for these products, and we are encouraged by our progress to date. 
 Looking at our commercial and industrial products, net sales increased 137% to $105 million in the first quarter of 2012 from $44.3 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the Magnum Products acquisition, strong shipments of natural gas gen sets into the industrial dealer channel and increased shipments to industrial national account customers. In addition, net sales during the first quarter also benefited from the resolution of certain previously delayed shipments caused by a short-term shortage in the supply of certain components sourced overseas. As a reminder, there can be some variability in our C&I product shipments from quarter to quarter, primarily due to the timing of capital spending by our national account customers. 
 With regards to Magnum, results during the first quarter of 2012 came in above our expectations as strong demand from energy and construction end markets continued. Key drivers of growth for Magnum include the replacement of aging fleets by rental equipment companies, the overall expansion of rental fleets due to an ongoing secular shift toward equipment rentals and continued market share gains with Magnum's mobile generator and mobile pump product lines. Looking forward, we expect to take advantage of future cross selling opportunities, as we have had some early successes with Generac's industrial national account customers purchasing Magnum's mobile generators, and we continue to attract a number of cross selling leads across sales teams. 
 Our progress to date with the integration has been very favorable as we work towards our goal of achieving roughly $2 million in cost synergies. Much of the savings we are projecting will come primarily as a result of improved purchasing scale with certain components and commodities as well as from improved utilization and efficiencies in Magnum's operations. We will continue to realize these cost synergies throughout 2012 and remain on track to achieve the full realization on an annualized basis by the end of the year. 
 Our other product sales category improved to $14.5 million in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 38% from prior year first quarter sales of $10.5 million. As a reminder, this product category is mostly comprised of the sales of aftermarket service parts as well as loose engines to lawn and garden OEMs. The increase in the other product category primarily relates to the contribution of parts revenue from the Magnum acquisition, elevated service parts sales as a result of focused initiatives to drive increased parts sales to our distribution partners and increased parts demand that was generated by the major outage events that took place in recent quarters. 
 Gross margin for the first quarter of 2012 was 37.7%, compared to 36.8% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 38.1% in the prior year first quarter. The mix impact from the addition of Magnum Products sales reduced total company gross margins by almost 200 basis points during the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter period last year. Mostly offsetting this decline, gross margin during the first quarter was impacted favorably by a higher mix of home standby generators and a lower mix of portable generators. In addition, the positive impact from price increases implemented throughout 2011 and improved overhead absorption during the current year quarter was largely offset by higher commodity costs relative to the prior year. 
 Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2012 increased by $15.5 million or 43% as compared to the first quarter of 2011. These additional expenses were driven primarily by increased variable operating expenses on a substantial increase in organic sales, operating expenses associated with Magnum, increased sales, engineering and administrative infrastructure to support the strategic growth initiatives and higher baseline sales levels of the company and increased incentive compensation expenses as a result of the company's financial performance during the quarter. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased to $75.8 million in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $27.5 million in the same period last year. Pro forma for the Magnum acquisition, when including the results for Magnum for the entire period, last 12 months adjusted EBITDA as of March 31, 2012 was $245.9 million. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2012 increased to $30.1 million compared to $4.8 million for the first quarter of 2011. 
 It is important to note the first quarter of 2012 includes a more normalized GAAP tax rate of 38.8% as compared to a tax rate of 1.9% in the prior year first quarter. As previously discussed, prior to the fourth quarter of 2011, a full valuation allowance was recorded with regard to the company's net deferred tax assets, resulting in a nominal effective tax rate. As was first the case in the fourth quarter of 2011, a full valuation allowance is no longer required with regard to the company's net deferred tax assets, and therefore, a full income tax provision was recorded in the first quarter of 2012. We expect to have a normalized tax rate in the 38% to 40% range going forward, given there is no longer a valuation allowance to offset. More importantly, we will continue to experience significant cash tax savings from our favorable tax attributes, which include a step-up in asset basis and NOL carryforwards relating to the 2006 change in control transaction, and to a lesser extent, the recent Magnum acquisition, which are expected to generate significant cash tax savings into the future. As a result, we believe we will not be paying federal income taxes for the foreseeable future, which is the reason we are only reflecting cash taxes in our adjusted net income calculation. 
 Adjusted net income, as defined in our earnings release, increased to $66.1 million versus $17.1 million in the prior year first quarter. The substantial improvement in adjusted net income is attributable to improved operating earnings during the quarter resulting from the 137.6% increase in revenue, including the incremental results from the Magnum acquisition. 
 Interest expense in the first quarter of 2012 declined to $5.7 million compared to $6 million in the same period last year. The slight decline in interest expense was the result of approximately $82 million in debt prepayments over the last 12 months, mostly offset by a modest increase in the weighted average cost of capital, cost of debt. 
 Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.44 compared to $0.07 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted diluted net income per share, as reconciled in our earnings release, was $0.96 for the current year quarter compared to $0.25 per share in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $36.4 million in the first quarter of 2012, which was up significantly from $11.1 million in the same period last year. Strong operating earnings were partially offset by increased working capital investment, driven by the replenishment of inventory levels to support higher production rates and seasonal build requirements. 
 Inventory was purchased during the first quarter to support the significant increase in production for home standby generators. In addition, as we prepare for the upcoming summer storm season, we are replenishing finished good inventory levels that were depleted in the second half of 2011. Free cash flow over the past 12 months was $183 million, representing 93% of the adjusted net income reported during that time period.
 As we announced today, the company is pursuing a recapitalization to fund a special cash dividend to shareholders. Before discussing further details about the transaction, we wanted to review our current capital structure and recent trend in leverage ratios. Looking at our capital structure as of March 31, 2012, we had $573.7 million of term loan debt outstanding, net of unamortized original issued discount, and $91.7 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in consolidated net debt of $482 million and a consolidated net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2X. This compares to a 3.7X net debt leverage ratio at March 31, 2011. 
 Historically, we have demonstrated the ability to pay down debt through our strong free cash flow generation. Specifically, total debt has been reduced by $156 million during the past six quarters using cash on the balance sheet, resulting in a significantly improved leverage ratio. The company's net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio has declined from 4.1X at the end of the first quarter of 2010 to 2.0X by the end of the first quarter of 2012.
 I'd now like to provide some additional details regarding our announcement of a proposed special cash dividend to shareholders. We are currently pursuing a recapitalization in which we intend to incur, subject to market and other conditions, approximately $650 million of additional debt to fund in large part the special cash dividend of up to $10 per share on our outstanding common stock. As part of this transaction, we expect to enter into new debt financing in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.2 billion, which is expected to be comprised of approximately $800 million of senior secured debt and the remaining in senior unsecured financing. The proceeds from the new debt financing will be used to pay the special cash dividend and to refinance our existing credit facilities. 
 In addition, we anticipate our current $150 million unfunded revolver will be replaced with the similar-sized asset-backed revolver. The declaration of the special cash dividend is conditioned upon obtaining new debt financing under acceptable terms. We currently expect our Board of Directors will declare and authorize payment of this special cash dividend before the end of the second quarter of 2012. 
 Given our strong free cash flow conversion, which includes minimal cash taxes from our significant deferred tax assets, we're very comfortable in our ability to continue funding our growth initiatives while also servicing our debt. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Aaron to provide some additional comments with regards to our 2012 outlook. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Thanks, York. Primarily as a result of our increased full year outlook for residential sales, we are revising upward our guidance for full year 2012. Previously we were forecasting net sales to increase at a mid to high teens rate as compared to 2011. We now expect that total net sales will increase at the high end of this range, growing at a projected high teen's rate as compared to the prior year. Our revised guidance continues to assume no material improvement in the macroeconomic environment and no comparable major outage events during the balance of this year. Specifically, for the second quarter of 2012, total net sales on an as-reported basis are forecasted to increase between 35% and 40% in comparison to the second quarter of 2011. 
 As we commented during our last call, lead times for home standby generators at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 extended out as far as 8 to 10 weeks for most of our most popular models. The accelerated ramp in our production rates for home standby generators since the beginning of the year, coupled with a mild winter, which enabled the installation of these products to continue throughout the season, has helped to bring lead times at the end of the first quarter down to approximately three to four weeks. Looking forward, we expect demand for home standby generators to remain strong over the next several quarters relative to the most recent comparable periods with no major outage events. This expectation is due to the afterglow the company historically experiences after major power outages as homeowners look to protect themselves from future outages. As the initial surge in demand levels off, we believe that the awareness and additional distribution points added will create a new and higher baseline level of demand for home standby generators as we move towards the second half of 2012. 
 Increased awareness of home standby generators, combined with the more targeted approach to finding prospective buyers for these products as well as greater distribution, are all contributing factors to the baseline growth of this product category. As a result, total company net sales for the second half of 2012 are expected to increase at a high teen's rate in comparison to the previous baseline level experienced in the second half of 2010, which again is the most recent comparable period with no major outage events. For reference, total company pro forma net sales for the second half of 2010 were $370.4 million. 
 Consistent with our previously issued guidance, gross margins are expected to be approximately flat during 2012 compared to the prior year. The unfavorable mix impact of adding Magnum Products is expected to be offset by a higher sales mix shift toward home standby generator shipments and a lower mix of portable generators. Additionally, the realization of price increases, improved manufacturing overhead absorption, commodity cost moderation and cost reduction projects should also impact gross margins favorably throughout the balance of 2012. 
 In line with our previous guidance, as reported consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding amortization of intangibles are expected to be slightly higher as compared to 2011 as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our strategic growth initiatives and our overall higher level of sales. As a result of this revised outlook, adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-teens range compared to 2011. While second quarter 2012 adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase in the mid-20% range over the comparable period prior year.
 In closing, we believe our first quarter results clearly provide a tangible example of the significant earnings power of Generac's business model. We have continued to grow revenues through product innovation, expanded distribution and increased awareness of home standby generators. Our powering ahead strategy, which we implemented less than two years ago, has served as a template for our investments in the company. In addition to our accomplishments over the last several quarters, we continue to make important progress on a number of our powering-ahead-related initiatives that we expect will drive our longer-term growth. These initiatives are linked to each of the four strategic objectives of growing the residential market, gaining share in the commercial and industrial market, diversification through new products and services and expanding our geographic reach. 
 In addition to our powering ahead initiatives, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the powerful macro growth drivers for our business. In particular, prolonged underinvestment in the aging electrical grid in the United States is leading to more frequent and longer power disruptions for homeowners and business owners. With the broadest product offering in the industry, we believe Generac is well positioned for the longer-term opportunities that will result from the continuing increase in demand for backup power. Our leadership position in natural gas generators in particular is allowing us to capitalize on the secular trend away from diesel-fueled units and towards cleaner burning, more cost-effective natural gas fueled solutions. Add to these macro drivers a potential future recovery in residential investment and non-residential construction, and we believe our prospects for growth are very compelling. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Thank you again for joining us. At this time, we'd like to open the call up for questions. Operator? 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Zack Larkin with Stephens. 
Chris Godby: This is Chris Godby in for Zack Larken at Stephens. So first of all, the $370.4 million number, that was for the second half of 2010 pro forma including Magnum, correct? 
York Ragen: Correct. 
Chris Godby: Okay. Great. And then looking ahead for the remaining three quarters of this year, how should we maybe think about seasonality this year? Will you expect it to follow typical patterns that you've seen in the past? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think that’s, Chris, how we're viewing it. In years without a storm – or, excuse me, in years after a year of storms like we had last year, we typically see seasonality take a little bit different track with the first half of the year being more robust than the second half. And that of course is assuming that there are no major comparable events in the second half of this year. 
York Ragen: I think our guidance for second quarter, talking about second quarter being up 35% to 40% compared to second quarter of 2011, that's sort of gives you some guide as to how that's playing out. And then I think the second half statements in terms of that new and higher baseline compared to similar periods without outages, again, that’s – again, those forecasts are assuming no major outages for the balance of 2012. Our guidance would indicate how that would play out. 
Chris Godby: Okay. Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then can you talk a little bit more about how the mild winter affected you in the quarter? It seems like maybe we had a little bit of a pull forward affect in terms of installations. Can you maybe talk about that a little bit more? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: I think there's probably two ways to look at the mild winter. Certainly from an installation standpoint, our distribution was able to get out in areas of the country like the Northeast and the Midwest, where typically in January or February, it would be awfully difficult to install these products. So we traditionally see installs slow down at that time of the year. But with the winter playing out the way that it did, distribution was able to continue to install, and therefore, we believe, worked down their own backlog internally, if you want to think of it that way. If they had orders that they had taken and they were waiting to install product. At the same time, we had ramped up our production very aggressively, and so the combination of us ramping up our production very aggressively in Q1 and the combination of the installers and distribution being able to continue to put those products into the field, we were able to work down the lead times very quickly. Again from that 8- to 10-week range at the end of the year to something in the 3 to 4-week range. 
 That’s the one side of the answer, Chris. The other side of it is, obviously, with a mild winter, although we were able to increase our portable generator sales at a good clip year-over-year in terms of first quarter numbers, a lot of that was due to some pickup in shelf space that we had and some pipeline fill coming off of the strong second half of last year. But right now, inventories are at a pretty good level, I would say, going into the season. Normally at this point, retailers may be looking at restocking more aggressively out of the season because if normal winter weather plays out, they generally have regions of the country where they're depleted in inventory as a result of winter weather. But that of course didn't happen this year. 
Chris Godby: Okay. Great. And then one final question for you. Can you maybe discuss the competitive environment you're seeing right now? In particular, can you maybe give us an update on what you believe your market share in your end markets currently? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Sure. As we stated on the residential standby side, we believe our market share remains in the 70-percentile range. It's a market that there's not a lot of tracking information out there, so those are management estimates, of course, but pieced together, we think, to the best of our ability. On the portable generator side, as we've stated in our prepared remarks today, we do believe over the last several quarters we've reestablished ourselves as the number one market share player in the US market for portable generators. We believe the market share, depending on what report you look at, is anywhere between 20% and 25% in terms of share. And you can look at it. It's a little bit different from units to dollars, but it's roughly in the same range, in that 20 to 25-percentile range. 
 On the C&I side of our business, if we just look at total C&I kind of ex-Magnum here for a second, we believe that in the stationary products market, our market share is somewhere in that 12% to 15% range. And then Magnum holds a leading share position in North America in light towers. Again, we've publically stated that that’s somewhere in the 30%-plus range, and they're an up-and-coming player in the mobile generator and mobile pump space. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. 
Jerry Revich: Good morning. I'm wondering, gentlemen, if you can give us an update on your product development plan on the industrial and natural gas generator product line? Any size range or extensions that you're considering. And also I'm wondering if you could give us some more context on the rising interest level your citing in natural gas over diesel generators for these applications? Perhaps quantify that with order rates and inquiries so far this year. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: That's a good question, Jerry. Natural gas, obviously, has come to the forefront here most recently. We've been very focused on that niche end of the market for the last 20 years. So I guess we're finally in vogue when it comes to nat gas. We've developed a lot of technologies and a lot of capabilities around natural gas, not only on the residential side, clearly, where we dominate that space. But also in the light commercial and the industrial space, where we've continued to see, as you mentioned, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks this morning, kind of a long-term secular shift that is starting to accelerate somewhat here towards natural gas. A lot of that shift is occurring as a result of diesel products becoming frankly higher priced. Diesel engines have become much more complex due to the regulatory environment over the last seven to eight years. And it's not that natural gas gen sets or any less clean or less complex, it's just, frankly, the fuel source that it starts out is cleaner than diesel is. And as it's cleaner, it needs less pretreatment and less after treatment in terms of what we need to do with the emissions of the equipment. 
 So what we're seeing in our own product line, in terms of product development, we've got the largest natural gas product line in the industry. We continue to add positions to that both on the topside of that product line in terms of going larger into C&I, as well as down in the light commercial space, where we've made a number of changes to our product relative to the engines that power those products around certain engine ranges where we are now the manufacturer of certain of those engines. So that's changed for us here recently in the last couple of years. And we believe gives us an improved position as it relates to supply and also cost position in many of those products. 
 I think as far as trends, what we've seeing here, again, we've been seeing a long-term shift. But that is beginning to accelerate and, as we've said, the long-term growth rates for gas sets we believe is spark ignited, as it's referred to in our industry, we believe are going to continue to grow at a rate that outstrips that of diesel. Natural gas, you don't have the storage issues that you have with diesel. You've got first piece costs that, in a certain range of products, you get underneath kind of under 200 kilowatt and smaller products that you'd use in light commercial applications like small footprint retail stores, restaurants, C stores, bank branches, health clinics, things of that nature. The first piece cost advantage over natural gas over diesel is sometimes as much as 25% or 30% of the cost of the machine. So that clearly, from a return on investment standpoint for a business, makes a natural gas powered generator a pretty attractive investment. 
Jerry Revich: And, Aaron, on the second part of the question, can you just quantify the year-to-date quarter growth for nat gas powered industrial gen sets versus diesel for your business? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: We haven't traditionally broken that out, Jerry, but that's something that, again, we point to the longer-term trend are greater for gas then they are for diesel. That would apply in the short-term as well. You're seeing that in our results, exactly. 
Jerry Revich: And, York, what were your Magnum construction equipment sales in the quarter? And what does your sales guidance imply for the Magnum business for the year? 
York Ragen: I guess what I could say is about, if you look at our growth for the total company, 137.6%, about maybe a quarter of that was related to Magnum. So you could get some idea in terms of organic versus Magnum growth. And we're not necessarily breaking out specifically our outlook between Magnum and Generac, but I think from a C&I standpoint, I think we said last quarter that both Generac and Magnum C&I product sales would grow at a similar pace in 2012 from an outlook standpoint. 
Jerry Revich: And, York, I guess since them we've seen some much more positive CapEx announcements out of your rental customers, so I'm wondering if you've revised your guidance to reflect that. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: I don't think specifically. Jerry, we talk to those guys quite a bit, and so our forecast, our numbers earlier in the year certainly contemplated that the rental companies were going to be fairly aggressive in CapEx. Obviously with the United Rentals purchase of RSC, that's given us pause here to kind of reevaluate -- RSC was not a strong customer of Magnum, so there may be some additional upside opportunity for us there. We're sorting through that and trying to understand just kind of how the procurement landscape is going to fall out once the consolidation and integration is completed in that acquisition. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. 
Christopher Glynn: I had a question on C&I sort of underlying trends and run rates since it seems like the guide has some deceleration. At least approaching an elegist [ph] to residential. So I was just wondering how much you think backlog resolution contributed in the quarter. And also, what do you think the awareness impact was on the C&I segment? We haven't really talked about that. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Let me touch that first, Chris. The awareness in the C&I, there's a much longer tail on that. Homeowners tend to react quicker than businesses do. For businesses, the purchase of a generator tends to be a little bit more involved, a little more thought out, and there are obviously budgetary cycles and things that you have to work through with businesses that you don't necessarily have as top of [ph] constraints with homeowners on. If a homeowner wants a generator for their home after an outage, they're going to go out and figure out how to get one. Businesses are -- it's a little bit longer tail to that. 
 So as the afterglow for businesses, our history and our perspective on that is that, that will tend to trail a little bit longer than will the homeowner piece. The homeowner piece is going to be a little bit more immediate, and the C&I side will experience some of that, in the Northeast in particular here, probably over the back half of this year into 2013. And maybe even a little bit longer. What it really does is it highlights for certain of our national account customers where they have weaknesses in their operations in certain regions of the country. So some of our telecommunications customers in particular, they've focused on building out their networks in the northeast because there are obviously large population concentrations there. And so where they saw power outage interruptions from the events last year, they may decide to elevate their CapEx spending more geared towards projects in those regions around backup power. 
 I don't think -- we're probably not really reflecting too much of that yet because again it’s a slower -- it's a little bit slower tail. I would also remind you that when you look back at the second quarter of last year for C&I, as we've said here, our results can be a bit lumpy as it relates to C&I because of our national account customers' purchasing habits. So we saw last year in CapEx spending for those national account customers in the second quarter was a little bit of a -- there was some projects that rolled out that we don't necessarily think will repeat this year. So that might be part of the deceleration you're seeing relative to the residential results that we're talking about. 
 As far as the impact of the resolution of the first part of your question, the impact of the resolution of the backlog issue related to the component supply chain, we had a Japanese supplier that had issues after the tsunami last year. Really about maybe $5 million to $6 million of the C&I sales in Q1 would be related to the resolution of that issue. 
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then on the production levels you hit in the quarter, pretty impressive. Did you have to engage in any contract manufacturing or anything like that? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: On the home standby generators side we did not. We have a very flexible operation here. We pride ourselves on that. And every once in a while, when you get events like this, you get to test out just how flexible you are. I was incredibly impressed with our operations team, and in particular our supply chain team. And we have a very deep supply chain group here in terms of competencies in what we do. And the ability to -- and it's not just us going out and hiring people to ramp up our operations here in Wisconsin. It really is -- that same effort has to get repeated throughout supply chain. And some of that supply chain obviously extends overseas as well as domestically here. And it's a lot of coordinated effort, and it really outstripped our expectations, to be frank. That coupled with the ability of distribution to continue installing products throughout the first quarter we think had a pretty material impact on the results. And you see that in the lead times really compressing down probably further than we were expecting them to compress. And really, due to just our outstanding execution as it relates to Q1 production ramp. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Just on the special dividend, can you just talk about the rationale for the magnitude and just how you're thinking about leverage profile going forward? And then, if you can give us any kind of sense of what you're thinking in terms of financing cost? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Absolutely. I'll take the first part of the question, and I'll let York take the financing cost question. But obviously, it's all tied together. The magnitude of the special dividend, Jeff, we analyzed a number of different scenarios and looked at really what is -- I'll step back a second. We've said from a prioritization of the uses of our cash, in the past we've said we wanted to focus on prioritizing cash towards paying down debt. And we had a [inaudible] leverage target out there to be in that kind of 2X -- really we said 2X to 3X range on a consolidated net debt basis to EBITDA. And frankly, we hit that. We achieved it very quickly here in the last couple of years, and we got to that point this past quarter and it just made sense to reevaluate our uses of cash. 
 In terms of the magnitude of the dividend, we thought that -- one of the things that we thought we needed to do was find a better way to highlight the free cash flow of this business for our shareholders and really bring that discussion to the forefront. We have some really unique attributes in this business. And they extend from obviously our -- the margin profile of the products that we sell to the capital efficiency or the efficiency with which we deploy capital of the company. And probably even more important is the tax attributes that we've got, that were generated back in the transaction back in 2006. 
 I think that in order to really evidence the impact and the power of the free cash flows of this business, we felt that some amount of special dividend would help us do that. The right amount, you can pick a range. But we settled on $10 because we felt that, that, from a leverage profile standpoint -- and it's 5X leverage, but I think when you look at 5X, I think you have to put that in -- I think you have to put that in perspective as it relates to analyzing that against a peer group of industrial technology companies. I don’t think it's fair to say that 5X leverage for Generac is necessarily translated into the same leverage ratio for other similar businesses because of the tax attribute. I would say that's probably the primary thing that I don't think exists in other companies. 
 So I think when you look at that and our ability to convert our EBITDA to free cash flow -- 93% here in the last 12 months. I think it's -- that strong free cash flow conversion is, again, you put all that together and we've very comfortable with that 5X leverage, and we're going to work that back down again. And we think -- our forecasts here are we're going to continue to prioritize towards paying down debt. We also wanted to leave ourselves in the new capital structure the flexibility to do a lot of the aggressive things that we're doing right now. We're growing very aggressively organically and from bolt-on M&A as well with deals like Magnum. We wanted to continue to be able to do those things going forward. I guess, York, if you want to tackle the… 
York Ragen: Yes, I think from a cost of debt standpoint, I think today's financing environment is very attractive, and that's another -- in terms of you asked about the rationale for this transaction. That sort of plays into the rationale as well. And from a cost of debt standpoint, we believe we could get this transaction done for approximately 7% overall cost of debt, which again is an attractive rate in this environment. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. Great. So essentially, you go back to 5X and then you focus on deleveraging again, or assess it in the future. 
York Ragen: Right. I think the way we're thinking about it is, we're just resetting our priorities. We sort of achieved our priorities, and now we're resetting them, if you will. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. Great. And then can you give us the Magnum revenue contribution in the quarter? 
York Ragen: Yes. That was, I think I had referred that to our -- of the 137.6% growth year-over-year, about 25% of that came from Magnum. 25% of the 137.6%. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. That's overall. 
York Ragen: Overall total company, as reported. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. Great. So if we look at 2Q, because I'm just trying to understand maybe what was pulled forward, you don't have a particularly tough comp until 3Q, 4Q. And if we back out Magnum coming in, it seems like the core growth is, what, 10% to 15% into 2Q? That seems pretty modest for, given the trends you've kind of been seeing. 
York Ragen: I think Aaron alluded to exceeding our expectations in terms of the production levels and bringing lead times that we referred to. Aaron also talked about some of this -- how some of our sales from our industrial national account customers can vary from quarter to quarter. So on the C&I side you've got that coming in the second quarter… 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes, there's a little bit tougher comp coming in the second quarter because of that last year, that some of those projects are -- they're probably not going to repeat to the same level that they did last year. 
York Ragen: Still I think resi growth is still showing strong year-over-year in the second quarter. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: I do think if you think about it, Jeff, in terms of quarters, Q1, again, as we said, we really were able to ramp up production very quickly and bring our lead times down, probably beyond our expectations initially in Q1, just given the flow through of the product at the end market through distribution and then also our ability to ramp up and execute. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. Do you have a sense of how much the weather and kind of restock pulled forward in the residential business similar to the quantification you called out on the commercial side? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: As it relates to home standby generators, not much. I mean, there's not much of a restocking effort because there's not much stocking that goes on in that category. There is some, but it's not dramatic. I would say that again our comments on portable generators before would probably be -- there's obviously a piece of what happened in Q1 that went to restocking. We also had some new customers that we added in the first quarter for portables that rolled out. So there's a piece of that, that is offsetting probably what would be more of an underlying weakness related to not having had much in the way of outage events in Q1 that would impact our portable demand. 
Jeffrey Hammond: Okay. But on home standby, you got some help from mild weather and installations. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: And installations. 
Jeffrey Hammond: How would you characterize lead time -- I mean, is there still catch-up on home standby? Or have you caught that up because of the milder weather? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Our lead times are pulling in a little bit further now. We're back down to our normal lead times of inside of two weeks. So we were three to four weeks at the end of the quarter. So there's a little bit more pull in here that's occurred as we've kind of caught it really back to our kind of stated lead times of inside of two weeks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. 
Tim Mulrooney: I'm calling in for Brian Drab. We just -- most of our questions have been answered, but one thing I was looking at is the gross margin. And I know that you guided to flat gross margin in 2012. But as you work to improve the operations at Magnum, do you think that you can kind of get back to the levels that you saw in 2009 and 2010? Or is this more the structural gross margin that we should be looking at going forward? 
York Ragen: I think just -- I think we talked about how Magnum, when you layer Magnum on top of Generac, initially in the outset, it was around 250 basis point impact, and as we execute on the $2 million of cost synergies, that should compress that a bit. But I wouldn't expect to make up that entire amount. So I think maybe to answer your question, that would be -- where we're at today would be more indicative of ongoing. More of a mitral [ph] and mix standpoint. 
Tim Mulrooney: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one last thing. I noticed that your G&A was down quite a bit on a sequential basis. Is that because the fourth quarter had a few one-time things going on? Or is this first quarter G&A kind of representative of what we should expect for the rest of the year? 
York Ragen: Well sequentially, I guess it's off a little bit. But I think there's incentive [ph] comp in there as well as we've been adding infrastructure to support our growth initiatives. So I think those are a large part of the drivers. As well as the variable costs and whatnot. And Magnum rolling in, in the fourth quarter had a piece of it too. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. 
Jerry Revich: Just a couple of follow-ups. I'm wondering if you could say more about the power washer contribution in the quarter and what type of sales run rate do you expect for that business as we exit the year? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. That business, Jerry, as you know, this would be our first kind of season, right? We kind of launched those products last year. We introduced them in roughly the end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter last year and began to shop them around to customers, and we did have some customers take those products. It was a pretty modest contribution here in Q1 still. But we like the trajectory of that business, but remember, there is some seasonality there. It's primarily -- it really is kind of a Q1, Q2 game in terms of power washers. There could be some more -- a little bit maybe around certain events like Labor Day and as you get into the holidays. But primarily, it's a spring season type of product. You can think of it more of a lawn and garden type of pattern for seasonality-wise. 
 We're very pleased with our placement there so far. The products have been incredibly well received by the end market. A lot of retailers, a lot of big retailers, already had their season set this year and set without us. And so where we've been -- we've been kind of nibbling on the edges. We have gotten some placement in certain parts of the country with certain of those large retailers. But we're still kind of working through kind of one-off promos to test the products and see how they perform with some of those retailers. And we're in the middle of line reviews right now for next year. And we're pretty excited about the prospects for that business going forward. It's a tough market. It's a competitive market, but we think we've got some innovation there that we're bringing to that market that we believe, for the longer-term, we think we're going to be a player there. 
Jerry Revich: And so based on the line reviews that are complete so far, what's your ready market position that’s in hand heading into next year? And what's the range of upside if the reviews go as you plan and hit your targets? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: I haven't sat and scribbled out a range of reviews. We're not going to give guidance for 2013 on the call. But I do think that it's -- we're kind of in the single-digit market share right now. Very low single-digits. And we're growing. There are a couple of manufacturers out there that dominate the space, and we have our work cut out for us to be a worthy competitor there. So they're not going to roll over and just give us the market. We do think we're going to have to prove our worth for the end consumer in terms of bringing innovation and feature sets to the marketplace that consumers feel are worth paying for and worth putting the Generac brand in their garage. So that's something that, as we work through the year, I think we'll be able to provide a little bit more clarity into that. But right now, there really aren't many of the line reviews that are complete, so I think it'd be pretty premature for us to comment on that. 
Jerry Revich: Okay. And for the residential standby business, can you give us an update on the distribution. You've had a number of training programs over the past couple of quarters in the Northeast. I'm wondering if you could give us a distribution count update? And also, have you been able to make progress on the Honeywell branded generators, or has it been too tough because of the focus on their core business during the install season here? 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Yes. Absolutely. So the first part of the question, Jerry, the residential distribution we've done – obviously, when you get events like we had out east, the other thing that happens in addition to the demand increase for the product is also we get quite a few interested parties in being dealers for the company. And so we have expanded our distribution very nicely in the first quarter of this year. Probably from an inflection point beyond what we would normally go [ph] in terms of a trend, beyond what we would normally see this time of year. So right now our distribution is approaching 4,500 dealers at the end of the quarter. And so that's up from -- we were at over 4,200 at the end of the year, so we've added -- and that's on a net basis, that add. So that has been a nice area for us, and we believe there's going to be – again, part of our comments about this new and higher baseline that gets developed is around adding points of life to points of distribution for the product category because it's so underpenetrated. 
 And so we think that that's a key component of that, and so we're really excited about that. A lot of the training programs that we've done, we've had to really accelerate even further because we've added distribution so quickly. So we've been scrambling, and again, to add the infrastructure here at the company to support more dealers through more dealer development effort, through more training. We've got some really cool programs for our dealers that we rolled out here recently at the beginning of the year at our dealer forums, and we're really excited about where that's going to take our dealer base going forward in terms of making them more successful at selling the product and really identifying where opportunities are for sales.
 On the Honeywell side, that program also we mentioned in our prepared remarks, but that program's done quite well for us. We found that the HVAC space, which is what we're really targeting with that Honeywell brand is an area that's ripe for opportunity relative to the number, the sheer number of dealers and distributors in that space that could use a product category in addition to their heating and cooling products. So it's been very popularly received, obviously in parts of the country like the Northeast that have experienced outages where demand is higher. We are seeing a nice uplift with those products. 
Operator: And at this time we have no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Aaron Jagdfeld for any closing remarks. 
Aaron Jagdfeld: Again, we appreciate everybody's time this morning. And we look forward to speaking to you on our second quarter call. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.
